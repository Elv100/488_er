As we view the evidence as a whole in this connection, there is nothing that authorizes the jury's finding that appellee was directed by appellant or by any one authorized by appellant to go inside of the tank in order to clean it. The only evidence that tends in the slightest degree to support this finding is the testimony of appellee to the effect that he thought that they meant for him to go into the tank in order to clean it, because on the evening before he and other fellow employees had cleaned out another one of appellant's storage tanks by going on the inside of it and attempting to do his work as he did on the morning that he was injured.

The tank was made of steel and had the capacity to hold a thousand barrels of oil. It was 16 feet in diameter and 18 feet high. Oil which had been stored in the tank had been drawn off, leaving a heavy sediment at the bottom of the tank called by oil men "BS." This sediment, according to the evidence, was about 6 inches deep.

After long and repeated questioning on direct and cross examination, Dr. Bailey stated, and several times repeated, that if appellee's condition was not the result or after effects of carbon monoxide gas poisoning then he (Dr. Bailey) was wholly mistaken in his diagnosis of appellee's condition and that it was "all wrong." In other words, as we construe Dr. Bailey's testimony, he testified most positively that if appellee's condition, whatever it is, was not }

That is the undisputed record in this case. And Dr. Barr testified, as we have shown, that the appellee in this case had so completely recovered from the effects of the gas that he had inhaled that he was able to go back to his work within two weeks from the time he came to the hospital, and Dr. Barr's evidence on this point was fully corroborated by every other physician who examined appellee, as we have shown }

If these physicians were testifying truthfully in this case, it is manifest that appellee's injuries from the inhalation of the gas while cleaning the tank were only temporary, and he could not have been awarded justly any amount approaching the award that was made him in this case. We have reached the conclusion, after much consideration, that the only theory upon which we can sustain the amount of the verdict in this case is that Dr. Bailey was correct in his diagnosis of appellee's condition as being the after effects of carbon monoxide gas poisoning. In view of the clear and positive testimony of the five expert chemists who testified in this case, and whose testimony we have quoted above, we are constrained to conclude}
