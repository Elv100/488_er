The injury is of course permanent. It was the left arm. I have been partially paid for my services. The railroad company paid me ten dollars.

I know William Behan. On the 12th of May, 1880, I lived at section house No. 59, on the line of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, in Bowie county, Texas. This section house belongs to the T. & P. Railway Co. Went there to board section men; was employed by the roadmaster to keep the section house and board the men. The lower step of the section house is about fifteen feet from the track. The house is situated on a bank, by a cut about four or five feet high; the track was straight for half a mile above and below the house; the child was hurt May 12, 1880. I went down to a branch that morning to wash; the branch was about two hundred yards from the house, and only a step from the railroad. When I left the house I told my sister to take care of the baby, as the train was coming. When I got to the branch, the train passed me going up grade slowly toward the section house. In a moment or two I heard the bell ring and one sound of the whistle. I was attracted}

I got a sheet, wrapped it around the baby, got in the caboose attached to the train, and went to Texarkana to my mother's house. No one was with me in the caboose except my child, the conductor and train men being, as I supposed, on a different part of the train. The child was eighteen months and nine days old when the accident occurred; had been weaned about two months. I found Finegan, the fireman, with the child when I reached the house. I got to the house before the conductor did. The child was sick for two months; one month we held her in our arms constantly, and now, when the weather is damp and cloudy, the child complains of its arm. My sister resided at the section house with me, and assisted me in cooking and washing for the section men, and always took care of the baby when I was absent from the house. My sister was then over fourteen years of age and well grown for her age. My circumstances were such that I had to do my own housework, washing, ironing and cooking for the section men. There was from eight to twelve section men boarding with me at the section}

I lived at the section house thirteen months. There was no fence around the house in front next to the railroad. The bank was cut down from the steps to the ditch beside the track. The ditch was about two feet deep, with a plank walk leading from the steps across the ditch and on the track; the house was fenced in the rear. The child always played in the back yard. The last time I saw the child before it was hurt, my sister was standing on the gallery, holding the baby in her arms. I was then about fifty yards from the house. I went out to the branch, placed my bonnet on a bush, put the fire which I carried in my hand under the pot, and immediately thereafter I heard my sister screaming.}

Mrs. O'Donnell, on leaving the house, said to me: "Take good care of the baby, the train is coming." I carried the baby into the kitchen, the rear room of the house and one furthest from the railroad, and put it down on the floor and commenced washing the dishes that had been used at breakfast. While I was washing the dishes Finegan, the fireman of the engine, brought the child to the room where I was. I said to Finegan, "Whose child is that?" He replied, "Yours." I said, "What is the matter with it; is it dead?" He said, "No, it only has its arm cut off; the engine run over it." I began to scream for my sister; she came. I ran out to the train and asked the train men to come and help us; it was not more than four or five minutes after I put the child down in the kitchen until Finegan brought it in the house. When the train stopped, the engine had not quite reached opposite the corner of the house. After Mrs. O'Donnell came to the house, she wrapped the child up in a sheet; a caboose attached to the train was pulled up opposite the door, }

I returned to the section house in company with Mrs. McKenzie. Upon reaching the house, at the suggestion of Mrs. McKenzie, we went out to look for the baby's track. We tracked the baby from the steps across the plank, over the ditch on to the track, and down the center of the track between the rails; between the last track and the blood, the ground seemed to have been disturbed within a few feet of where we found the blood on the rails, where the arm had been cut off. I looked on the outside of the track and along the side for the baby's tracks, and found none. There was no way for the baby to get on to the track except out of the door, down the steps and across the plank over the ditch. The track is perfectly straight for near a mile.

It got up and crawled upon the track; got upon its feet about twenty-five yards from the engine, and was clapping its hands when the engine struck it.

Have been so engaged for five years. Know that portion of defendant's road through Lyons' switch and by section house 59. The switch and section is about ten miles from Texarkana. West of the switch is a steep down-grade, and it is level through the switch to its east end; from thence up to the section house the grade rises, and for a considerable distance east of the house an engine and train going east generally runs through the switch without steam, the weight of the train carrying it through. Steam is let into the engine about the switch to carry her over the grade. It is about three hundred yards through the switch, and about two hundred yards from the east end to section house 59. The road runs due east and west, and is straight for about a mile, through the switch up to the section house. I was fireman on the train that injured plaintiff. Wm. Holmes was the engineer. It was No. 10, freight, on defendant's road, going east, from Marshall to Texarkana. We reached Lyons' switch on time, between 6 and 7 o'clock, on the morning of May 12, 1881. Did not}

On the day in question, the mother went down to a branch to wash. The branch was located about 200 yards from the house, and only a step from the railroad. When the mother left the house she told her sister, the child's aunt, to take care of the child as the train was coming. When the mother left, the aunt placed the child on the kitchen floor as she washed dishes. The railway company's fireman later brought the child into the house with its arm cut off by the train. The child filed a negligence action against the railway company. The railway company's engineer and its fireman both testified that they did not see the child on the track in time enough to stop the train. The railway company requested a jury charge that it owed no duty to persons on its track. The request was denied and the jury found in favor of the child. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that there was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the railway company's servants failed to discover the child in time because of their own want of proper watchfulness.}

The use of a railroad track, except where a highway crosses it, is exclusively the right of the railroad company which owns it, and the company and its employees are under no obligation to anticipate that children will be sitting or playing on the track. The company owes to persons so on its track no duty except the negative one, not maliciously, or with gross and reckless carelessness, to run over or otherwise injure them. Persons have no right, themselves, or to allow their infant children, to go on the track for their own amusement. 126 Mass., 377; 125 Mass., 75; 41 N. Y., 525; R. R. Co. v.

It is urged that the evidence of these witnesses must control the case; that the jury were bound not to disregard it. There seems to be no doubt that each of these men, after they discovered the child on the track, acted promptly and bravely in making every effort to save it, which either duty or manhood could require.

There is evidence of statements by each of these witnesses, inconsistent with material parts of their testimony. Finegan, the fireman, says he first saw the child crawling up on the ties, and at the same time he says Holmes, the engineer, had also discovered it. Holmes says he only recognized it as a child when about sixty yards distant. Finegan denies that he was at the time firing up the engine, or that he had told Mrs. O'Donnell that he was firing up or he could have seen the child. Mrs. O'Donnell testifies that he did tell her that he was firing up at the time or he would have seen the child sooner. Holmes says he first saw it close to, but off of the track, and supposed it to be a hog or pig. Dr. Rooks testifies to his recollection and impression that Holmes told him he first saw the child on the track, and thought it was a hog or bunch of rags. Holmes denied saying this, but says he might have said}

There is quite an improbability about the statement of Holmes that the child was in the ditch, and crawled out of it on the track. Whether he meant it or not, he is made to say that the child, when he first saw it, was in the ditch. The evidence is that the ditch was two feet deep, and it seems improbable that this child of eighteen months crawled out of a ditch of that depth as described. The inference from the evidence of Holmes and Finegan, taken in connection, is that nothing was seen until after the train, traveling at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour, had passed the east end of a switch two hundred yards from the house, and not more than one hundred and seventy or one hundred and eighty yards from where the child was hurt, and still less from }

Indeed, according to the testimony of its aunt, but four or five minutes had elapsed after the child was in the house until it was brought to her after the injury, and the entire time seems short enough to have fully occupied the child in making its way from the house, down the steps, across the plank walk, and then down the track, in the direction its mother had gone, to where it was run over on that track. Its footsteps were plainly traced down the center of the railway track, twenty or twenty-five yards, to within a few feet of where the blood showed the accident to have happened. No tracks were found outside or in the ditch. If, in view of these circumstances, and the testimony tending to show contradictory statements by the fireman and engineer, and especially of the fact that there was nothing to prevent them from seeing along and on the track, which was straight, and the view wholly unobstructed, the jury believed that the failure sooner to discover the child was }

Under these circumstances, great care was due on the part of the mother. But without expressing any opinion whether the contributory negligence of the mother should be imputed to a child of such tender years as the plaintiff, I however think that the judgment should be reversed on other grounds.}

It cannot be questioned but that the plaintiff was wrongfully on the track, a fact which the employees on the train were not bound to anticipate would happen, further than to use ordinary care to discover possible danger. The train was running at a reasonable rate of speed. The only eye-witnesses to the fact, the engineer and fireman, swore positively that they were at their post of duty and on the lookout, and that as soon as they saw the danger they used extraordinary}

The circumstantial evidence does not necessarily conflict with their positive testimony, which, under the circumstances, should be entitled to very great weight. The evidence shows that the child's tracks were obliterated at the place where the engine came in contact with her. In cases where there is a great preponderance of evidence against the verdict, I do not understand the true rule to be that the verdict should be upheld because, perchance, there might be some evidence upon which the jury might have found; but that the testimony to support the verdict should be so reasonably certain and sufficient as to show that the jury did not err.}
