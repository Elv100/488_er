Background,Verdict
"The deceased employee, Ben Lewis, worked for A. A. Greer as a plastering contractor and was engaged in tasks such as carrying plaster to workmen and moving equipment. On December 15, 1944, while carrying a mortar board up a stairway, he received a blow to the stomach, which caused immediate pain in his lower abdomen. Despite finishing his day's work, he did not return to work after that day and died on January 2, 1945. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was an appendiceal abscess.

The appellant, Lewis’s widow, initiated a suit to set aside an award of the Industrial Accident Board and to recover compensation benefits, asserting that Lewis's death was causally related to the blow he sustained at work. The jury found that the injury did not ""naturally result"" in Lewis’s death and that his death was not caused solely by disease. Lewis’s widow contended that the trial court erred by presenting two specific questions to the jury and argued that the jury's verdict was inconsistent.

The appellant's arguments included claims that:
1. There was an irreconcilable conflict in the jury's findings as the record presented only two alternatives: death caused in part by injury or death caused solely by disease.
2. The term ""naturally resulted"" was ill-defined and precluded the notion that there could be more than one cause of death. Furthermore, the given definition required the jury, if answering affirmatively, to state that the accident was the sole proximate cause of death.
3. The trial court's instruction regarding ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" excluded consideration by the jury of death from an injury that may have aggravated or accelerated a pre-existing disease.
4. The trial court made various errors in deciding what evidence was admissible, particularly in relation to medical records and expert testimony.
5. Errors in the court striking parts of hypothetical questions addressed to medical experts.

The insurer, appellee, denied that Lewis received accidental injuries within the scope of his employment, claiming that his death resulted from natural causes unrelated to his employment.","The court will uphold the judgment in favor of the insurer. It will affirm that the claimant's charge of the irreconcilable conflict is refuted by the finding that the injury did not naturally result in death. This finding alone will necessitate a verdict for the insurer, while the finding that Lewis's death was not caused solely by disease does not permit the claimant to recover without a causal connection between the injury and the death. The jury's findings, when considered together, provide a reasonable explanation that does not reflect an irreconcilable conflict.

Furthermore, the court will dismiss the concerns regarding the trial court's charge about the injury naturally resulting in Lewis's death. The court will conclude that the objection to the charge made by the appellant was not preserved for review as it was not raised before the verdict and judgment were delivered.

As for the evidentiary issues pointed out by the appellant, the court will determine that any potential errors were harmless as the jury found Lewis sustained an injury. The details that were excluded or limited during the trial were either cumulative of previously admitted evidence or not demonstrated to have substantially affected the trial's outcome.

Accordingly, the appellant's points of error concerning the jury's findings, the trial court's charge definitions, and decisions on the admissibility of evidence will be overruled. The initial trial court's judgment in favor of the insurer will be affirmed without the necessity for a new trial. The jury's answers and findings will be considered coherent and supportive of the judgment when construed as a whole, despite the efforts of the appellant to illustrate inconsistencies.

In conclusion, for the appellant to have been successful in her appeal, she would have needed to demonstrate that the jury's findings were irreconcilable or that the trial court's errors were sufficiently harmful to warrant a new trial. However, the appeal will fail on both accounts and the insurer will emerge victorious in the case."
"Marcos Rios was employed by A Guardian Angel Child Care Center, Inc. (the ""Appellant"") as a van driver whose job was to transport children to and from the daycare center. On January 28, 2013, Rios was exposed to fumes from a fire extinguisher that accidentally discharged in the vehicle. Following this incident, Rios began experiencing respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, a scratchy throat, and ultimately respiratory failure, leading to Rios requiring a permanent tracheostomy. Rios subsequently sued his employer for negligence, claiming that the facility's failure to properly secure the fire extinguisher, lack of employee training, and provision of an unsafe workplace caused his injuries. At trial, Rios provided lay testimony about the accident and his resultant symptoms, but did not present expert medical testimony explicitly linking his medical conditions to the fire extinguisher incident. He also introduced his medical records and bills, attributing the entirety of his medical expenses to the incident without segregating charges for respiratory care from other treatments. Rios won at trial, with the jury awarding him damages that included full compensation for past medical expenses, mental anguish, disfigurement, lost earnings, and lost earning capacity.","The appellate court reversed the trial court’s judgment and concluded that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that the fire extinguisher incident caused all of Rios’s claimed medical expenses. Expert medical testimony was necessary to establish proximate causation for many of the medical conditions and treatments, particularly since Rios was diagnosed with and treated for multiple chronic health conditions unrelated to respiratory issues. The court looked favorably upon the evidence relating to the time period between January 28, 2013, and February 28, 2013, during which Rios received treatment for his respiratory problems, assessing that only those conditions commonly known to relate to respiratory distress could be causally linked to the incident based on lay testimony. The court also noted that Rios's medical records did not segregate charges directly caused by the fire extinguisher incident from charges for other treatments or illnesses. As a result, it was nearly impossible for a jury to accurately determine which medical expenses were directly tied to Rios's respiratory issues resulting from the fire extinguisher exposure. Therefore, while the lay testimony supported some damages, the absence of expert medical testimony rendered the lay testimony legally insufficient to support the full amount awarded by the jury for past medical expenses.

Given that there was evidence to support some damages, the court indicated that Rios should be given another opportunity to develop the evidence further through a new trial on both liability and damages. A new trial on both liability and damages was deemed necessary due to the contested liability issues in the case. Thus, the court remanded for a new trial consistent with their opinion."
"Judith Weathersby sued Dr. Rex M. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association to recover damages for injuries she claims to have sustained as a result of alleged negligence during a post-hire physical examination. After being hired by ACS Industries, Inc., Weathersby underwent her employer-mandated physical examination conducted by Dr. Crago at MacGregor, a professional association of physicians. The examination included various tests, and during a Dynatron test—an evaluation of physical strength requiring the patient to pull upwards on a stationary bar—Weathersby strained her back.

Weathersby's lawsuit alleges that Dr. Crago’s negligence in administering the Dynatron test resulted in a spine compression fracture. However, Dr. Crago and MacGregor countered the allegations by moving for summary judgment on the basis that Weathersby’s claim fell under medical negligence, requiring her to prove duty, a breach of the standard of care, injury, and that the breach proximately caused the injury. 

According to the defendants, Dr. Crago complied with the standard of care, owed Weathersby no duty, and did not cause her injuries. Dr. Crago noted that x-rays taken the day after the test did not reveal a compression fracture but diagnosed her with a muscle spasm. He further testified regarding his compliance with the standard of care and argued that the injuries were not proximately caused by his treatment. He additionally supported his defense by pointing out that hundreds of other patients had taken the Dynatron test without injury before and after Weathersby's test.

The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and Weathersby appealed claiming that the trial court erred because the summary judgment addressed a medical malpractice claim rather than a claim of ordinary negligence.","The court will affirm the summary judgment for Dr. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association due to the appellants' failure to prove proximate cause. The defendants negated the essential proximate cause element, which consists of cause in fact and foreseeability. Dr. Crago successfully presented undisputed evidence negating cause in fact by testifying that the treatment did not cause or contribute to Weathersby’s alleged injuries or damages. Specifically, he referenced Weathersby's medical questionnaire and her current medical conditions, asserting complications developed independently of the Dynatron test. As for foreseeability, Dr. Crago’s expert affidavit negated this prong, attesting to the safety and appropriateness of the test, the lack of previous injuries during similar tests, Weathersby’s absence of back trouble, and the passive nature of the exercise, which rendered her injuries unforeseeable. 

Since Dr. Crago and MacGregor disproved both elements of proximate cause (cause in fact and foreseeability) and as the plaintiff did not respond with a controverting affidavit under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c), the court will determine that Weathersby failed to create a fact issue on proximate cause, leading to the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of Dr. Crago or MacGregor. Therefore, Weathersby's points of error will be overruled and the trial court judgment will be affirmed."
"J. P. Nenney, Jr., a flagman employed by the appellant company, Texas Traction Company, suffered injuries in December of 1912 due to an accident involving an express car. The incident occurred while Nenney was working on a gravel train, fulfilling his duties to navigate a switch at Kirkland’s Switch to allow the passing of other trains. Due to what the widow and minor child of Nenney allege were the negligence of the company’s employees in charge of the express car, Nenney had to jump from a motor car to avoid a collision, resulting in injuries. The company’s employees allegedly operated the express car at a high and excessive rate of speed, failed to control the car when approaching a switch, and failed to keep a proper lookout. Nenney, who was injured about his hips and stomach, became bedridden for several weeks but managed to partially recover, using support tools like a stick and crutches. However, in February following his accident, Nenney contracted grippe (influenza), and later tuberculosis, leading to his death. 

An ""Amended Plea in Intervention"" was filed by Nenney's widow and parents on behalf of herself and their minor child. It was claimed Nenney's injuries not only caused physical and mental pain and incurred medical expenses, but also weakened his resistance to disease, leading to his death from tuberculosis. The company argued the collision was a result of Nenney's failure to perform his duties, negating its liability, and sought a peremptory instruction for a judgment in its favor. Among other evidence, Nenney's pre-death deposition and the testimonies of physicians were presented, wherein it was ascertained that Nenney had mostly recovered from the accident's injuries before contracting grippe and tuberculosis. The jury found in favor of the appellees, the widow and child, awarding them damages for Nenney's death, which they determined to be the proximate cause of the accident. The company’s request for a peremptory instruction was denied by the lower court, resulting in the current appeal.","Given the evidence, it is likely the court will reverse the lower court judgment and remand the cause for a new trial. Even if Nenney was negligent, it will be argued that the company's employees also had the last clear chance to avoid the accident but failed to do so. However, the key issue will be the proximate cause of Nenney's death. Despite the argument that the injuries weakened Nenney's system, rendering him more susceptible to disease, the court will likely find that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the accident injuries were the proximate cause of Nenney's death from tuberculosis.

Physician testimony suggested that Nenney had largely recovered from his injuries when he later contracted grippe, an illness common during the time, and subsequently tuberculosis. According to medical opinions, though the injuries might have reduced Nenney's ability to resist disease, this debilitated condition was not shown to have led directly to the bacterial infection. Instead, it was a subsequent, separate ailment—grippe—followed by the contraction of tuberculosis that proximately caused his death. While the physical injuries were severe and resulted in suffering, they were not shown to be the direct cause of the infection. 

Therefore, in anticipation of the decision, the court will likely note that a proximate cause of death must be a consequence that a reasonably prudent person would foresee as a result of the conduct in question. Given the lack of clear evidence tying the accident directly to the death and the possibility of other intervening causes such as grippe, the court will likely determine that the injuries were not the natural and probable cause. However, it will likely not warrant a peremptory instruction and a direct ruling in favor of the company since the appeal is based on the rejection of such an instruction and other grounds for recovery may still be legitimate. Instead, the case will be sent back for reconsideration and a new trial, focusing on the correct grounds for determination of damages."
"Carol Peeler, the appellant, was an officer at Hillcrest Equities, Inc., a corporation that traded in securities. She and other Hillcrest principals were under federal criminal investigation by the IRS for various offenses. Peeler hired the appellees, attorney Darrell Jordan, and the Hughes & Luce law firm, where Jordan was a partner, and paid a substantial retainer fee. An assistant U.S. Attorney overseeing the investigation offered Peeler transactional immunity in exchange for cooperation, but Jordan did not communicate this offer to Peeler nor respond to the assistant U.S. Attorney. Peeler contends that Jordan's loyalty to other defendants was why the immunity offer was not relayed to her.

Later, a federal grand jury indicted Peeler and others for various offenses, and another suspect who accepted immunity provided information used to prosecute the rest, including Peeler. She pleaded guilty to aiding the preparation of a fraudulent U.S. partnership tax return and was sentenced to probation and a fine. Peeler claimed she entered the guilty plea on the advice of Hughes & Luce lawyers and discovered the immunity offer three days after her plea. Asserting that the failure to communicate the immunity offer caused her indictment and conviction, she sued for damages citing negligence, gross negligence, and a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), as well as breach of contract and breach of implied warranty.

The appellees moved for summary judgment on several grounds, arguing that Peeler would not have received immunity, the offer was unauthorized, for policy reasons her own conduct was the cause of her indictment and conviction, and that Peeler did not seek to withdraw her plea or set aside the conviction. The court ruled in favor of appellees based on policy reasons and the fact that Peeler had not sought postconviction relief prior to the hearing on summary judgment. Peeler's actions were seen as the proximate cause of her injuries, nullifying the alleged malpractice by the appellees. The court dismissed her claims against her defense team and she did not win the breach of contract claim in trial court.

After the judgment, Peeler filed a motion to vacate the judgment on her guilty plea in federal court. On appeal, her grievances included that her conduct was not the exclusive cause of her indictment and conviction; no policy barred her claim; and that innocence or remedy exhaustion were not prerequisites. She also argued that the judgment violated equal protection rights, Texas's open courts provision, and the ""outlawry"" provision of the Texas Constitution.","The court's future prediction is that it will uphold the summary judgment in favor of the appellees because Peeler cannot establish causation for her malpractice claims until she proves her innocence of the tax fraud charges. The rationale will be that Texas policy and decisions from various state courts emphasize that public policy does not support allowing a criminal defendant to profit from legal malpractice actions without proving their innocence first. This policy rationale is tied to the proposition that a criminal's own actions are the natural and primary cause of any legal consequences they face, including indictments and convictions. Therefore, without establishing her innocence, Peeler cannot convincingly argue that her attorney's failure to communicate an immunity offer was the proximate or producing cause of her damages, as per the usual criteria for legal malpractice cases.

Verdict reasoning would detail that neither negligence nor DTPA claims will stand because the appellant will be unable to demonstrate that her attorney's actions were the proximate (in negligence claims) or producing (in DTPA claims) cause of her damages. The court will reason that requiring proof of innocence or postconviction relief before allowing a malpractice claim against a criminal defense attorney aligns with long-standing legal principles and public policy aimed at preventing financial gain from one’s criminal activity.

The verdict will further clarify that the summary judgment does not violate Peeler's right to equal protection, as she, a criminal defendant, does not belong to a suspect class and the judgment is logically connected to the objectives of the legal system. The judgment also does not breach Texas constitution’s open courts provision since it does not stem from any statutory infringement on a common-law cause of action. Lastly, Peeler’s argument that she is being treated as an outlaw will be dismissed since the judgment does not prevent her from proving her innocence or seeking relief through other legal means; it simply follows policy that prohibits economic benefits from one’s crime for malpractice claims. Therefore, the court's expected determination would be an affirmation of the summary judgment in favor of the law firm and partner, upholding their motion on policy grounds associated with causation, while disregarding other potential grounds for summary judgment."
"Francisca Olivares, the plaintiff pedestrian, filed a personal injury action against the San Antonio Public Service Company, the defendant utility. The plaintiff alleged that while she was walking along a public street on the outskirts of the City of San Antonio, during or shortly following an unprecedented rain and electric storm, three overhead electric light wires owned by the defendant fell to the ground due to the defendant's negligence, causing her to suffer a severe shock and serious bodily injuries. The plaintiff articulated several acts of negligence on the part of the defendant, including assertions that the insulation on the wires was faulty, the wires were too loosely strung, the defendant had failed to inspect the wires within a reasonable time, the wires were strung too low, and the defendant had failed to bury the wires.

The case was brought to trial, and the jury was tasked with determining the truth of these allegations. Each of the alleged acts of negligence was submitted as special issues to the jury, who found against the plaintiff on each count. The jury concluded that the wires fell as a result of lightning, that the plaintiff suffered no physical shock or damage due to the fallen wires, and therefore had not sustained any damages. The plaintiff acknowledged, by not challenging the jury findings, that there was sufficient testimony to support these conclusions.

During the trial, the issue of whether the defendant was negligent for not having buried the wires was raised. An argument made by one of the defendant's counsel suggested that burying the wires would be very costly and would cause the utility to charge higher rates, which could have influenced the jury as some jurors were consumers of electricity provided by the defendant. The plaintiff objected to this argument, but the objection was overruled with the court stating that the argument was unlikely to have influenced the jury's specific findings regarding the lack of shock, damages, and the cause of the wires falling.

Furthermore, the plaintiff requested the trial judge to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which would infer negligence from the mere occurrence of the event, but the trial judge refused, given the jury's findings.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, denying the plaintiff, Francisca Olivares, any recovery. The verdict will be supported by the jury's specific findings, which effectively reject each of the plaintiff's allegations of negligence. Since the jury determined that the incident's occurrence, namely the falling of wires, was caused solely by lightning—a factor not under the control of the defendant utility—the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur will be declared inapplicable. Additionally, the jury's findings that the plaintiff did not suffer any physical shock or damages from the fallen wires mean that even if there was negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recovery without proven injury or damages.

The reasoning for the court's verdict will also address the objections raised by the plaintiff regarding the allegedly prejudicial comments made by the defendant's counsel. The court will determine that even if the counsel's arguments concerning the cost of burying the wires and the difficulty in procuring witnesses were improper, they were ultimately harmless given that they did not likely influence the jury's decision based on the context of the full jury findings.

Therefore, the court's ruling will center on the jury's determinations which did not find the utility's negligence nor damages to the plaintiff, rendering the plaintiff's objections and requests for reconsideration moot and leading to the affirmation of the judgment by the appellate court."
"The appellant, a property owner, sought review after the District Court of Travis County (Texas) ruled in favor of the City, sustaining demurrers (objections) and granting judgment for the City in a case where the property owner sought to recover damages. These damages were claimed for injuries and deaths of his livestock, which were said to be caused by mud banks and stagnant water. The water levels in the river adjacent to the owner's property had been lowered during the construction of a dam by the city, resulting in the formation of these dangerous conditions. The owner claimed that several of his horses died after getting mired in the mud, and others were injured or died from the effects after being rescued.

The appellant sought recovery for the value of the horses that died, the deterioration in value of the horses that were injured, and the expenses incurred in efforts to protect the animals from the hazard, treat their injuries, and feed them. The petition including these claims had paragraphs (12th and 13th) and a trial amendment detailing the damages, which were questioned on the grounds of certainty, remoteness, and ownership of the feed provided to the livestock. Demurrers to these concerns were sustained by the lower court, prompting the property owner to appeal the decision.","On appeal, it is anticipated that the court will reverse the decision of the lower court, finding that the city is liable for the damages sustained by the property owner's livestock due to the formation of mud banks as a natural and probable consequence of the city's actions. The reasonable expenses incurred in guarding the stock, moving them to safety, and returning them, as well as efforts to treat injured horses, will be acknowledged as recoverable damages. The court will likely reason that since the city's construction of the dam caused the hazardous mud banks, the property owner should not be precluded from using his property and protecting his livestock from danger. 

Furthermore, the court will opine that the owner has the right to engage in reasonable actions to safeguard his property from the dangers created by the wrongful acts of the city, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard should be covered. It is also projected that the court will hold the city liable for the difference between the expense and cost of keeping the livestock before the tort and the value of the hay and sorghum feed, if such expense was necessary and reasonable. Additionally, the court is expected to remand the case for a new trial to properly consider which specific damages are recoverable based on detailed and precise pleadings that avoid confusion around the number and condition of the horses affected, as well as to reconcile any inconsistencies in the amounts claimed. The court will encourage precision in establishing the recoverable damages, and only those that are proximate and not remote will be awarded. However, the court will not limit the property owner from pursuing the full measure of damages that naturally follow from the wrongful act, and will clarify that damages need not be foreseeable to be recoverable, as long as they are the natural and direct consequence of the wrongful act."
"Bock (appellee insureds) engaged in processing and cold storage of meats at their building in Galveston, dependent on electricity for refrigeration. On September 11, 1961, Hurricane Carla damaged electrical transmission lines five miles from Bock’s building, leading to a power outage that continued until September 14, 1961. This caused the temperature in Bock's cold storage vaults to rise and resulted in the loss of 10 to 15 percent of their meat, a financial loss of $2,418.36. Importantly, the hurricane did not directly damage Bock's building or refrigeration equipment. The insurers (appellant insurers) issued policies to Bock insuring against ""direct loss resulting from windstorm, hurricane."" They disputed the claim, arguing that Bock's meat spoilage did not constitute a ""direct loss"" under the policy.

At trial, the court found for Bock, deciding that the meat spoilage constituted a ""direct loss"" as stipulated in the insurance policy. The insurers appealed, contending the loss was not directly caused by the hurricane but was, instead, consequential.

Regarding Texas precedent, there were no cases precisely addressing ""direct loss"" under circumstances where the insured peril acted at a distance and upon uninsured property, yet ultimately led to loss at the insured's location. The court considered the terms of insurance contracts and the principle of proximate cause. The case referenced several previous Texas decisions, definitions, and the concept of foreseeability in establishing proximate cause in insurance contexts. Notably, other cases and jurisdictions were considered but found to be factually distinguishable or not controlling.","The court will affirm the trial court's ruling that Bock’s spoilage of meat was a direct loss caused by the hurricane. Given the chain of events, where a hurricane damaged the transmission lines leading to a power outage and subsequent spoilage of meat, this sequence is seen as unbroken by any new or intervening cause and, thus, the hurricane is considered the proximate cause of the loss. Since Bock did not contribute to the damage and the spoilage was a direct result of the loss of power caused by the hurricane, the loss fits within the policy's definition of ""direct loss.""

The term ""direct loss"" will be interpreted broadly, in line with Texas's precedent of favoring a broad and common parlance understanding of policy terms, and construing ambiguities against the insurer. The proximate cause is defined as a cause which, in a natural and continuous sequence, leading to the loss, without which the loss would not have happened. The court will determine that foreseeability of the damage due to a power outage from the hurricane would reasonably be within the contemplation of the parties at the time of insuring the contents, especially perishable goods requiring refrigeration.

Therefore, the appellate court's position will likely reiterate that the chain of events starting with the hurricane and leading to the spoilage of meat constituted a ""direct loss"" as covered by the insurance policy, obligating the insurer to cover the resulting damages to Bock."
"The plaintiff, who held a grazing lease on one hundred acres of land owned by a Mrs. Carson, encountered a tragic loss on April 27 when six of his cows were found dead. They lay in a row over a sizzling wire that had fallen between two poles owned by the defendant, Shell Oil Company. One of these poles was situated near Carson No. 2, one of two oil wells owned by the defendant on the same land. While Carson No. 1 was still in production as of April 1963, Carson No. 2 had not been in operation. The jury found that the defendant's act of leaving the power line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well's disconnection amounted to negligence and was the proximate cause of the cattle’s deaths.

An account by the defendant’s Production Foreman for Archer County outlined the history of Carson No. 2: It was originally electrically operated from December 1951 until 1955 when a gas engine replaced the electricity. The original power lines remained despite the switch. Electric power was reintroduced in March 1959 once it became purchasable. The well was temporarily abandoned in December 1961, and although not plugged, it was officially abandoned with the Railroad Commission's approval on January 8, 1962. The casing remained in the well and electrical power was disconnected in a manner deemed safe and customary for temporary disconnections at a pumping unit installation.

There was consensus that a lightning bolt striking a phase of the power line during the night of April 26—which had a thunderstorm with lightning—caused the wire to burn, break loose, and fall. There was no evidence suggesting that lightning is more likely to strike a charged wire compared to a ""cold"" or inactive one. Additionally, there were no presented allegations of defective equipment, failure to conduct proper inspections, or violation of regulatory statutes by the defendant.

The plaintiff referred to Texas Power & Light Co. v. Culwell as a case precedent. However, that precedent stressed the feasibility and practicability of insulating wire to prevent the escape of electric current in case of contact with another object. This case, contrastingly, lacked evidence indicating that the defendant's actions or inactions constituted negligence. Moreover, no testimony contested the defense's claim that the power was disconnected in a secure and accepted fashion. Based on the lack of evidence pointing to any increased hazard following the cessation of activities at the well, a duty to act differently by the defendant was not established.","The verdict was that the plaintiff's loss of cattle could not be legally attributed to the defendant's negligence. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff from the trial court was overturned, and a new judgment was rendered for the defendant. This conclusion is reached because there was inadequate proof that the defendant's conduct—leaving the line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well was abandoned—created a hazard significantly greater than before the well's production ceased.

Furthermore, it was found that the defendant's method of disconnecting the electrical power, considered safe and industry standard, was not challenged by any credible evidence that suggested an alternative practice should have been employed. Since the occurrence of lightning striking the wire was unforeseeable, and in the absence of proof that a charged wire posed a greater risk than an inactive one, there was no basis for a foreseeable risk that could have been averted by the defendant.

The court aligned with previous cases determining that without evidence demonstrating an increased danger due to the charged wire, no duty or negligence can be established, and the occurrence of an accident alone does not constitute liability if the consequences were not reasonably foreseeable. As a result, the defendant was found not liable as there was no established negligence or proximate cause linking their action or inaction to the tragic incident involving the plaintiff’s cattle."
"A products liability case was brought to court involving plaintiff turkey grower and defendant feed supplier. The defendant sold and delivered turkey feed under the brand ""Master Mix"" to the plaintiff, with the expectation that the feed would be used to feed approximately 250,000 turkeys during the year 1963. The grower added nothing to the feed except for mixing it with milo according to the defendant's specific instructions. The defendant financed all turkey feed, poults, and medication and supported the feeding process with expert visits and inspections. 

After the feed was distributed to various locations over central Texas, the plaintiff's turkeys, which were consuming the Master Mix feed, began to exhibit signs of illness, such as loss of color, becoming ""droopy,"" and when dressed, emitting an unusual sour odor. These symptoms appeared simultaneously across diverse geographic areas among flocks that had only the feeding of Master Mix in common. The plaintiff sought the expertise of several professionals, who did not find disease to be the cause but recommended changing the feed. An experiment was conducted, where one group of turkeys was fed a competitive company's feed and displayed rapid improvement over the group that continued on Master Mix. The defendant's representative had expressed concerns about the performance of the turkeys. 

Numerous experts, both for the plaintiff and defendant, gave testimony regarding the turkeys' health, with diagnoses ranging from mycosis and bacterial infection to copper poisoning from Ema-sol, a product used in their water. Through these deliberations, the jury found that the Master Mix feed, containing 8.5% to 20% cottonseed meal, was harmful to the turkeys and it was the producing cause of the damages sustained. The defendant appealed, citing various points of error, including contractual disclaimers of warranty and effectiveness, and strict liability considerations.","The court affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff, concluding that the evidence provided, both direct and circumstantial, was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that the harm to the turkeys was a direct result of the cottonseed meal content in the Master Mix feed supplied by the defendant. The court upheld the rule of strict liability imposed on vendors of food products and dismissed the effectiveness of disclaimers on feed contracts that attempted to waive or limit liability. These contractual terms do not mitigate the vendor’s strict liability in the event harm is caused by the product unfit for its intended purpose. 

Furthermore, the court determined that the disclaimer on the back of the contract was ineffective. Citing the case of Vandermark v. Ford Motor Company and Linn v. Radio Center Delicatessen, the court maintained that waivers that deviate from public policy by releasing manufacturers from strict liability for delivering unwholesome food products are invalid. Additionally, the sale of unfit feed also violated Texas Commercial Feed Control Act of 1957, which set standards for feed production, and any anticipatory release or waiver for violations of such a penal statute is universally held to be void. 

Based on the detail and correlation of the evidence across numerous witnesses and expert testimonies, the jury's findings concerning the specific damages and causes were upheld as they were not against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Damages were calculated in detail and supported by the plaintiff's profit and loss statements, bank statements, industry growth charts, and other documents, which indicated the financial significance of the turkeys' weight loss and failed growth. Interest was awarded from January 15, 1964, which aligns with the rationale of providing complete indemnity for the injured party, and the jury's verdict was not deemed excessive given the detailed nature of the evidence provided for each component of the damage award.

The judgment against the defendant feed supplier was a product of thorough and corroborated evidence that pointed to the feed's harmful cottonseed meal content as the primary cause of the plaintiff turkey grower's damages, affirming the rule of strict liability."
"On February 2, 2007, Geoffrey Dugger went to Joel Martinez's house. Martinez put ""cheese"" (black-tar heroin and Tylenol PM) in his pocket, and they later purchased tequila and a cigar, filled it with marijuana to make a ""blunt,"" and returned to Dugger’s residence. They consumed tequila, snorted cheese, and smoked marijuana. Martinez fell asleep, began vomiting, and made choking sounds. Dugger yelled for his parents but did not call 911 immediately. Instead, Dugger contacted Martinez's mother, Mary Ann Arredondo, telling her that Martinez had been drinking and was vomiting; she suggested letting him sleep it off. Fifteen minutes later, Dugger's father called 911. Despite emergency services' efforts, Martinez died. The police and paramedics were not informed of the heroin ingestion. Arredondo sued Dugger for wrongful death, claiming negligence due to the delay in calling 911 and not revealing the heroin use. Dugger asserted the common law ""unlawful acts doctrine,"" which traditionally barred a plaintiff's recovery if engaged in an illegal act contributing to their injury, as an affirmative defense. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dugger. The court of appeals reversed, stating that the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 93.001 superseded the common law doctrine. The Supreme Court of Texas reviewed the continued applicability of the unlawful acts doctrine given the state's proportionate responsibility scheme and § 93.001, which provides an affirmative defense for civil actions regarding personal injury or death when the plaintiff was committing a felony leading to final conviction and such felony was the sole cause of damages, or when the plaintiff was committing or attempting suicide.","The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. It held that the common law ""unlawful acts doctrine"" does not coexist with the proportionate responsibility scheme under Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which suggests that a plaintiff's unlawful conduct, not covered by an expressly stated statutory affirmative defense, should be apportioned rather than bars recovery completely. The court interpreted that the statute § 93.001 reinstates a limited portion of the unlawful acts doctrine to bar recovery solely under specific circumstances articulated within the statute – when there is a final felony conviction or commission/attempt of suicide attributable solely to cause the plaintiff's damages. The adoption of this proportionate responsibility framework has supplanted former doctrines, including the unlawful acts doctrine, as a complete bar to recovery. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was incorrect in applying the unlawful acts doctrine to grant summary judgment for Dugger. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

"The appellant in this case is an electric company, while the appellee is a landowner. On May 24, 1931, a high tension wire belonging to the electric company broke and fell on the landowner's property, igniting a fire. The landowner, a widow who managed her farm, attempted to extinguish the fire and, in doing so, received several electric shocks, causing personal injury. She was unfamiliar with electricity and its hazards. Her fences, which were composed of wire, became electrified due to being connected with the fallen power line.

The landowner filed a personal injury lawsuit against the electric company, alleging negligence. The jury found in her favor, concluding that the electric company had not taken proper precautions, such as grounding the wires of the fence under its power line and failing to maintain a circuit breaker that would cut off the current when the transmission line broke. The case hinged on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows a negligence claim to be made based on the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents. The appellant electric company argued that the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor and challenged the jury instructions regarding grounding the fences and the adjustment of the circuit breaker.

The jury found that the electric company's failure to have a properly adjusted circuit breaker and the lack of sufficient grounding constituted negligence and were proximate causes of the injuries. Furthermore, the jury determined that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, despite the company's argument that she should have known the danger after receiving shocks.","The court is expected to affirm the judgment of the trial court. The reason for this is that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, given that electricity is a force that requires a high standard of care and the types of accidents that occurred in this case generally do not happen absent negligence on part of the entity controlling it. Moreover, the evidence provided demonstrated that the electric company did not act with due care.

The burden of proof shifted to the electric company to demonstrate due care, but they failed to do so, evidenced by their lack of a properly functioning circuit breaker. Additionally, the mere fact that the electric current was discharged from a fallen wire and the landowner suffered injuries makes a prima facie case of negligence. The court will observe that the electric company did not ground the fence sufficiently and set the circuit breaker too high at 80 amperes despite knowing that a lower setting might have prevented the injury. 

Furthermore, the jury's assessment will likely be considered reasonable and not subject to disturbance by the higher court. These findings indicate the company’s negligence in protecting the public. The electric company's defenses about the landowner's contributory negligence are not sustainable because she lacked knowledge of the danger, and her actions were in response to an emergency. Additionally, the potential juror misconduct discussed by the appellant will likely be considered irrelevant as it transpired after the verdict was already established. Hence, the appeals court is expected to uphold the original judgment in favor of the appellee (the landowner)."
"James Watson was hospitalized at North Hills Hospital on February 23, 1995, for hip surgery, but his health deteriorated leading to further treatments at various facilities, including Transitional Hospital Corporation (THC) and Westpark Nursing Home. Six months later, in August 1995, he was admitted to Watson Memorial Nursing Home. By September 24, 1995, he had to be transported to Harris Methodist Hospital, where doctors observed his dire physical condition. The hospital suspected the neglect and abuse were due to the nursing home, triggering an investigation by the Texas Department of Human Services (TDHS). Watson died on October 2, 1995. 

Surviving children Donna Pack, Ann Bowling, and Linda Pearson filed a lawsuit against Crossroads Evangelism, Inc. d/b/a Watson Memorial Nursing Home and individual staff members, alleging negligence, negligence per se, gross negligence, wrongful death, and other claims, seeking damages under the Texas Survival Statute and the Wrongful Death Act. The jury returned a ""take nothing"" judgment in favor of Watson Memorial.

Appellants contested various trial court decisions on admissibility of evidence, discovery, expert testimony, and the striking of negligence per se claims. They argued for inclusion of TDHS records beyond those pertaining to Watson to show a pattern of neglect and contested the exclusion of Harris Methodist Hospital records and testimony from Dr. James Cox that might have implied Watson's condition resulted from neglect. They disagreed with the trial court’s refusal to release TDHS photographs of Watson and limitation of nurse Dolores Alford’s expert testimony. Appellants asserted the trial court erred in striking their negligence per se claims and contended that the evidence was factually insufficient to support a verdict for the defense. They also challenged the jury question formulation, which they believed should have included a question on Watson Memorial’s negligence leading to injuries not causing death, relevant to their survival claim.","The trial court's judgment was upheld. The appellate court reasoned that the limitation of TDHS records to those concerning Watson was within the court's discretion as other records did not constitute expert testimony and might have been overly prejudicial. Restrictions on the admissibility of Harris Methodist Hospital records and Dr. James Cox's testimony were deemed non-arbitrary as his conclusions on abuse or neglect were speculative, lacking a basis in fact specific to Watson's experience at the nursing home. The TDHS photographs were considered confidential and not subject to disclosure based on rulings that ""reports, records, and working papers,"" including photographs taken during investigations, were protected from public disclosure. Dolores Alford's qualifications were deemed insufficient to be considered an expert on standards of care, thus her testimony was limited. Negligence per se claims were correctly struck as the cited MLIIA and administrative code did not provide for tort liability in medical malpractice lawsuits. The jury's take nothing verdict was supported by evidence and not manifestly unjust. The trial court did not err in its jury question about negligence leading to death, as the wrongful death and survival actions arose from the same allegations and the evidence of causation was insufficient to support a verdict in favor of the appellants on the survival claim. Moreover, the appellate court presumed in favor of broad-form submission of questions, seeing no reverse error in light thereof, and the totality of circumstances surrounding the charge itself. The appellants' issues were overruled in their entirety, and the take nothing judgment against them was affirmed."
"The case involves a buyer (plaintiff) suing the seller (defendant) for damages related to the sale and delivery of diseased cattle, which introduced Bang's disease to the buyer's previously healthy herd. According to the case, the defendant sold cattle to the plaintiff, which were infected with Bang's disease at the time of delivery. As a result, the disease spread to the cattle already owned by the plaintiff. The seller argued that some damages were caused by the condition of the buyer's premises, which purportedly harbored and facilitated the spread of the disease. However, the jury determined that the buyer's premises and cattle were free from disease until the infected cattle were delivered.

The original trial court's judgment favored the buyer and awarded damages based on the difference between the reasonable cash market value of the infected cows at the time of delivery and the price the buyer paid for the cows. Thus, the buyer was awarded $1,750 in damages. The seller submitted a special issue questioning if the seller's cows had Bang's disease and whether the buyer's cows were free from the disease before the purchase. The trial court, however, did not submit these issues to the jury as they were considered evidentiary toward the outcome, which was already determined.

The seller moved for a rehearing, arguing that the damages were not wholly proximately caused by the seller's fraud due to the plaintiff's premises contributing to the spread of Bang's disease. The seller maintained that without clarity on the proximate causes of damage, the buyer could not recover any damages, and therefore, the seller was entitled to judgment. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that since the disease was introduced by and spread from the defendant's cattle, all damages were proximately caused by the seller's fraud.","The court will overrule the motion for rehearing. Because the jury already ascertained the reasonable cash market value of the cows delivered by the seller as being $1,750—due to being infected with Bang's disease—the plaintiff will be entitled to the difference between this sum and what he paid for the cows, irrespective of other damages resulting from the spread of the disease. The argument that the plaintiff failed to show that all damage was proximately caused by the defendant's fraud will not be upheld due to the earlier jury finding that all the damage was proximately caused by the seller's fraudulent sale of diseased cattle. The seller's contention that a portion of the damages was due to the condition of the plaintiff's premises, which harbored the disease, will not relieve the seller from liability because it would be irrelevant unless the disease was already present, which was not the case.

The court will adhere to the notion that there may be multiple proximate causes for damages and that the initial introduction of the disease by the seller's cattle was a proximate cause for the harm to the buyer's herd. This means even if the condition of the buyer's premises contributed to the spread of the disease, it does not detract from the causative effect of the infected cattle sold by the seller. Moreover, the seller's effort to argue that the plaintiff owed a duty to exercise care to prevent or minimize damage will not be persuasive because it was the defendant's original fraudulent act that set forth the chain of events leading to damage.

In conclusion, the court will consider the plaintiff's lack of knowledge about the disease prior to the cattle sale and the defendant's full awareness and misrepresentation as primary in determining that the seller's actions were the proximate cause of the buyer's damages. The judgment rendered will support the buyer's entitlement to damages, and the seller's contentions raised in the motion for rehearing will be deemed without merit. Thus, the seller's motion for rehearing will be respectfully overruled."
"The personal injury action in question arises from an accident that occurred on the night of February 16, 1955, involving a car hitting a train during a switching procedure. David Duffy, an 18-year-old high school senior, was a passenger in a 1941 Chevrolet automobile driven by Irving A. Hoff when the vehicle collided with a train operated by the defendant Railroad at a crossing in north Dallas County. The train was blocking the crossing, with part of it sitting directly on the crossing, and the remainder, including a caboose, extending south of the crossing. There were no lights or signals to indicate the blocked crossing, the portion of the train on the crossing was unlit, and the accident happened after dark on a moonless night. The track ran north-south, and the crossing was at grade with Belt Line Road.

The jury answered several questions concerning the circumstances of the accident, finding that the railroad crossing was more than ordinarily dangerous during nighttime switching operations, and that the railroad should have known this. They found the railroad’s failure to have a signal device or a flagman or to provide flares a proximate cause of the collision, while also finding that Hoff's manner of driving, including excessive speed and failure to keep a proper lookout, was negligent but not the sole cause of the accident. Plaintiff David Duffy was found not negligent.

The jury awarded damages to David Duffy for physical pain, mental suffering, loss of capacity to work, and earn money in the amount of $50,000. They also awarded Martin Duffy, David's father, $1,500 for medical expenses incurred. The railroad was aware of both the permanent and temporary conditions at the crossing and the high volume of traffic that passed through the area, as evidenced by prior traffic counts and a request from the county for the installation of signal lights at the crossing.

The Railroad's contention during the trial was that the crossing, being at a right angle with no curves or angles, would not be considered extra-hazardous, and any collision would result from the driver's negligence or a passenger's failure to warn. However, evidence from several witnesses, including past near-accidents and the lack of visibility of the train at night, supported the description of the crossing as extra-hazardous. The crossing was reportedly blocked frequently for switching operations, and this particular night the road would have been cleared in ""three or four minutes.""

The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs (Duffy), but the Railroad appealed, and the court reversed the decision. The Duffy plaintiffs then filed a motion for rehearing.","The motion for rehearing is going to be vacated because there is sufficient evidence that the crossing where the accident occurred was more than ordinarily dangerous at the time of night when switching operations were performed. This presents a fact issue that should be left to the jury to decide.

The court on rehearing will find that the Railroad had constructive knowledge of the dangerous conditions at the crossing due to the regularity of trains blocking the road for switching operations at night and the Railroad receiving a letter from the County Traffic Engineer expressing concerns about the crossing. The Railroad's failure to take action despite this knowledge supports a negligence finding.

In reaching a decision, the court will observe that the volume of roadway traffic is a significant factor in the character and risk assessment of a railroad crossing, as demonstrated by the daily traffic counts presented in evidence. Additionally, the lack of moonlight on the night of the accident contributed to the crossing's hazardous status, compounded by the dark-colored boxcars that were not reflective, causing approaching headlights to shine under the train instead of illuminating it.

The switching operations at this crossing differed from typical railroad crossings because the train was frequently stopped at the crossing for the interchange of cars. Coupled with the testimony of the train crew and a history of incidents, these distinguishing elements indicated an extra-hazardous condition. Observations from residents who had experienced near-collisions due to poor visibility of the train at night further substantiated the jury's findings.

The damage award for David Duffy will be upheld as reasonable and not excessive given the severe and permanent injuries he sustained, which were duly considered by the jury. The court will also conclude that there was no evidence of jury misconduct affecting the verdict.

For these reasons, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment for the plaintiffs, upholding the jury's determination of the Railroad's negligence and the award of the damages to David Duffy and Martin Duffy. The Railroad's contention that they were due a peremptory instruction will be dismissed, as the evidence supports the jury's finding of extra-hazardous conditions and the Railroad's failure to adequately signal the crossing. The Railroad's failure to investigate conditions at the crossing after being notified of traffic concerns will also weigh heavily against them. 

The trial court's original judgment in favor of the father and son plaintiffs will stand, confirming the Railroad's knowledge of the dangerous crossing conditions and its negligence in failing to provide adequate warnings for motorists."
"Denise Castaneda sought damages from Provident American Insurance Company for alleged violations of the Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) due to the denial of her insurance claim. Denise was covered under a family insurance policy that her father, Guillermo Castaneda Sr., had purchased in May 1991. The policy contained two relevant limitations: that illnesses manifesting within 30 days from the policy's effective date were not covered, and diseases or disorders of specific internal organs, including the gallbladder, were excluded unless the loss occurred six months after the policy’s effective date. Denise and her brother exhibited yellow skin throughout their lives, and in July 1991, within 30 days of the policy taking effect, they were diagnosed with hereditary hemolytic spherocytosis (HS) which led to gallstones. Their claims were denied initially due to the six-month gallbladder exclusion but were later denied on the basis that HS had manifested within the 30-day waiting period. Multiple communication attempts were made by Denise's family and doctors to dispute the denial, all of which were denied or remained unacknowledged.","The court will reverse the appellate court's verdict on the grounds that the evidence presented was legally insufficient to support the findings that the insurance company had no reason to deny Denise Castaneda's claim, or that the insurer's liability was reasonably clear. The analysis will hinge upon the understanding that ""manifestation"" of an illness, relative to the policy's exemptions, does not necessarily mean that the insured had to be aware of the illness for it to manifest. Since both Denise and her brother had exhibited yellow skin and various symptoms before the healthcare policy was enacted, and given the details provided about the uncle's diagnosis within the 30-day period, there is a substantiated argument that HS manifested within the precluded window. Thus, it is predictable that a reasonable insurer could have decided to deny Denise's claims, especially considering the provided timelines and information available to the insurer at the time of denial. Furthermore, the testimony of Denise Castaneda, indicating she had been denied credit cards, is legally insufficient to support a claim for loss of credit reputation due to the absence of evidence proving that the denial of her claim directly resulted in injury or financial harm, such as the inability to obtain loans or incur higher interest rates. As there is no evidence of bad faith or other legal violations by the insurer, and with no findings of liability based on the theories submitted to the jury, the court will render judgment in favor of the insurer, indicating that Castaneda will not recover any damages."
"On October 22, 1963, Elma Gravis experienced abdominal pain, for which her husband, C. K. Gravis Jr., contacted Dr. Philip S. Joseph. Meeting at the emergency room of the Physicians & Surgeons Hospital of Alice, Texas, Mrs. Gravis received an examination and pain medication, followed by observation. Further examinations and tests were conducted, inclusive of X-rays and various medications, like sedatives, antibiotics, and pain relievers. On October 24, an emergency exploratory surgery was performed to address an intestinal obstruction, during which Mrs. Gravis received spinal anesthetic and pentothal sodium. Post-surgery, Mrs. Gravis developed permanent disabilities, including bladder issues, phlebitis of the left leg, and partial paralysis.

The Gravises sued on multiple grounds including assault and battery, fraud, duty to warn, breach of contract, administrative negligence, and various acts of negligence and malpractice. Following extensive discovery with depositions, affidavits, and other legal filings, the defendants each moved for summary judgment. The trial court held that based on the uncontroverted evidence, there was no material fact issue and thus granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment. Mrs. Gravis was the patient; Dr. Joseph was the operating physician; Dr. John C. Turnham Jr. was the assisting physician; and Ruth B. Grose was the nursing supervisor and anesthetist at the hospital.

The plaintiffs contested the summary judgment on two main points: failure to prove the absence of genuine issues of fact and improper judgment despite this alleged failure. However, during both the admission and the operation, Mrs. Gravis was heavily sedated. The evidence showed that Dr. Joseph sought and received verbal consent from Mr. Gravis for the emergency operation when Mrs. Gravis' condition deteriorated, and Mr. Gravis signed a written consent form. No objections to the operation were recorded from either Mr. or Mrs. Gravis, and the primary contention seemed to center on the specific anesthetic used, which medical evidence suggested was standard and posed an extremely rare risk.","The appellate court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. It will consider that the necessity for emergency surgery meant that informed consent was not required under the circumstances, as timely action was crucial. The notion of consent will be extended to Mr. Gravis, who agreed to the surgery under emergent conditions, and this consent will be judged to be legally sufficient. The verdict will rely on the professional medical opinions presented, which will testify that the emergency situation justified actions taken without prior express consent and that the anesthetics and medical practices employed were routine and carried negligible known risks.

The appeal will fail to prove that informed consent was necessary given the emergency nature of the surgery, which will be supported by professional standards and expectations of medical practice at the time. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' inability to present expert medical evidence linking the defendants' actions to Mrs. Gravis's injuries will be pivotal. The absence of such crucial expert testimony regarding the standard of care and proximate causation leaves no fact issue for a jury to resolve.

Therefore, the court will conclude that the plaintiffs have not met the burden of proof required in malpractice cases and that the defendants acted within the bounds of reasonable medical practice. The lack of evidence that any other physician acting under similar circumstances would have disclosed further information about the potential risks or would have acted differently will be instrumental in affirming the judgment. The verdict will clarify that an allergic reaction to anesthesia, while devastating, was unforeseeable and not a direct result of any negligence on the part of the medical staff."
"**  
The case revolves around a medical malpractice claim involving the death of Harold Guerra, following a cervical fusion surgery performed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr. John Halcomb on January 27, 2003. Post-surgery, Guerra was under the care of Nurse Melinda Quinonez LVN. Guerra's wife, Miguela ""Mickie,"" reported to the nursing staff that her husband felt anxious and was having breathing difficulties around 2:30 p.m., shortly after being moved to his hospital room. Contrasting testimonies emerged about the timing of the complaints, with Nurse Quinonez testifying that shortness of breath was not reported by Guerra or his family until 3:25 p.m. The patient continued to experience difficulties, and at 3:45 p.m., a respiratory code was called. Despite attempts by medical staff to intubate Guerra and an emergency tracheostomy performed around 4:05 p.m., he was deprived of oxygen for too long and succumbed to brain death, passing away eleven days later. A jury awarded the plaintiffs, Guerra's survivors, approximately $2.2 million, but the trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of the defendants, the hospital and nurse employees, based on the claimed insufficiency of evidence to support the jury's verdict regarding causation. The plaintiffs appealed this decision.

The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rested on expert testimony, particularly from Dr. David J. Cullen, who asserted that Guerra would not have died if Dr. Halcomb had been notified of the patient's complications at 2:30 p.m., or even as late as 2:45 p.m. Other medical experts and nurses involved corroborated the view that an earlier notification could have led to lifesaving interventions. The defendants argued that insufficient evidence was presented to establish a causal link between the hospital's actions and Guerra's death, emphasizing that none of the medical staff were able to explain why intubation attempts failed. They compared the case to Jea v. Cho, where the court rejected a series of ""ifs"" as evidence.

**","**  
The reviewing court will reverse the JNOV granted by the trial court and remand the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. The reasoning will be based on the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding causation, which allows a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that the hospital's negligence proximately caused Guerra's death. The court will credit Dr. Cullen's expert testimony that establishes a reasonable medical probability that an earlier call to Dr. Halcomb would have provided enough time for a successful intervention, and the hospital's failure to make the call was a substantial factor in bringing about the fatal outcome. The court will consider that the jury is entitled to believe Mickie's report over Nurse Quinonez's conflicting account and that jurors may choose to believe one witness over another. Furthermore, the hospital's foreseeability argument will be addressed, with Nurse Quinonez's testimony inferring that Guerra's death was a foreseeable consequence of not addressing his breathing difficulties sooner. The court will distinguish the present case from Jea v. Cho, noting that in the Guerra case, there was expert testimony specifically articulating a reasonable probability of causation. The hospital's analogy to Cho will fail as the court will not accept the argument that expert opinions regarding causation merely constitute a series of speculative ""ifs."" Instead, the court will find Dr. Cullen's testimony sufficient to support the jury's finding. This detailed analysis of the testimonies and evidence in favor of causation will lead to the conclusion that the evidence meets the standard required for legal sufficiency, necessitating the reversal of the JNOV and upholding the initial jury award."
"On May 31, 2016, a construction worker named Jose Camerino Maravilla was electrocuted and his coworker, John Paniagua, was injured while they were working on a home being constructed by Weekley Homes, LLC. Paniagua and Maravilla’s relatives (referred to collectively as ""appellants"") filed a lawsuit against Weekley and others, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and premises liability. The contention was that they were storing scaffolding on a wet concrete floor during a storm which led to their electrocution. The appellants claimed there were no warnings about the energized temporary power poles and lines that could cause the surface area to become energized due to nearby electrical poles.

Weekley Homes filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because Paniagua and Maravilla were employees of an independent contractor hired for framing and cornice work, Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code applied, thus absolving Weekley from liability unless certain conditions were met. Weekley claimed that they had no control over the manner in which work was performed and lacked knowledge of any dangerous condition.

Appellants contended that Weekley knew about the dangerous weather conditions and should not have told workers to move the scaffolding during the rain. They put forth that there was actual exercise of control by Weekley over the work conditions, as evidenced by instructions given by Weekley's representative on the site, Mr. Holmes.

The trial court initially granted Weekley’s motion for summary judgment, and subsequently, denials were made for appellants' motions for reconsideration and new trial, and for leave to designate experts late.","In evaluating the applicability of Chapter 95, even if all legal procedures were followed with the declarations, there's no definitive proof that the injuries originated from working on the very same improvement as stated under the Chapter. Hence, Weekley did not conclusively show that the Chapter 95 protections were applicable. Consequently, the trial court's granting of the traditional summary judgment based on Chapter 95 was erroneous.

Regarding the no-evidence summary judgment for negligence and premises liability claims, appellants presented more than a scintilla of evidence demonstrating a duty owed and the possibility of a nexus between their injuries and the control of their working conditions by Weekley. This includes Mr. Holmes's selection of the metal scaffolding, and his instruction to continue work through bad weather. Additionally, Longeway’s expert report provides crucial and new facts, which were not previously available or discoverable before the trial court's ruling, and is likely to produce a different result upon retrial. Consequently, the denial of appellants’ motion for reconsideration and new trial concerning negligence and premises liability claims was an abuse of discretion by the trial court.

However, appellants failed to provide substantive evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Weekley's actual, subjective awareness of risk—a required element for a gross negligence claim. Therefore, the trial court was correct in denying the motion for reconsideration and new trial in relation to the gross negligence claim.

Ultimately, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s verdict on the gross negligence claim, reversed the verdict on the negligence and premises liability claims, and remanded those parts back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion."
"William Nami, a railroad employee of Union Pacific Railroad (Union Pacific) for 32 years, contracted the West Nile virus from a mosquito bite and sued his employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (""FELA""), alleging that Union Pacific failed to provide a safe workplace. Nami operated a tamping machine in Brazoria County near Sweeny, known for its dense mosquito population, which increased following Hurricane Ike. The area surrounding the tracks where Nami worked was overgrown with weeds, high grass, and sometimes pools of water. Nami was frequently bitten by mosquitoes on the job, even inside the tamper, which had holes and a non-functioning air conditioner. Union Pacific knew about the risk that mosquitoes could carry the West Nile virus and had issued bulletins warning employees about the virus and recommending the use of mosquito repellent, though they did not provide repellent to employees.

Nami became ill with flu-like symptoms, which escalated and were later diagnosed as West Nile virus and encephalitis. His illness resulted in long-term health problems, preventing him from returning to work. Nami did not have prior knowledge of the bulletin or warnings from Union Pacific, was unaware of the risks of the West Nile virus, and did not take measures to prevent mosquito bites. At trial, a jury found both Union Pacific and Nami negligent, attributing 80% of the responsibility to Union Pacific and 20% to Nami, and awarded Nami $752,000 in damages.

Union Pacific appealed, invoking the common-law doctrine of ferae naturae, arguing that they owed no legal duty to protect against wild animals (mosquitoes in this case) indigenous to the property unless the landowner had attracted or controlled the animals, which they had not.","The verdict for the case will likely be that the doctrine of ferae naturae applies, which precludes railroad liability because Union Pacific did not attract or control the mosquitoes. The duty to provide a safe workplace does not extend to uncontrollable, indigenous wild animals unless the property owner has taken action to concentrate such animals on the property, has reduced them to possession, or knows of an unreasonable risk that can be mitigated or warned against. Since mosquitoes are indigenous to Texas, and there is no evidence that Union Pacific could have possibly attracted or controlled the mosquito population around its tracks or reduced the mosquitoes to possession, they had no duty to protect Nami from them.

In assessing foreseeability, while Union Pacific did issue a bulletin warning employees about the West Nile virus, which indicates some level of foreseeability, the risk of contracting it was relatively low, and less than 1% of cases develop serious illnesses. The mere presence of local mosquitoes, even in large numbers, does not itself indicate an unreasonable risk created by the employer, nor does it demonstrate that the employer's actions or inactions significantly exacerbated an existing natural risk. Moreover, Union Pacific's failure to mow the right-of-way or repair the tamper cab could not be definitively linked to creating an environment that attracted infected mosquitoes.

In light of these factors, the judgment of the lower court will likely be reversed, and a judgment rendered for Union Pacific, on the grounds that there was no breach of duty under FELA by Union Pacific when Nami contracted the West Nile virus. The application of the ferae naturae doctrine will be upheld, indicating that Union Pacific is not liable for Nami’s injuries contracted from indigenous wild animals that they did not attract or control on the property."
"The case involves an appellant cab company seeking to overturn a trial court decision in favor of an injured son (Ascencion Gomez Vasquez) and his father, based on the rescue doctrine. Ascencion was struck by one of the cab company's drivers while attempting to rescue a girl lying in the middle of the road after a one-car accident. According to the facts, at approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 20, 1966, Ascencion was en route to his job when he witnessed a white car speed by and crash into a utility pole. As he approached the scene, he noticed several people fleeing from the crashed vehicle and saw the girl in the road. Ascencion, in an effort to help, stopped his car and, while attempting to attract the attention of an approaching taxi by waving his arms and shouting, was hit by the cab, fracturing his leg near the knee.

The cab driver, Daniel Vera Auces, was accompanied by a passenger and claimed to be traveling at 25 mph. He stated that he saw Ascencion's parked car but did not notice Ascencion himself until just before the impact. After hitting Ascencion, Auces stopped the cab a short distance away. Subsequently, it was discovered that the girl in the street had also been run over by the taxicab but left the scene with her friend post-accident. 

During the trial, the jury found that Auces had been primarily negligent for failing to maintain a proper lookout, appropriately apply brakes, or control the taxi's speed under the circumstances of his approach to the scene. However, the jury also found that Ascencion did not move out of the way in time, contributing to the accident. The jury then found that Ascencion had exercised ordinary care while attempting to rescue the girl by waving and shouting. The appellees did not request a jury instruction on a lesser standard of care applicable in rescue attempts, and the trial court ruled in their favor, awarding damages for medical expenses and loss of contributions, as well as a significant sum for Ascencion's injury and consequent reduced earning capacity.

The rescue doctrine acknowledges a person's attempt to aid others in imminent danger, accounting for the elevated risks taken under such circumstances. Ascencion's actions were found by the jury to align with those of an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances during the rescue attempt.","The appellate court will focus on the reconcilability of the jury's findings to determine the cab company's liability. The court will establish that the findings of the jury are in direct conflict: on one hand, the jury found Ascencion was negligent for not moving aside, which under normal circumstances could justify a take-nothing judgment in favor of the cab company; on the other hand, the jury also found that he behaved as an ordinary prudent person during the rescue attempt, which would normally negate the contributory negligence and support the trial court's judgment in favor of Ascencion.

The critical verdict component will be the standard of care required during the rescue attempt. Although the heroes' actions typically transcend those of an ordinary prudent person, the legal standard must accommodate the inherent risks in a rescue, which may require actions not aligning with typical standards of self-care. The appellate court will dissect whether the lower standard of care, such as ""rash"" or ""reckless"" behavior, was properly applied to Ascencion's actions during the rescue attempt, according to the instructions given to the jury.

The court will scrutinize how the jury was directed to reconcile the higher risks assumed during a rescue with the standard of care expected from an ordinary prudent person, absent the rescue context. Since the jury was instructed to apply the same standard of care, the findings may be viewed as incompatible, leading the appellate court to reverse the trial court judgment for a fundamental inconsistency. The court will likely parse the intricacies of the rescue doctrine and its implications on a rescuer's standard of care, ultimately concluding that Ascencion should not face a higher bar for contributory negligence during a rescue attempt. 

However, considering that there was no formal pleading or specific finding to support the lowered care standard during a rescue, and the rescue doctrine itself anticipates negligence by the defendant that created the peril, but without a specific finding on that issue, there may be a technical inadequacy in applying the rescue doctrine to justify the trial court's judgment.

In conclusion, the appellate court's reasoning will likely be grounded in the irreconcilable jury findings about Ascencion's care during the rescue attempt versus his contributory negligence, necessitating a reversal of the trial court's ruling and a remand for further proceedings consistent with the proper standards and interpretations of the rescue doctrine."
"The case involves an appeal by the appellant insurance company, Great American Health and Life Insurance Company, against a judgment in favor of the appellee, R. L. Lothringer, who sued on behalf of his wife, the insured, to recover under an accident policy issued by the appellant. The 156th District Court of Bee County, Texas, had previously granted judgment to Lothringer, awarding $6,000.00 jointly and severally against both Great American and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company, which had succeeded to Great American's rights. The jury-less trial led to an appeal by Great American, which did not agree with the decision. There were no findings of facts or conclusions of law included in that decision. 

The second trial of this cause was a result of a former judgment for appellee that had been reversed and remanded by the 10th Court of Civil Appeals. The accident policy in question provided for payments based on a disability caused solely by accidental means. The insured, Maymie L. Lothringer, alleged that she sustained a disabling injury after an accidental fall. However, the appellant provided evidence that the insured had a pre-existing arthritic condition that contributed to her disability.

The appellant's basis for appeal included six points of error, primarily contending that appellee failed to prove that the injury was independent of all other causes, that the insured was totally and continuously disabled, that the injury required the personal care and attendance of a legally qualified physician, that there was no evidence of probative value to support the judgment, that there were errors in admitting certain evidence, and objection to the overruling of appellant's motions for continuance.

Evidence presented at trial included the insurance policy, testimony from Mrs. Lothringer about her fall, the resulting injury, and her ongoing pain and disability since the incident. Additionally, depositions from two doctors, Dr. Sol Foreman and Dr. William H. Ainsworth, were presented, both indicating that the disability was caused by a combination of the fall and the pre-existing osteoarthritis.","Considering the evidence provided, the court will likely conclude that the appellee’s disability was not solely caused by accidental means independent of all other causes. The court will probably find that the accident and the pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis in Mrs. Lothringer's knee concurrently contributed to the disability. This would mean that the disability was not exclusively a result of the accident, which contravenes the policy provision requiring the disability to result solely from accidental causes. 

The court will likely rely on precedents establishing that where a policy limits its coverage to injuries being the sole cause of disability, the evidence must demonstrate that the disability occurred independently of other causes. Since both medical experts' testimonies suggest a pre-existing condition significantly contributing to the insured's disability, the court will probably rule that Mrs. Lothringer's condition does not fall within the coverage terms of the insurance policy.

The verdict will probably reverse the judgment against Great American Health & Life Insurance Company based on the reasoning that the insured did not meet the policy's requirement to establish proof of disability solely from an accident. Moreover, because the rights of Great American Health and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company are interwoven, the judgment against the non-appealing co-defendant, Texas Reserve Life, will also likely be reversed. The predicted outcome will be a ruling in favor of the appellant insurance company, rendering that the appellee takes nothing against them."
