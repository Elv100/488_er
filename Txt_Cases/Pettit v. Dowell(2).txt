Case Summary \n  \n  \n Procedural Posture \n Appellant, physician, challenged the judgment of the 170th District Court of McLennan County, Texas, finding the physician 40 percent negligent on claims asserted under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Survival Statute by appellees, parents. \n Overview \n The parents' 21-year-old son was taken by police to a health center because he had self-inflicted wounds and was talking about committing suicide. The son was seen at the emergency room by the physician, who requested a psychological assessment. The son was evaluated, and it was determined that he was not "actively suicidal." The physician reached the same conclusion, and the son was discharged. The next day, the son hung himself. The physician argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the finding that the alleged breach of the applicable standard of care proximately caused the injury. The appellate court ruled that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding of causation. The physician asserted that because the evidence that the son was not actively suicidal when he was discharged from the emergency room was so overwhelming, the evidence was factually insufficient to support the proximate cause finding. The appellate court found that it could not say that the evidence supporting the jury's finding of causation was either weak or overwhelmed by the physician's contrary proof. \n Outcome \n The judgment was affirmed. \n Counsel: For APPELLANT/RELATOR: Alfred Mackenzie, HALEY DAVIS PC, Waco, TX. \n For APPELLEE/RESPONDENT: Vincent Lee Marable, ATTORNEY at LAW, Wharton, TX.; Jim Dunnam, DUNNAM & DUNNAM, LLP, Waco, TX.   \n Judges: Before Chief Justice Gray, Justice Vance, and Justice Reyna. (Chief Justice Gray dissenting).   \n Opinion by: BILL VANCE \n Opinion \n  \n  \n  \n MEMORANDUM OPINION  \n This is an appeal from an adverse judgment in a medical malpractice case. Because we find no error, we will affirm the judgment. \n  \n THE EVENTS \n Early on a Saturday, twenty-one-year-old Lance Dowell was taken by Freestone County Sheriff's Deputies to Providence Health Center in Waco (Providence) because he had self-inflicted wounds and was talking about committing suicide. He was seen at the emergency room by Dr. James C. Pettit, who requested a psychological assessment from the DePaul Center (DePaul), which is affiliated with Providence. Sister Mary Theresa Fox, a joint employee of Providence and DePaul, evaluated Lance's condition and determined that he was not "actively suicidal." Dr. Pettit reached the same conclusion. Lance was discharged from the hospital, accompanied by his mother, Carolyn Dowell (Carolyn). \n During that same [*2]  day, Lance went to his mother's home in Waco and bathed, went to Lake Limestone, went to Fairfield with his brother Larry to a rodeo, and visited with friends. On Sunday he and Larry attended a family reunion and made plans to meet at a party that night. On Sunday evening, Lance hung himself. \n  \n THE SUIT \n Lance's parents, Carolyn and Jimmy Dowell (Jimmy), sued Providence, DePaul, and Dr. Pettit, under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Survival Statute, asserting a claim of medical negligence and a claim under the federal "anti-dumping" statute. A jury found that Lance suffered personal harm as a direct result of Providence's failure to provide an appropriate psychiatric screening evaluation. After finding that the negligence of all three defendants proximately caused the injury in question, the jury apportioned the negligence 20% to Dr. Pettit, 40% to Providence, and 40% to DePaul. Damages were assessed as follows: $ 100,000 each to Carolyn and Jimmy for past mental anguish and loss of society and companionship; $ 100,000 each for the same elements in the future; and $ 400,000 for pain, mental anguish, and funeral and burial expenses as compensation for Lance. The court entered [*3]  a judgment accordingly. Dr. Pettit filed a notice of appeal, which we docketed under cause number 10-01-00420-CV. Providence and DePaul also filed a notice of appeal, which we docketed under cause number 10-02-00026-CV. The causes were submitted on the same day. \n The appeal was abated twice thereafter and finally reinstated on April 20, 2005, after the bankruptcy court granted limited relief from the automatic stay. \n  \n ISSUES IN THIS APPEAL \n Dr. Pettit asserts in seven issues: (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to support the finding that the alleged breach of the applicable standard of care proximately cause the injury; (2) the evidence is legally insufficient to support an award of damages for pain and mental anguish; (3) Jimmy and Carolyn, individually, are not entitled to recover damages under the survival statute; (4) a potential statutory beneficiary under the Wrongful Death Act is unaccounted for; (5) the evidence of causation is factually insufficient to support the finding; (6) the court erred in failing to ask the jury about Lance's negligence; and (7) the award of survival damages is excessive. 1  We will address the issues in the same order. \n  \n  [*4] STANDARD OF REVIEW \n We begin by considering the most recent articulation of the no-evidence review standards, address the factual sufficiency standards, then add the requirements peculiar to medical negligence cases. \n  \n LEGALLY-INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE REVIEW STANDARD \n A no-evidence issue must and can only be sustained when the record reveals: (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) rules of law or rules of evidence bar the appellate court from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; and (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact.  City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 48 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 848, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, at*11, 2005 WL 1366509, at *2 (Tex.  2005) (citing Calvert, "No Evidence" and "Insufficient Evidence" Points of Error, 38 TEX. L. REV. 361, 362-63 (1960)). \n After a lengthy review of the applicability of the standard in each of the four instances, the Court went on to say: "If the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions, then jurors must be [*5]  allowed to do so. A reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trier-of-fact, so long as the evidence falls within this zone of reasonable disagreement."  Id. 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436 at *49, [WL] at *10. \n  \n FACTUALLY-INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE REVIEW STANDARD \n When we review an "insufficient-evidence" issue challenging the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding that favors the party who had the burden of proof on that finding, we may set aside the finding only if a review of all the evidence, both for and against the finding, demonstrates that the finding is clearly wrong and unjust.  Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176, 29 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 214 (Tex. 1986);  Checker Bag Co. v. Washington, 27 S.W.3d 625, 633 (Tex. App.CWaco 2000, pet. denied). Reversal could occur because the finding was based on weak or insufficient evidence or because the proponent's proof, although adequate if taken alone, is overwhelmed by the opponent's contrary proof.  Checker Bag, 27 S.W.3d at 633 (citing William Powers, Jr. & Jack Ratliff, Another Look at "No Evidence" and "Insufficient Evidence,"  69 TEX. L. REV. 515, 519 n.11 (1991)). \n MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE REQUIREMENT \n  [*6]  In a medical-negligence case, the plaintiff is required to show evidence of a "reasonable medical probability" that the injury was proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant.  Park Place Hosp. v. Estate of Milo, 909 S.W.2d 508, 511, 39 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 70 (Tex. 1995);  Duff v. Yelin, 751 S.W.2d 175, 176, 31 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 401 (Tex. 1988). There are four elements to be proved: (1) a duty by the physician/nurse/hospital to act according to applicable standards of care; (2) a breach of the applicable standard of care; (3) an injury; and (4) a causal connection between the breach of care and the injury.  Cruz v. Paso Del Norte Medical Found., 44 S.W.3d 622, 629-30 (Tex. App.CEl Paso 2001, pet. denied). \n  \n ISSUE ONE \n  \n LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE OF CAUSATION \n Dr. Pettit's first issue attacks the legal sufficiency of the evidence of causation, focusing on the cause-in-fact element of proximate cause. He correctly cites Duff v. Yelin, where the Texas Supreme Court upheld an instructed verdict in favor of a hospital in the absence of medical testimony establishing "reasonable medical probability" as to proximate cause of injury.  Duff, 751 S.W.2d at 176. [*7]  The Dowells, on the other hand, point to the testimony of Dr. Thomas Donica, a teacher and practitioner of psychiatry, who testified as an expert that Dr. Pettit's negligence was a cause-in-fact of Lance's suicide. Dr. Pettit did not object to this testimony when offered, but objected to the submission of the causation issue and moved for judgment n.o.v. 2  \n  [*8]  Citing Coastal Transport Co., Inc. v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., Dr. Pettit says that Dr. Donica's testimony is "no evidence" because his opinion is not reliable.  Coastal Transport Co., Inc. v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 229, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 559 (Tex. 2004). We have made a careful analysis of Dr. Donica's testimony and have come to the conclusion that his expert testimony cannot be said to be "non-probative on its face" because it is conclusory or speculative, but his testimony was probative on the question of causation and the jury was entitled to rely on it in reaching a verdict. We find the evidence legally sufficient to support the jury's finding of causation. See  City of Keller, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 436, 2005 WL 1366509, at *2, *10. We overrule issue one. \n  \n ISSUES TWO AND THREE \n  \n CAN THE PARENTS RECOVER SURVIVAL DAMAGES? \n The award of survival-statute damages is attacked in two issues. \n  \n No Evidence of Pain or Mental Anguish \n In question 5, which asked about the amount of damages that would compensate Lance for (a) pain and mental anguish and (b) funeral and burial expenses, the jury's answer was $ 400,000. Dr. Pettit's second issue asserts that there [*9]  is no evidence 3  to support an award of survival damages "in the amount found by the jury." He reasons that the funeral and burial expenses were $ 6,815, so the jury must have found $ 393,185 for pain and mental anguish. Although he acknowledges that such damages may be proven by circumstantial evidence, he says there is no evidence of conscious pain and suffering before Lance's death. \n This argument was rejected by the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals in  Spohn Hospital v. Mayer, 72 S.W.3d 52, 68 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 2002), rev'd on other grounds,  104 S.W.3d 878, 46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 604 (Tex. 2003). There, the court found that the medical examiner's certificate of death that stated "asphyxia by hanging" was some evidence of probative value that would support the jury's finding of damages for pain and mental anguish suffered by the deceased prior to his death. Id. As the Dowells point out, Lance's death certificate [*10]  is almost identical to the certificate in Mayer. We overrule issue two. \n  \n Standing to Sue \n Dr. Pettit's third issue asserts that the Dowells have no standing to recover survival damages. He points to the fact that he denied their legal capacity to sue in a verified pleading, that no personal representative of Lance's estate had been appointed when the suit began, and that Lance was survived by a minor son, Alec, who is not a party to the suit. 4  \n Carolyn Dowell was appointed as Administratrix of the Estate of Jonathan Lance Dowell by the County Court of Freestone County on September 24, 2001, by an order which authorized her to act on behalf of the estate in this suit. The judgment dated September 28, 2001, awards $ 80,000 (20% of $ 400,000) to "Jimmy Dowell and Carolyn Dowell, on behalf of the Estate of Jonathan Lance Dowell [*11]  . . ., calculated as reflected in Exhibit '1' to this judgment. . . ." Exhibit "1" reflects three sections: (1) damages awarded to the Estate, (2) damages awarded to Jimmy Dowell, and (3) damages awarded to Carolyn Dowell. The $ 80,000 award is listed in the section awarded to the Estate. \n The Dowells pled in their third amended petition that they were Lance's only known heirs at law, that no administration was pending or necessary, and that Carolyn had applied to be appointed "solely for purposes of this lawsuit," anticipating that she would be so appointed prior to the time of trial. \n The question concerning the Dowells' right to maintain this suit is one of capacity, not standing. See  Austin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, 171 S.W.3d 845, 48 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 624, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 386, 2005 WL 1124764, at *3 (Tex. May 13, 2005);  Lorentz v. Dunn, 171 S.W.3d 854, 48 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 630, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 387, 2005 WL 1124768, at *2 (Tex. May 13, 2005). Carolyn ultimately qualified as administratrix of Lance's estate. Although the text of the judgment could be more specific to reflect the amounts of the awards shown on the Exhibit, we believe that the court correctly awarded the survival damages in question to the Dowells on behalf of the Estate. See  Lovato, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 386, 2005 WL 1124764,  [*12]  at *3;  Lorentz, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 387, 2005 WL 1124768, at *2. Furthermore, based on the relation-back doctrine, no limitations issue is present. See  Lovato, 2005 Tex. LEXIS 386, 2005 WL 1124764, at *6. We overrule issue three. \n  \n ISSUE FOUR \n  \n THE WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM \n Dr. Pettit's fourth issue asks whether the trial court erred in entering judgment because the Dowells failed to prosecute the wrongful death action on behalf of Lance's son, Alec, whom he says is a necessary party. He says that he also pointed out this defect in a verified pleading. If Alec attacks the judgment in the future, he says, it will not be a bar to further proceedings. \n The Dowells say that Dr. Pettit's argument is a throwback to the former "indispensable party" rule, in which the absence of such a party was deemed "fundamental error" requiring reversal of the judgment. They point out that each wrongful death beneficiary can recover only damages specific to that individual and that Dr. Pettit will not be subjected to double liability if Alec were to bring a suit because there is no evidence of any relationship between Lance and Alec and therefore no damages suffered by Alec. \n The jury charge specifically asked [*13]  about damages to Jimmy and Carolyn by name. Alec was not mentioned. Without evidence of any interaction or familial relationship between Alec and Lance and without evidence that Lance ever supported or was capable of financially supporting Alec, it would not be improper to proceed without Alec because he would not be entitled to any benefits. See  Henwood v. Richardson, 163 S.W.2d 256, 258 (Tex. Civ. App.--Texarkana 1942, writ ref'd w.o.m.). Based on Plaintiff's Third Amended Petition, the record reflects that the suit was brought on behalf of all parties entitled to bring a wrongful death suit.  Texas Health Enters., Inc. v. Geisler, 9 S.W.3d 163, 169-70 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1999, pet. dism'd). \n In addition, the Wrongful Death Act provides a three-month window for any statutory beneficiary to file an action "for the benefit of all." TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 71.004(b), (c) (Vernon 1997). If none of the statutory beneficiaries bring an action within the three months, the executor or administrator must bring the action unless requested not to do so by any of the statutory beneficiaries. Id. As parents,  [*14]  Jimmy and Carolyn were entitled to bring the action individually. As the administratrix, Carolyn was also entitled to bring the action on behalf of the estate. Since Alec, or his next friend, did not bring a suit within three months, did not object to Carolyn filing as administratrix, and declined an invitation to join the Dowell's case, there is support for the trial courts' not abating the wrongful death suit. See  Serv-Air, Inc. v. Profitt, 18 S.W.3d 652, 664 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1999, pet. dism'd). We overrule issue four. \n  \n ISSUE FIVE \n  \n FACTUAL SUFFICIENCY OF CAUSATION \n The fifth issue is factual sufficiency of the evidence of causation. Dr. Pettit essentially asserts that because the evidence that Lance was not actively suicidal when he was discharged from the emergency room is so overwhelming, the evidence is factually insufficient to support the proximate cause finding. We use the standard of review set out above. \n Causation is a matter that is a particularly apt question for a jury.  Farley v. M M Cattle Co., 529 S.W.2d 751, 756, 18 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 398 (Tex. 1975). The factfinder is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be [*15]  given their testimony. See  Leyva v. Pacheco, 163 Tex. 638, 358 S.W.2d 547, 549, 5 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 475 (1962). The factfinder may believe one witness and disbelieve another, and resolve inconsistencies in testimony. See  McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697, 30 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 96 (Tex. 1986). Where enough evidence is before the factfinder that reasonable minds could differ on the meaning of the evidence or the inferences and conclusions to be drawn from the evidence, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder. See  Herbert v. Herbert, 754 S.W.2d 141, 144, 31 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 453 (Tex. 1988). \n We apply these rules to conflicting expert testimony. Having reviewed all of the evidence in a neutral light, we cannot say that the evidence supporting the jury's finding of causation in question one was either weak or overwhelmed by Dr. Pettit's contrary proof.  Checker Bag, 27 S.W.3d at 633. We overrule issue five. \n  \n ISSUE SIX \n  \n LANCE DOWELL'S NEGLIGENCE \n Dr. Pettit's sixth issue is that the trial court erred in refusing to submit questions to the jury inquiring whether Lance was negligent and, if so, his percentage of responsibility for his own death. The Dowells point [*16]  to section 93.001(a)(2) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which provides that suicide, a defense when it is the sole cause of damage sustained, may not be used as a defense when it was caused in whole or in part by a failure of the defendant to comply with an applicable legal standard. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 93.001(a)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2004-05). Dr. Pettit responds that he did not attempt to use Lance's suicide as a defense but wanted to ask the jury to determine if he was negligent and caused his own death. \n This issue was decided by the Corpus Christi Court.  Alvarado v. City of Brownsville, 865 S.W.2d 148, 153-54 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1993), rev'd on other grounds,  897 S.W.2d 750, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 440 (Tex. 1995); see also  Kassen v. Hatley, 887 S.W.2d 4, 12, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 73 (Tex. 1994) ("Kalra and Southwestern had no defense under this section if they failed to comply with the standard of care, and their failure was a cause of Johnson's suicide."). \n Asking such a question was not necessary to allow the jury to render a verdict upon which the court could enter judgment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 277 [*17]  . If the jury failed to find that Dr. Pettit's negligence proximately caused Lance's suicide, Dr. Pettit was exonerated. If the jury found to the contrary, as it did, section 93.001(a)(2) precludes Lance's suicide from being used as an affirmative defense. We overrule issue six. \n  \n ISSUE SEVEN \n  \n ARE THE DAMAGES EXCESSIVE? \n In issue seven, Dr. Pettit says that the survival-action damages for pain and mental anguish are excessive. He acknowledges that such damages may be proven by circumstantial evidence, and we agree. He also acknowledges that such damages are left to the sound discretion of the jury. \n An appellate court may not order a remittitur unless the evidence supporting damages is factually insufficient.  Torrington Co. v. Stutzman, 46 S.W.3d 829, 851, 44 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 225 (Tex. 2000). Again, we use the standard of review set out above. Based on the record as a whole and the jury's finding of liability, the amount of the award in this case fails to "leave no room for doubt" that the jury's liability findings resulted from passion or prejudice. See id. We overrule issue seven. \n  \n CONCLUSION \n We have overruled all of his issues; thus, we affirm the judgment as to Dr.  [*18]  Pettit. \n BILL VANCE \n Justice  \n Dissent by: TOM GRAY \n Dissent \n  \n  \n  \n DISSENTING OPINION \n This is an appeal of a wrongful death and survival suit. We should reverse and render. Because the majority does not do so, I respectfully dissent. \n In Appellant's first issue, he contends that there was no evidence of proximate cause. We should sustain this issue. \n Appellees contend that Appellant waived his issue by failing to object to the testimony of one of Appellees' expert witnesses. The cases cited by Appellees, to the extent that they are on point, concern the waiver of objections to the methodological reliability of expert testimony, not the sufficiency of the evidence. See  Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 409, 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683 (Tex. 1998);  Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Coastal Transp. Co., 38 S.W.3d 180, 190 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2001), rev'd,  136 S.W.3d 227, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 559 (Tex. 2004);  Gen. Motors Corp. v. Castaneda, 980 S.W.2d 777, 780 n.2 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1998, pet. denied). 1  By making an objection to the charge, filing a motion to disregard jury questions and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and filing a motion for new [*19]  trial, all on the grounds that there was no evidence of proximate cause, Appellant preserved his no-evidence complaint. See  Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Helton, 133 S.W.3d 245, 259, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 248 (Tex. 2004);  T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 220, 36 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 259 (Tex. 1992). \n Appellees contend that Appellant failed to conduct an appropriate medical examination of Lance Dowell, or failed to admit Lance to a psychiatric hospital, and that that failure caused Lance's death. Appellant treated Lance in a hospital emergency room for shallow self-inflicted cuts to his wrists. The undisputed evidence was that when Appellant treated Lance, Lance was lucid, calm, remorseful, stable, and not actively suicidal. There is no evidence that, if Appellant had recommended admission to a psychiatric hospital, Lance would [*20]  have agreed or could have been compelled to be admitted. After Lance was released from the hospital to Appellees, and until his death, they saw nothing out of the ordinary about him except that he was "more withdrawn." The day that he was released from the hospital, Lance visited with his family, went to a rodeo, and visited with friends. The next day, he had lunch with his family and helped a friend bale hay. About a day and a half after he left the hospital, Lance hanged himself. Appellees' expert testified, at most, that had Lance been admitted to a hospital the probability that he would commit suicide upon his release would have been reduced. \n Under these facts, there is no evidence that Appellant's conduct was a substantial cause of Lance's death. See  IHS Cedars Treatment Ctr. of Desoto, Tex., Inc. v. Ramos, 143 S.W.3d 794, 798-800, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 666 (Tex. 2004);  Marathon Corp. v. Pitzner, 106 S.W.3d 724, 727, 46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 689 (Tex. 2003);  St. Joseph Hosp. v. Wolff, 94 S.W.3d 513, 519-20, 46 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 142 (Tex. 2002);  Dallas County Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Bossley, 968 S.W.2d 339, 343-44, 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 653 (Tex. 1998). Accordingly, we should sustain Appellant's first issue.  \n  [*21]  We should, then, after sustaining Appellant's first issue, reverse and render judgment that Appellees take nothing from Appellant. Therefore, we should not consider Appellant's other issues. \n Because the disposition of the first issue would be dispositive of the appeal, I will not discuss my disagreements with the remainder of the majority's opinion. I note only in passing that an estate, by that name, is not a proper party to litigation.  Embrey v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 22 S.W.3d 414, 415 n.2, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 652 (Tex. 2000);  Price v. Estate of Anderson, 522 S.W.2d 690, 691, 18 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 322 (Tex. 1975). I also note that two notices of appeal from the same judgment should bear the same docket number on appeal. TEX. R. APP. P. 12.2(c). Docketing this cause and Cause No. 10-02-00026-CV, styled Providence Health Ctr. v. Dowell, as two separate appeals was improper. \n TOM GRAY \n Chief Justice \n Dissenting opinion delivered and filed August 10, 2005  \n  \n  \n End of Document \n
