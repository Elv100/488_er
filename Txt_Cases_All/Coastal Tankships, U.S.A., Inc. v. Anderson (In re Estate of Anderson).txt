Case Summary \n  \n  \n Procedural Posture \n Appellee administratrix filed a personal injury suit for Jones Act negligence and unseaworthiness under general maritime law. Over appellant tankship company's objection, the videotaped deposition testimony of the administratrix's sole testifying expert on medical causation was introduced into evidence. A jury of the 212th District Court, Galveston County, Texas, awarded $ 1,254,500 damages to the administratrix. The company appealed. \n Overview \n The company owned a tanker. The administratrix's husband suffered no chronic illnesses or respiratory problems, never smoked, was physically active, and passed the company's health examination. He joined the crew, the tanker twice loaded naphtha and carried it for about 11 days, and strong chemical fumes were smelled in the ship. Of 29 crew members, only the husband became ill. He was diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). On appeal, the company argued that the trial court wrongly allowed the diagnosing doctor to testify that the naphtha exposure caused the BOOP, and that the medical causation evidence was legally insufficient. The appellate court agreed. Both general and specific causation had to be proven in a toxic-tort suit for a plaintiff to prevail. The doctor's differential diagnosis, no matter how reliable the trial court impliedly found it, by definition could at most only show specific causation. Thus the trial court abused its discretion in admitting it. The Daubert/Robinson/Jordan reliability test applied also in the sufficiency review. The Jones Act "featherweight" causation standard could not transform no evidence into some evidence. \n Outcome \n The judgment was reversed and rendered in favor of the company. \n Counsel: FOR APPELLANT: Chester Joseph Makowski, Royston, Rayzor, Vickery & Williams, Houston, TX. \n FOR APPELLEE: Paul Dodson, Huseman & Pletcher, Corpus Christi, TX.   \n Judges: Panel consists of Justices Cohen, Brister, 32  and Smith. 33  Justice Brister dissented from the panel's decision to affirm the trial court's judgment.

(Coastal), appeals from a jury verdict awarding damages to appellee, Florence Anderson, administratrix of the estate of Morris Anderson. 2  Coastal presents six issues for our review. In its first and second issues, which are dispositive of the appeal, Coastal contends that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Anderson's medical expert to testify that  [*595]  exposure to the chemical naphtha 3  caused Anderson's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and, thus, (2) there was legally insufficient evidence of medical causation to support the jury's verdict. We reverse and render. \n  [**4]  We note at the outset, in regard to these two issues, that our primary role is to ascertain whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding reliable, and thus in admitting, expert testimony under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.  Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, 47 S.W.3d 486, 499, 44 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 675 (Tex. 2001);  Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 718, 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1117-19 (Tex. 1998). If expert testimony is not reliable, it is not evidence.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 721-29 (Tex. 1997). Due to the confusion regarding the appropriate way to analyze the reliability of the expert opinion in this case and the application of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and its Texas progeny, a thorough review of the facts of this case and the applicable case law is necessary. \n I. Facts and Procedural Background \n  Coastal owned and operated the steam tanker S.S. COASTAL MANATEE. Anderson joined the crew of the COASTAL MANATEE on July 6, 1994 as a utility hand in the steward's department. He was healthy and physically capable [**5]  of performing his duties when his voyage began. Before then, he had suffered no chronic illnesses, pneumonia, or respiratory problems; had never smoked; had been physically active; and had passed Coastal's health examination. During the voyage, the COASTAL MANATEE twice loaded naphtha, which the vessel carried for approximately 11 days. Viewed in the light most favorable to Anderson, both times naphtha was loaded, he and other crew members smelled particularly strong chemical fumes throughout the ship. Anderson and at least one other crew member, radio electronics officer Butch Smith, smelled fumes in their quarters. The fumes once drove Smith out of his room to sleep elsewhere. 4  Anderson soon began having headaches, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, shoulder stiffness, and tightness in his chest. Anderson was sent to his quarters to rest for at least five days, and his condition worsened until he was so ill that he could no longer perform his duties. None of the other approximately 29 crew members aboard the COASTAL MANATEE became ill from the fumes or developed BOOP, and only one to three other crew members felt occasional nausea. On September 23, 1994, Anderson had [**6]  to be taken ashore aboard a motor launch. When he came ashore, Anderson was sick, had labored breathing, and looked like he "was caving in." \n A few days later, Anderson went to the hospital under the care of Dr. Eugene Brown, who referred Anderson to pulmonary specialist Dr. David Miller. Dr. Miller became Anderson's treating physician and diagnosed Anderson with BOOP. The evidence in the light most favorable to Anderson shows that, despite objective testing indicating his respiratory health  [*596]  gradually improved, he felt symptoms associated with BOOP until his death of prostate cancer, which was unrelated to his BOOP. \n Anderson sued Coastal for his personal injuries, alleging negligence under the Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritime law. The case was tried to a jury. Over the objection of Coastal, the [**7]  videotaped deposition testimony of Dr. Miller, Anderson's sole testifying expert on medical causation, was introduced into evidence. \n Dr. Miller, who had been board certified in pulmonary disease and internal medicine for 15 and 20 years respectively, testified that he saw "lots of . . . common inhalation type problems" in his practice. Dr. Miller stated that Anderson told him he had inhaled a "gaseous" material (naphtha) while working aboard the COASTAL MANATEE and related the acute symptoms he had suffered. 5  [**9]  Dr. Miller noted that Anderson's oral history was consistent with Dr. Miller's experience of those injured by chemical exposure. Dr. Miller ordered chest x-rays and lung-function tests. After reviewing the lung-function test results, examining Anderson, and reviewing Anderson's medical records, Dr. Miller initially diagnosed Anderson with pneumonia secondary to chemical inhalation. The lung x-rays showed abnormal areas, which were also consistent with Anderson's symptoms and with injury from chemical inhalation. Dr. Miller then ordered a surgical biopsy, which revealed that Anderson had BOOP. In the end, Dr. Miller diagnosed that Anderson had sustained a "significant inhalation [**8]  injury," consistent with the inhalation of fumes aboard the vessel, and opined that "chemical inhalation" had caused Anderson's acute lung problems. In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Miller ruled out several other possible causes of Anderson's BOOP by considering Anderson's work and personal history, temporal proximity of the fumes and symptoms, medical records, and test results. 6   \n On cross-examination, Dr. Miller conceded that BOOP is usually idiopathic. 7  Nonetheless, Dr. Miller believed there was a causal relationship between the chemical exposure and Anderson's BOOP, based on his examination, the test results, the timing of the illness, and Anderson's history. 8   [*597]  Furthermore, although Dr. Keith Wilson, Coastal's own medical-causation expert, agreed that BOOP is idiopathic about a third of the time, he conceded that BOOP has some recognized causes, including some toxic fume exposures. 9  Dr. Wilson also testified that chemical pneumonia, which [**10]  Dr. Brown concluded Mr. Anderson first had, can cause BOOP. \n However, Dr. Miller was not aware of any literature associating BOOP with exposure to chemicals other than oxides of nitrogen, which he conceded are found "everywhere." Similarly, Dr. Wilson testified [**11]  that he was unable to find any literature connecting BOOP to naphtha exposure. Dr. Wilson also testified without dispute that the medical literature associates BOOP with only limited chemical agents, such as nitrogens of oxide, which naphtha does not contain. Additionally, Dr. Miller acknowledged (1) he was not a toxicologist, (2) he did not know how much naphtha Anderson was exposed to or for how long, and (3) his diagnosis presumed that there was a causal relationship between naphtha exposure and BOOP. \n Aside from the above expert testimony, the only other evidence of causation in the record was (1) Dr. Brown's statements in the medical records, the discharge summary, and other notes; (2) the naphtha material safety data sheet (MSDS); 10  and (3) lay testimony that Anderson was healthy before inhaling the fumes, but ill very soon afterwards. \n  [**12]  The jury found Coastal negligent and the vessel unseaworthy and awarded Anderson $ 1,254,500, including damages for past physical pain and mental anguish. \n II. Standard of Review \n We, as an appellate court, may not disturb a trial court's determination that a witness is or is not qualified as an expert unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.  Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718-19; Hernandez v. State, 53 S.W.3d 742, 750 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). We will not conclude that a trial court abused its discretion simply because we would have ruled differently in the same circumstances or the trial court committed a mere error in judgment. See  Hernandez, 53 S.W.3d at 750. The test is not whether the facts present an appropriate case for the trial court's action in the opinion of the reviewing court; rather, we gauge an abuse of discretion by whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles.  E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 558, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 852 (Tex. 1995). Thus, a trial court enjoys wide latitude in determining whether expert testimony is admissible.  [**13]  Hernandez, 53 S.W.3d at 750; see Hon. Harvey Brown, Procedural Issues Under Daubert, 36 HOUS. L. REV. 1133, 1159 (1999) [hereinafter "Brown-Procedural"]. \n III. Expert Testimony \n An expert may testify on scientific, technical, or other specialized subjects if the  [*598]  testimony would assist the fact finder in understanding the evidence or determining a fact issue. See TEX. R. EVID. 702. \n A. Daubert \n In Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Frye 11  "general acceptance" test was no longer applicable under the new Federal Rules of Evidence and offered some "general observations." 509 U.S. at 593, 113 S. Ct. at 2796. These "general observations" set new standards for the admissibility of expert testimony. The Court held that "the trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable." 509 U.S. at 589, 113 S. Ct. at 2795 (emphasis added). \n  [**14]   \n Although "not presuming to set out a definitive checklist or test" in considering the admissibility of expert scientific testimony, the Daubert Court offered the following as a "flexible" inquiry to be made by the trial court: \n 1. whether the theory or technique "can be (and has been) tested"; \n 2. whether the theory or technique "has been subjected to peer review and publication"; \n 3. what is "the known or potential rate of error" for any tests or techniques; and \n 4. whether there is "general acceptance" in the relevant scientific community. \n 509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S. Ct. at 2796-97 (citations omitted).  \n  \n B. Daubert's Texas Progeny \n Emphasizing the importance of trial courts' "scrutinizing proffered evidence for scientific reliability when it is based upon novel scientific theories, sometimes referred to as 'junk science,'" but not limiting its holding to novel theories, the Texas Supreme Court adopted the Daubert analysis in regard to Texas Rule of Evidence 702.  Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 554. Although noting that the factors the trial court may consider in making its determination will differ in each case, the Robinson [**15]  court offered its own version of the Daubert inquiry, which included, but was not limited to, the following factors: \n 1. the extent to which the theory has been tested; \n 2. the extent to which the technique relies upon the expert's subjective interpretation; \n 3. whether the theory has been subject to peer review; \n 4. the technique's potential rate of error; \n 5. whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community; and \n 6. the nonjudicial uses that have been made of the theory or technique. \n Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557. \n Daubert's test was adopted in almost identical form by the Court of Criminal Appeals. 12  [**17]  For example, after having previously utilized a Daubert-esque analysis in Kelly v. State, 824 S.W.2d 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), 13  the Texas Court of Criminal  [*599]  Appeals embraced Daubert in reversing and remanding a trial court decision that excluded the testimony of an expert on eyewitness identification.  Jordan v. State, 928 S.W.2d 550, 555-56 Tex. Crim. App. 1996). The court cited the following "list of nonexclusive factors that could [**16]  affect a trial court's determination of reliability": \n 1. the extent to which the underlying scientific theory and technique are accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community, if such a community can be ascertained; \n 2. the qualifications of the expert(s) testifying; \n 3. the existence of literature supporting or rejecting the underlying scientific theory and technique; \n 4. the potential rate of error of the technique; \n 5. the availability of other experts to test and evaluate the technique; \n 6. the clarity with which the underlying scientific theory and technique can be explained to the court; and \n 7. the experience and skill of the person(s) who applied the technique on the occasion in question. \n Id. at 554 & n.6 (citing Kelly, 824 S.W.2d at 573) (emphasis added). This inquiry is "substantively identical to the inquiry mandated by the Supreme Court . . . in Daubert . . . ." Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 560 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998), overruled on other grounds, State v. Terrazas 4 S.W.3d 720, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). \n We have noted that our highest courts have repeatedly emphasized that the pertinent, suggested inquiries in assessing the reliability of expert testimony are applied flexibly and are not exclusive or required. 14  [**18]  Hernandez, 53 S.W.3d at 752 (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S. Ct. at 2797 and Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557). A trial court may make other inquiries, instead of or in addition to those noted in Daubert, Robinson, and Jordan, that are germane to an expert's qualifications and field of expertise in determining the reliability of the proffered evidence.  Hernandez, 53 S.W.3d at 752. The "methods of proving reliability will vary, depending upon the field of expertise." 15  Id.  \n Both the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals have also held that non-scientific expert testimony (i.e., that involving technical or other specialized knowledge) must also meet the reliability requirement of Daubert/Robinson/Jordan.  Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718; Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 562. Both courts have further noted, however, that the Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiries for assessing the reliability of [**19]  scientific evidence may not always apply to other kinds of expert testimony. Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726; Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 562; accord  [*600]  Helena Chem., 47 S.W.3d at 499 (citing Gammill for proposition that Robinson's inquiries may not apply to certain testimony). \n In Nenno, the Court of Criminal Appeals pointed out that the Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiries "do not necessarily apply outside the hard science context." Id. at 561 (emphasis added). The court emphasized that "methods of proving reliability will vary, depending upon the field of expertise," and recognized that, \n when addressing fields of study aside from the hard sciences, such as the social sciences or fields that are based primarily upon experience and training as opposed to the scientific method, Kelly's requirement of reliability applies but with less rigor than to the hard sciences. To speak of the validity of a "theory" or "technique" in these fields may be roughly accurate but somewhat misleading. \n Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 561 (emphasis added). 16   \n  [**20]   \n Acknowledging that "hard science methods of validation, such as assessing the potential rate of error or subjecting a theory  [*601]  to peer review, may often be inappropriate for testing the reliability of fields of expertise outside the hard sciences," the Nenno court offered an appropriately tailored translation of the Daubert inquiry to areas outside hard science, as follows: \n 1. whether the field of expertise is a legitimate one; \n 2. whether the subject matter of the expert's testimony is within the scope of that field; and \n 3. whether the expert's testimony properly relies upon and/or utilizes the principles involved in the field. 17   \n Id. 18  \n  [**21]   \n Mindful of these guiding rules and principles, we address Coastal's first and second [**22]  issues. \n IV. Analysis \n In its first issue, Coastal contends the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Anderson's medical expert, Dr. David Miller, to testify that naphtha exposure caused Anderson's BOOP. Specifically, Coastal claims Dr. Miller's methodology was unreliable. At trial, Coastal timely objected to Dr. Miller's opinion testimony on causation. Once Coastal objected, Anderson had the burden to show that Dr. Miller's methodology was sound. See  Gammill, 972 S.W.2d. at 718. \n  \n A. Applicable Causation Burdens and Principles \n Two burdens of proof apply. Under the Jones Act, Anderson had to show that Coastal's negligence played any part, "even the slightest," in producing Anderson's BOOP.  E.g., Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406, 41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683 (Tex. 1998). For his unseaworthiness claim, Anderson had to show that the unseaworthy condition played a substantial part in bringing about or actually causing Anderson's BOOP and that his BOOP was either a direct result or a reasonably probable consequence of the COASTAL MANATEE's unseaworthiness. E.g., Offshore Pipelines v. Schooley, 984 S.W.2d 654, 663 [**23]  (Tex. App--Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.). \n Two causation principles also apply. First, in regard to the causation issues presented in this case, we are mindful that toxic-tort case law is instructive by analogy. One common way of understanding toxic-tort causation is to break it down into general causation and specific causation. 19   [*602]  General causation asks whether a substance is capable of causing a particular injury in the general population; specific causation asks whether that substance caused a particular individual's injury. See  Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 714; Neal v. Dow Agrosciences L.L.C., 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 2035, No. 05-01-00254-CV, slip op. at __ (Tex. App.--Dallas Mar. 20, 2002, no pet. h.) (designated for publication) (quoting Havner and applying distinction); Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d 183, 191 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1998, pet. denied) (same); Sanders at 110. 20  Proving one type of causation does not necessarily prove the other, and logic dictates that both are needed for a plaintiff in a toxic-tort suit to prevail. 21  See  Atterbury, 978  [*603]  S.W.2d at 199-200, 203; Sanders at 110. 22   \n  [**24]   \n  [**25]   \n Second, expert testimony is required to prove causation in this case, contrary to Anderson's claim. To establish causation in a personal injury case, a plaintiff must prove the [**26]  defendant's conduct caused an event and that that event caused the plaintiff to suffer compensable damages. See  Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 848 (Tex. 1995). The causal link between the event sued upon and the plaintiff's injuries must be shown by competent evidence.  Morgan v. Compugraphic Corp., 675 S.W.2d 729, 731 (Tex. 1984). A jury may decide the required causal nexus between the event sued upon and the plaintiff's injuries when (1) general experience and common sense will enable a lay person fairly to determine the causal nexus, (2) expert testimony establishes a traceable chain of causation from injuries back to the event, or (3) expert testimony shows a probable-cause nexus.  Weidner v. Sanchez, 14 S.W.3d 353, 370 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.); Blankenship v. Mirick, 984 S.W.2d 771, 775 (Tex. App--Waco 1999, pet. denied). \n The evidence was undisputed that BOOP has several possible causes and is idiopathic a third of the time. General experience and common sense simply do not enable a fair understanding of causation under these circumstances; accordingly, expert testimony [**27]  is required. 23  See  Lenger v. Physician's Gen. Hosp., Inc., 455 S.W.2d 703, 706 (Tex. 1970) (noting that "when the proof discloses that a given result may have occurred by reason of more than one proximate cause, and the jury can do no more than guess or speculate as to which is, in fact, the efficient cause, the submission of such choice to the jury has been consistently condemned by this court and by other courts."); Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Myers, 411 S.W.2d 710, 713 (Tex. 1966) (holding that, when coupled with insufficient expert testimony, lay testimony and factual circumstances did not show injury aggravated cancerous tumor); Allen v. Roddis Lumber & Veneer Co., 796 S.W.2d 758, 763 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied) (holding lay affidavit created no fact issues on cause of formaldehyde emissions); Hernandez v. Tex. Employers Ins. Ass'n, 783 S.W.2d 250, 252-53 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1989, no writ) (holding expert testimony needed to determine cause of asthma, which had uncertain causal nature); Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Davis, 620 S.W.2d 734, 736-37 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1981,  [**28]  writ ref'd n.r.e.) (holding that, because expert testimony  [*604]  implied various possible causes, lay jury could not determine whether injuries were caused by accident); Ill. Employers Ins. of Wasau v. Wilson, 620 S.W.2d 169, 172 (Tex. Civ. App.--Tyler 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (holding lay testimony alone did not suffice to connect injury to particular infection, given disease's complexity and time between injury and loss); Porter v. Whitehall Labs., Inc., 9 F.3d 607, 612 (7th Cir. 1993) (requiring expert testimony on whether medicine caused condition leading to renal failure and applying Daubert to that testimony). \n  [**29]  B. The Reliability of Dr. Miller's Differential Diagnosis \n Here, because Dr. Miller's medical causation opinion testimony falls outside the category of "hard science," and not all of the Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiries thus make sense when applied to his opinion testimony, we turn to Nenno's translation of the these inquiries. We therefore consider \n 1. whether Dr. Miller's field of expertise is a legitimate one; \n 2. whether the subject matter of Dr. Miller's testimony is within the scope of that field; and \n 3. whether Dr. Miller's testimony properly relies upon and/or utilizes the principles involved in the field. \n See  Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 561. \n The trial court would not have abused its discretion if it impliedly found that Dr. Miller met the first two Nenno inquiries. As a pulmonologist, Dr. Miller's field of expertise is certainly legitimate. His testimony further revealed that he has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating acute lung injuries, including those caused by chemical exposure. His causation opinion testimony concerned Anderson's BOOP and was within the scope of his field of expertise.  \n In regard to his reliance [**30]  upon and utilization of the principles of his field, Nenno's third inquiry, Dr. Miller used a "differential diagnosis," sometimes referred to as "differential etiology." This is a clinical process whereby a doctor determines which of several potential diseases or injuries is causing the patient's symptoms by ruling out possible causes--by comparing the patient's symptoms to symptoms associated with known diseases, conducting physical examinations, collecting data on the patient's history and illness, and analyzing that data--until a final diagnosis for proper treatment is reached. See Neal, No. 05-01-00254-CV, slip op. at __ n.3 (quoting Atterbury); Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 199-200, 203; Kannankeril v. Terminix Int'l, Inc., 128 F.3d 802, 807 (3rd Cir. 1997). Differential diagnosis is "the basic method of internal medicine" and enjoys widespread acceptance in the medical community. See, e.g., Heller v. Shaw Indus., Inc., 167 F.3d 146, 156 (3rd Cir. 1999) (quoting In re Paoli); In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 755, 758 (3rd Cir. 1994). Generally speaking, when properly conducted the [**31]  technique has important non-judicial uses, is generally accepted as valid by the medical community, and has been subjected to use, peer review, and testing. See  Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557. \n Even with all the advances of medical science, the practice of medicine remains an art. A properly conducted and explained differential diagnosis is not "junk science." If a differential diagnosis provides a sufficient basis on which to prescribe medical treatment with potential life-or-death consequences, it should be considered reliable enough to assist a fact finder in understanding certain evidence  [*605]  or determining certain fact issues. 24   \n  [**32]  In answer to Nenno's third inquiry, Dr. Miller's opinion was based on what the trial court could reasonably have concluded was a properly explained and conducted differential diagnosis, which is in itself a reliable and widely accepted methodology. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion if it impliedly found Dr. Miller gave a reliable differential diagnosis under Daubert/Robinson/Jordan. 25   \n  [*606]  \n  \n  [**33] C. The Limits of What Dr. Miller's Differential Diagnosis Can Prove \n Our holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion if it impliedly found Dr. Miller offered a reliable differential diagnosis does not end our inquiry, however. The question remains as to what Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis can prove. \n The federal courts are split on whether a differential diagnosis, without more, can reliably show both specific and general causation under Daubert in the toxic-tort context. See  Heller, 167 F.3d at 154-55 (recognizing disagreement); see generally Sanders at 121 ("Nevertheless, substantial disagreement still remains on what constitutes a reliable differential diagnosis. Two dimensions highlight this disagreement: (1) whether one must 'rule in' the putative cause before 'ruling out' other causes; and (2) whether temporal order alone--that the cause preceded the effect--is sufficient to support the causal attribution."); Hon. Harvey Brown, Eight Gates for Expert Witnesses, 36 HOUS. L. REV. 743, 849 (Fall 1999) [hereinafter "Brown-Gates"] (recognizing split); Jack E. Karnes, Establishing the Standard for a Physician's  [**34]   Patient Diagnosis Using Scientific Evidence: Dealing with the Split of Authority Amongst the Circuit Courts of Appeal, 15 B.Y.U. J. PUB. L. 1 (2000).  \n One branch of federal case law indicates that a properly conducted and explained differential diagnosis, by itself or with little else, could sufficiently establish causation for a toxic-tort plaintiff to prevail. 26   [*607]  These courts apparently view a differential diagnosis as establishing both general and specific causation (even if they do not always use those precise terms). See generally Sanders at 124 (discussing and collecting cases). Anderson relies on cases like these. \n  [**35]  In contrast, other federal courts indicate that a differential diagnosis does not, by itself, establish causation sufficiently for a toxic-tort plaintiff to prevail. See generally id. at 122-24 (discussing and collecting cases). Rather, these courts also require some type of "hard science" on the issue of general causation (even if they do not always use that precise term), i.e., whether the chemical can cause the illness generally, before allowing in differential-diagnosis testimony. 27  They likely impose this requirement  [*608]  because a differential diagnosis presumes, but does not solely establish, that the chemical is capable of producing harmful effects generally. See Brown-Gates at 858 (citing Hall v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 947 F. Supp. 1387, 1413 (D. Or. 1996)). That is, a differential diagnosis can only "rule out," but does not itself "rule in," the possible causes of an illness. See  Cavallo v. Star Enters., 892 F. Supp. 756, 771-72 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd in part on same grounds, rev'd in part on other grounds, 100 F.3d 1150, 1159 (4th Cir.); Sanders at 122-24 ("The 'rule in before rule out' position of Cavallo [**36]  presumes that, at least in toxic tort cases, a differential diagnosis, no matter how well done, can rarely prove general causation by itself. The Cavallo position has been repeated in numerous cases.") (collecting cases); Brown-Gates at 858 (citing Cavallo). Coastal relies on cases like these. \n  [**37]  At least one Texas court has concluded, in the context of a toxic-tort suit for negligence and product liability, that a doctor's differential diagnosis by itself would, at best, be evidence of specific causation only: \n Another form of scientific evidence is known as differential diagnosis. This involves a history of the patient and a physical examination, and refers to the process a physician would undertake to eliminate other generally known causes of illnesses and injuries to diagnose a specific cause of a particular patient's illness or injury. The Texas Supreme Court has stated, "an expert's assertion that a physical examination confirmed causation should not be accepted at face value." [Havner] at 720. Clearly, an expert's recitation that he has examined a patient and has done a history of the patient and has concluded that X caused the patient to suffer with Y would not be sufficient to support causation. If the physician explained the exact methodology that he used in arriving at the conclusion, including discussing the exact other causes that have been ruled out and the generally accepted literature that he relied upon in making that conclusion, the differential diagnosis [**38]  evidence could be sufficient to prove specific causation. Even though some courts have held that differential diagnosis is a valid form of evidence to support general causation, it most likely is not sufficient under current standards promulgated by the Texas Supreme Court. This statement is made based upon what appears to be the court's total reliance on objective evidence and its disdain for any form of subjective analysis. \n Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 199. 28   \n  [**39]  Although Atterbury was a toxic-tort case, we follow the reasoning of the Atterbury  [*609]  court and federal cases like it because we believe those cases properly utilize Texas's guiding rules and principles regarding the reliability of expert testimony. 29  Under Atterbury's logic, if it is proven that a chemical generally causes a particular illness (general causation), only then would a properly conducted and explained differential diagnosis be relevant to show that the chemical caused the illness in the plaintiff (specific causation). See  id., 978 S.W.2d at 200; accord  Raynor v. Merrell Pharms., Inc., 323 U.S. App. D.C. 23, 104 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding doctor's causation opinion based on differential diagnosis was properly deemed inadmissible, when, among other things, no reliable evidence first proved general causation). This is because a differential diagnosis presumes that chemical X can cause condition Y generally, but does not itself so prove. \n  [**40]  Dr. Miller's testimony provided nothing outside his differential diagnosis except the temporal proximity of the naphtha fumes to Anderson's symptoms. Dr. Miller admitted that he was not a toxicologist, did not know what chemicals comprised naphtha, and had read no literature connecting naphtha and BOOP. 30  Although both Dr. Miller and Dr. Wilson testified that the lack of naphtha/BOOP studies did not necessarily preclude a causal relationship, a lack of scientific evidence cannot excuse imposing liability without proof of causation. See  Austin, 25 S.W.3d at 292 (citing Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 727-28). Both medical experts further testified that BOOP was idiopathic about a third of the time, with the exception of several identified causes, none of which was known to be naphtha. Accordingly, Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis, no matter how reliable the trial court impliedly found it to be, could at most show specific causation. See  Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 199, 200-01; accord  Raynor, 104 F.3d at 1375-76; Cavallo, 892 F. Supp. at 771-72 (excluding expert's testimony when supported only by differential [**41]  diagnosis, but lacking principles and methods of toxicology); see also Sanders at 122-24, 130 ("The opinions that require the [differential diagnosis] expert to 'rule in before ruling out' are, in our view, correct."); Brown-Gates at 849-66. Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis merely presumed that naphtha could be a source of BOOP generally, then eliminated other possible sources of Anderson's BOOP until only naphtha was left. Thus, because Dr. Miller's diagnosis simply presumed that naphtha could cause BOOP, that diagnosis, without more, would not be reliable to show general causation, i.e., that naphtha can cause BOOP generally. See, e.g., Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 199, 200-01. \n  \n D. The Result \n The very nature of Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis would limit that diagnosis to proving [**42]  specific causation. Furthermore, Anderson failed to meet his burden to show that Dr. Miller's diagnosis could also be reliable as to general causation. In the toxic-tort context, a plaintiff must establish general causation for a differential diagnosis to be relevant to show  [*610]  specific causation. See, e.g., Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 200; Raynor, 104 F.3d at 1376. Accordingly, the trial court will have abused its discretion in admitting Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis, and we will sustain Coastal's first issue, if the remaining record does not also contain general-causation evidence that is reliable under Daubert/Robinson/Jordan. \n We note that our dissenting colleagues join the opinion thus far; however, they part ways on the remaining issue of whether the record contains reliable general- causation evidence. \n  \n E. The Sufficiency and Reliability of the General-Causation Evidence on Which Anderson Relies \n In its second issue, Coastal claims there was legally insufficient evidence of medical causation to support the jury's verdict. We review the remaining record for sufficient evidence of general causation. We apply the reliability test [**43]  as articulated in Daubert/Robinson/Jordan in our sufficiency review as well. 31  Austin, 25 S.W.3d at 284-87 (citing Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712). \n  [**44]  Anderson argues there was legally sufficient evidence of causation under the Jones Act's "featherweight" causation standard. Anderson further argues other evidence in the record constituted legally sufficient evidence of causation. Anderson refers us to "evidence that came from the various doctor's [Dr. Brown's] reports, the exhibits (particularly the MSDS), and the lay testimony [of timing]." \n First, the Jones Act's "featherweight" causation standard cannot transform no evidence into some evidence. The proper focus is not on the causation burden of proof, but on whether the expert opinion testimony is reliable in the first place. As noted above, if expert opinion testimony is unreliable, it is no evidence, not even a feather's weight. See  Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712, 713 ("The testimony of an expert is generally opinion testimony. Whether it rises to the level of evidence is determined under our rules of evidence, including Rule 702 . . . . If the expert's scientific testimony is not reliable, it is not evidence."). \n Second, Anderson did not present Dr. Brown (or his differential-diagnosis notes) as his causation expert, and Dr. Brown's notes came [**45]  in, along with all the medical records, as exhibits to Dr. Miller's deposition testimony presented at trial. Even if Dr. Brown's differential diagnosis (as stated in the medical records, discharge summary and other notes) could nonetheless be considered expert testimony, it, like Dr. Miller's, could show at most specific causation.  \n Third, the evidence presented here revealed that BOOP has several possible causes and is often idiopathic. General experience and common sense simply do not enable a fair understanding of either specific or general causation under these circumstances. Accordingly, expert testimony was required. Anderson offered no additional expert testimony showing that, generally, naphtha can cause BOOP. Similarly,  [*611]  no expert established that Dr. Brown's diagnostic records, the naphtha MSDS, 32  or any other non-expert evidence on which Anderson now relies met the appropriate Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiry as to general causation. It is this evidentiary gap that is fatal to Anderson's claims. \n  [**46]   \n Put another way, if Anderson had produced only Dr. Brown's differential diagnosis (as stated in the medical records, discharge summary, and other notes), the naphtha MSDS, and Dr. Wilson's statement that chemical pneumonia can cause BOOP, would he have carried his Daubert/Robinson/Jordan burden? He would not. Cf.  Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 717-28 (overturning jury verdict based on various experts' causation opinions and explaining type of specific, detailed showing needed to carry one's burden under Robinson and Rule 702). How, then, can those same evidentiary fragments survive the sufficiency challenge made here and below? They cannot. It was Anderson's burden to provide expert testimony linking these evidentiary pieces together through the lens of Daubert/Robinson/Jordan. See  Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718 (proponent's burden); Allen, 796 S.W.2d at 763 (expert testimony required). Anderson failed to meet this burden. \n Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Dr. Miller's specific-causation testimony when the record also lacked general-causation testimony by an expert applying inquiries like those under [**47]  Daubert/Robinson/Jordan. See  Atterbury, 978 S.W.2d at 199-200, 203 (holding toxic-tort plaintiff must prove both specific and general causation to prevail). Thus, there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Anderson's naphtha exposure "played any part, even the slightest" in causing his BOOP. See  Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at 406.  \n  \n We sustain Coastal's first issue. Because we sustain Coastal's first issue, we must also sustain its second issue. \n  \n Because Coastal's first and second issues are dispositive of the appeal, we need not address the remaining issues. \n  \n V. Conclusion \n The United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Texas, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals have repeatedly emphasized that the suggested inquiries to determine the reliability of an expert's opinion are to be used flexibly and are not exclusive.  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S. Ct. at 2797; accord  Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 141-42, 150-51, 119 S. Ct. at 1171, 1175-76; Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 557; Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 561. \n We emphasize that a trial [**48]  court may also consider other factors, not previously suggested, that are germane to an expert's qualifications and field of expertise in determining the reliability of proffered expert opinion testimony. The "methods of proving reliability will vary, depending upon the field of expertise." Nenno, 970 S.W.2d at 561. A trial court, "in discharging its duty as gatekeeper must determine how the reliability of particular testimony is to be assessed." Hernandez, 53 S.W.3d at 752 (citing Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726). Trial courts, functioning in their role as gatekeepers, have wide latitude in admitting reliable expert testimony and excluding unreliable expert testimony. We respect the discretion of trial court judges in performing their gatekeeping function and will not disturb their rulings  [*612]  on the reliability of expert testimony unless it appears from the record they acted without reference to pertinent guiding rules or principles. See  Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 558. \n Although we respect the discretion of trial courts in performing their gatekeeping function, we must conclude, in this case, that the trial court abused that [**49]  discretion in admitting Dr. Miller's specific-causation testimony when there was no general-causation testimony by an expert. Thus, there was legally insufficient evidence in this case that exposure to naphtha played any part, "even the slightest," in causing Anderson's BOOP. \n We reverse and render judgment in favor of Coastal. \n Terry Jennings \n Justice  \n Concur by: Scott Brister \n Concur \n  \n  \n For the first time since judges were admonished to guard the gate leading to the expert witness stand, this Court must review whether some evidence connects a particular chemical exposure to a particular disease. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1  and Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, 2  our highest courts set out in detail the standards we must apply. But the Court balks, choosing instead to follow its own brand-new standards. As an intermediate appellate court, this is not our role. Thus, I write separately. \n  [**50]  I. What Daubert and Havner Require \n Every court superior to ours (and there are at least three) has adopted a specific list of factors that courts "should consider" when evaluating scientific medical testimony. 3  The Court considers these factors only long enough to reject them. It is true these factors may not apply in all cases,  [*613]  but we can hardly ignore them when -- just as in Daubert and Havner -- scientific testimony attempts to link a chemical exposure to a medical condition. \n Dr. David Miller was Anderson's sole expert witness on causation. He testified that Anderson's lung disease -- bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (known by its unfortunate acronym "BOOP") -- was caused by naphtha, even though he did not know the chemicals in naphtha, the level of Anderson's exposure, [**51]  or any medical literature that connected the two. He stated two reasons. \n First, he relied on the temporal connection between Anderson's exposure and his disease. Such post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc 4  reasoning is sometimes correct, sometimes fallacious. Proximity in time may suggest proximate cause when the harm from exposure is immediate, direct, and obvious, such as coughing, watery eyes, or (in Anderson's case) headaches and nausea. But when the alleged harm is cancer, a birth defect, or BOOP -- conditions whose development may be delayed, indirect, or largely unknown -- something more is required. 5  \n  [**52]  Second, he used a "differential diagnosis," based partly on medical tests, but mostly on what Anderson told him. The Court finds this "differential diagnosis" reliable. For several reasons, I am not so sure. \n First, this was no diagnosis. Differential diagnosis is a "determination of which of two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which the patient is suffering." 6  But there is only one way to diagnose BOOP -- a biopsy. 7  [**53]  Dr. Miller's process of elimination led him to suspect a generalized pneumonia, but only the biopsy diagnosed Anderson's disease as BOOP. Maybe courts should refuse to scrutinize differential diagnoses when they are used "to prescribe medical treatment with potential life-or-death consequences." But that's not what happened here. 8  \n Second, Dr. Miller's opinion was critical for something else -- Anderson's million-dollar claim against his employer. 9  To the extent his opinion relied on objective medical tests, this is fair game -- let Coastal disprove these if it can. But the opinion  [*614]  relied heavily on Anderson's truthfulness. 10  [**54]  Doctors are no experts at that. 11  \n Third, no evidence shows that Dr. Miller's reliance upon temporal proximity and a process of elimination is a reliable method used by scientists to establish what causes BOOP, especially when a new "cause" is involved. This is demonstrated by applying the factors Daubert and Havner say we "should consider": \n . Testing. One could test whether this methodology is a valid way to find new causes of BOOP, or whether naphtha causes BOOP, but apparently no one has done so; \n . Peer review and publication. Neither Dr. Miller's methodology nor conclusion have ever been published or reviewed by his peers; 12  \n  [**55]  . Potential rate of error. For the above reasons, this is unknown; \n . General acceptance. Without citation to any medical studies, there appears to be no general acceptance of this testimony from other members of the medical community; 13  and \n . Non-judicial use. As previously mentioned, the primary use of this testimony was Anderson's lawsuit -- it had no effect on his treatment. \n Moreover, the peculiar facts here make a differential diagnosis particularly subjective and unreliable. As noted in Havner, there is a relationship between mathematical percentages and the burden of proof. 14  Dr. Miller admitted that the cause in about a third of all BOOP cases was unknown, exceeding the incidence of any other known cause. Thus, even if Anderson had one of the [**56]  conditions known to be associated with BOOP (say, a viral infection or arthritis), without knowing more it is hard to see how he could prove this cause was "more probable" than all the other unknown causes. A probability smaller than one-third simply cannot also be more probable than one-third. \n Finally, in this case there are both unknown and ubiquitous causes, both of which it is impossible to "rule out." For the former, one cannot develop a checklist of symptoms, exposures, or medical history to exclude them. For the latter, one cannot exclude something that everyone is  [*615]  exposed to. In this case, Dr. Miller never ruled out nitrogen oxides (admitting they were everywhere), or the unknown causes that predominate in BOOP cases; he simply ignored them. This is not proper methodology. 15  \n  [**57]  Differential diagnoses may sometimes meet the Daubert standards. If the percentage of unknown causes is small, a known cause may well be "more likely." 16  If there are only four causes of a disease, ruling out three may tell us all we need to know. But ruling out three proves little if the number of causes is twenty, or unknown. Because Dr. Miller's elimination of some causes in Anderson's case cannot tell us (in reasonable probability) the actual cause, it is no evidence of causation, specific or otherwise. 17  \n II. The Court's New Differential-Diagnosis Rule \n Instead of testing Dr. Miller's "differential [**58]  diagnosis" by the factors Daubert and Havner say we should consider, the Court holds that no differential diagnosis need comply with them. This stretches "flexible" too far. 18  Not all fields of expertise follow scientific principles or have peer-reviewed journals, but that is no license to ignore these factors in fields that do. \n The Court rejects the Daubert and Havner factors because they are "hard science," opting instead for a "soft science" approach to differential diagnoses. I may be mistaken, but I believe most scientists that fly on airplanes, go to the doctor, or get sued for a million dollars would expect the science to be pretty "hard." True, doctors in a clinical setting may sometimes have to guess. Exigencies may require them to try certain treatments before they know what will [**59]  work. But the Court does not explain why these lower standards make them reliable in court. \n Instead, the Court declares a new test -- differential diagnoses are admissible if "properly conducted and explained" or "properly relied upon and/or utilized." This is not much of a test. At the least, it is a very subjective one -- who is to say what is proper? The Daubert and Havner tests contain objective standards to ensure reliability; the Court's test returns us to the days of "flexible" science. 19  \n  [**60]   \n There is (as the Court notes) considerable disagreement about whether and to what extent differential diagnoses meet the requirements of Daubert and Havner. In part, this is because they come in many varieties and circumstances. For example,  [*616]  excluding potential causes by laboratory tests is surely more reliable than excluding them based on subjective observations. Relying on a patient's reported history may be reliable when the risk factors carry no moral or legal baggage with them, but less reliable when they do. And the context of the diagnosis (whether for treatment, for insurance coverage, or for litigation) may also affect reliability. 20  Given the unsettled state of the law, it would be wiser to decide this case on its facts, rather than rushing to the universal conclusion that differential diagnoses establish specific but not general causation. 21  \n  [**61]   \n The Court's commitment to and analysis of differential diagnoses is impressive, especially as very little of it comes from the parties' briefs. 22  "No one doubts the utility of medical histories in general or the process by which doctors rule out some known causes of disease in order to finalize a diagnosis." 23  But the question is not whether doctors in general ought to use differential diagnoses; the question is whether scientists recognize differential diagnosis as a proper method for determining a new cause of a disease. 24  This question ought to be tested by the Daubert and Havner factors, and ought to depend on the facts of each case. \n  [**62]  III. The Court's New General Causation Rule \n But the Court's opinion has something to trouble everyone. While defendants may be surprised to learn that differential diagnoses are presumptively reliable, plaintiffs are now informed they must prove both general and specific causation in all toxic tort cases. Neither party asked for this; indeed, they never mention "general causation" in their four briefs. The Texas Supreme Court has never stated such a rule; Havner notes only that plaintiffs "sometimes" offer general causation evidence when they cannot present reliable evidence of specific causation. 25  In this case, Anderson made no such offer, because there were no epidemiological studies that would allow him to do so. I would not apply standards to his case that he never attempted to meet. \n It is the work of a moment for a defendant to file a no-evidence motion demanding proof of general causation. The Court's opinion short-circuits any argument [**63]  that such proof is not required in every toxic tort case. General causation usually means epidemiological studies -- not  [*617]  just one, but several. 26  These do not exist with respect to many toxins and torts, and are very expensive to create. \n  \n Moreover, the term "toxic torts" covers a lot of ground - from asbestos and breast implants to refinery explosions, vaccinations, and food poisoning. There is a logical appeal to requiring every plaintiff to prove that an alleged causation chain can actually occur. But if asbestos fibers are directly found in a plaintiff's lungs, or thirty people eating at the same restaurant get sick at once, I hesitate to hold that each of them must prove "general causation" simply because their tort implicates a toxin. \n And why limit this proclamation to toxic tort cases?  [**64]  "It would be a mistake to argue that the causal issues in toxic tort cases are fundamentally different from those presented in other tort cases." 27  Why not require plaintiffs to prove general causation in auto accident and slip-and-fall cases, too? \n I hope the Court's new rule is correct, but it may prove to be very expensive for some litigants if it is not. Without considering the circumstances in all of these cases, and without either party asking us to take such a step, I would not go that far here. \n IV. The Dissent and the Documents \n The primary issue the parties briefed and argued was whether, even without Dr. Miller's testimony, scattered references in the medical records and a product sheet about naphtha were enough to establish causation in this case. 28  The [**65]  dissent would affirm on this basis - having guarded the gate and found Anderson's expert wanting, they would permit him to proceed to verdict with documents as his only escort. The majority disagrees, but hardly explains why. \n There is no question these documents were admissible; they just were not enough. 29  The primary reason is that they cannot independently meet the Daubert and Havner factors that serve as a predicate for reliability. None of the notations in Anderson's hospital records indicate the methodology used. None indicate support from medical studies or general acceptance in the medical community. Only one indicates how or why the author reached his conclusion, and that one relies only on anecdotal evidence. 30  Most do not even  [*618]  mention naphtha [**66]  or BOOP. If all that is needed to avoid the standards set by Daubert and Havner is a note in the medical records that "A caused B," then there has been much ado about nothing. \n  [**67]  Similarly, the naphtha product safety data sheet states only that overexposure to naphtha can cause (among many other problems) inflammation of the lungs. Because it does not mention BOOP, it provides no information about relative risk, required exposure level, or time of onset. 31  This is not enough to prove causation. 32  \n In addition, Anderson's argument fails because it violates a rule much older than Daubert -- unless medical causation is within the common knowledge of laymen, expert testimony is required. 33  There are several reasons why documents cannot replace an expert. \n  [**68]  First, none of them are under oath. If Anderson had requested a trial continuance due to health problems, his doctor's opinions would have to have been sworn. 34  It is hard to believe his doctor's opinion on causation -- the critical issue supporting his million-dollar verdict -- requires something less. \n Second, it is too easy to reach the wrong conclusion by picking and choosing parts of a document and using them out of context. Anderson points to several conclusory statements in the medical records that his lung inflammation was caused by his chemical exposure. But he skips over the discharge summary, which relates his shortness of breath to "exposure to Benzine [sic], Toluene, asbestos and naphtha." As these entries show, hospital records often recite a working diagnosis or a patient's version of his medical history; this does not mean they are intended to be independent opinions [**69]  of causation. 35  Nor does the context of such notes indicate they are based on reasonable medical probability. 36  \n Third, Anderson's use of these documents shows the wisdom of the rule that bars admission of "learned treatises" in place of expert testimony. 37  By applying the reasoning of lawyers to the language of doctors, Anderson says we should adopt the following reasoning: \n . certain chemicals (but not naphtha) have been shown to cause lung inflammation that can cause BOOP; \n . naphtha can cause lung inflammation; \n . therefore, naphtha-related lung inflammation must also cause BOOP. \n But according to this reasoning, all chemicals that cause inflammation (and there  [*619]  are many) must cause BOOP. The medical evidence is quite the contrary. \n  [**70]  If we drop the requirement for an escorting expert, we will soon end up with "science" that scientists can prove wrong. For example, Coastal's expert, Dr. Keith Wilson, testified without contradiction that tobacco (for once) is not associated with this lung disease. Of course, tobacco smoke contains chemicals, which undoubtedly can inflame the lungs. Thus, tobacco must cause BOOP -- except that it doesn't. \n Conclusion \n Someday, medical science may find that naphtha exposure causes BOOP. But as far as we know now, it is just as likely to find that it does not. This case cannot be indefinitely postponed in the interim. In our system of justice, if a fact cannot be proved one way or the other, the party bearing the burden of proof loses. We cannot be hasty to impose liability when scientifically reliable evidence is unavailable. 38  \n Similarly, someday our highest courts may decide all toxic tort plaintiffs must prove both general and specific causation, [**71]  and that a proper differential diagnosis always proves the latter but never the former. But unlike this appeal, those questions do not have to be decided today. In our system of justice, courts should answer only the questions before them, and leave broader pronouncements to future cases. We cannot be hasty to impose rules that may require backpedaling later. \n For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court. \n Scott Brister 39  \n Justice  \n Dissent by: Murry B. Cohen \n Dissent \n  \n  \n I join parts I through IV(D) of Justice Jennings's opinion for the en banc Court. However, I disagree with part IV(E) of that opinion and thus with the conclusion and judgment. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. \n  \n Sufficiency of Evidence Other Than Dr. Miller's Causation Opinion \n I agree with the majority [**72]  that Anderson had to prove causation by expert testimony. Unlike the majority, however, I would hold that Dr. Brown's written diagnosis and testimony by Coastal's Dr. Wilson, along with the naphtha material safety data sheet ("MSDS"), supplied the general causation link that Dr. Miller's opinion lacked. \n  \n 1. Additional Comments on the Standard of Review \n Under the Jones Act, we inquire whether the evidence reasonably justifies the conclusion that Coastal's negligence played any part, "even the slightest," in producing the injury at issue. E.g., Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406 (Tex. 1998). It would be hard to imagine a standard of review more favorable to a plaintiff. Certainly, this standard of review is more favorable than that under the traditional evidentiary standards: under the Jones Act, the jury enjoys complete discretion in deciding factual liability issues, and we uphold the verdict if it is supported by some, "even the slightest" evidence. 1  Id. at 406; Offshore Pipelines  [*620]  v. Schooley, 984 S.W.2d 654, 663 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.). \n  \n  [**73]  2. Dr. Brown's Opinion \n  Coastal did not sufficiently object under Robinson and Havner to Dr. Brown's medical records; 2  thus, Coastal may not now challenge the use of Dr. Brown's causation opinions within those records to support general or specific causation. See  Maritime Overseas Corp, 971 S.W.2d at 409 ("To preserve a complaint that scientific evidence is unreliable and thus, no evidence, a party must object to the evidence before trial or when the evidence is offered."). \n  [**74]  I set out Dr. Brown's initial file note of September 27, 1994 in full: \n [Anderson] presented a long history, very carefully given, that he was in a foreign port when they took on a load of naphtha. The fumes were extremely heavy and gagged him, and caused him kind of a respiratory type breathing problem that resulted in some chest pain. He had a hacking cough, which is documented in the communications. He had a diagnosis of tracheobronchitis, which is documented in the communications sent to me. \n Here in my office I got a history that he was a long time employee of Reynolds Metals, never any serious illnesses. He had a hernia operation in 1971. There is no history of any on the job illnesses that I know of. Socially, he doesn't drink coffee or tea, and he does not smoke or use tobacco products. Only upon occasion does he drink any alcohol whatsoever. As I listened carefully, the man related that he had been confined to his room and "quarantined" for six days. It got more difficult for him to breathe, and he had progressively more chest pain. He also went on to relate  [*621]  that they took on a load and that the fumes were very difficult to tolerate and caused a lot of bronchospasm,  [**75]  coughing and chest discomfort. \n He got to my practice in sort of a circuitous route, in that Dr. Vela here in Corpus Christi was unable to see him, and they wanted somebody who had dealt with [text whited out] in the past. Having dealt with high chain aromatic hydrocarbons since the early 70's, when I was the medical director at Coastal States Gas Producing here in Corpus Christi, I became familiar with the types of pneumonia that this particular product could cause. \n Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat revealed a bright red pharynx and bright red ears. This man was using the accessory strap muscles of respiration and appeared quite ill. Otherwise the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat were normal. Ausculation of the lungs revealed that he was barely moving any air at all, and it sounded as if he might have some sort of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. I went on to ask about asbestos, and the only history I got of asbestos was that he had worked at Reynolds Martin for 30 years and had had chest films every year, and that nothing had ever come up abnormal. \n Today we did an EKG, which revealed a sinus rhythm with a right ventricular conduction delay. He had a pulmonary [**76]  function testing, which revealed extremely restricted FEV- 1 of only about 50% of predicted [illegible] and extremely restricted air flow. A chest x-ray revealed a fleecy peribronchiolar infiltrate around the hilum of the lungs and almost a consolidated pneumonia in the lung bases bilaterally, but more pronounced on the right than the left. I went back and re-examined the patient and found out that he was actually a little bit more hypoxic than I felt. At this point I felt like I needed to back up [sic] the expertise of the hospital and the pulmonologist. \n My impression was that he had an aspiration/chemical type pneumonia secondary to the breathing of a high chain aromatic hydrocarbon such as naphtha. The history of [whited out] contamination I figured probably would have resulted in a dead patient. Long standing exposure to asbestos, if he had it, and I am not sure he did, would result in markedly different looking chest film, which would be read as asbestosis. At any rate, I felt that the man's wellness was in jeopardy and that I needed the support of the hospital and consultation of Dr. David Miller, local pulmonologist.  \n I think the prognosis is guarded at this point.  \n  [**77]  (Emphasis added.) The discharge summary that Dr. Brown co-signed also states in part as follows: \n Patient was admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath and due to his history of exposure to naphtha from working as a merchant marine. Patient was also exposed to asbestos from working at Reynolds Aluminum Foil Plant locally for 30 years. He was exposed to Naphtha while working as a merchant marine for the past 4 years. Upon admission, a chest x-ray was done which showed diffuse infiltrates in both lungs, most severe in the lower right lobe consistent with pneumonitis 3  secondary to chemical exposure. CT scan done with contrast to evaluate interstitial lung disease showed fibrosis in both  [*622]  lung bases with a predominantly peripheral distribution. Possibilities include usual interstitial pneumonitis secondary to rheumatologic disease, asbestosis is less likely due to the absent [sic] of pleural plaques a condition that can result in this case. Other conditions that can result in basilar fibrosis are scleroderma and chronic aspiration. Repeat chest exam done on the 1st of October 1994, showed a worsening of the right base, preexisting infiltrates and they are still [**78]  present. Repeat chest exam on the 3rd of October showed unimproved bibasilar pneumonia and no new complications. Repeat on the 5th showed no new complications. Lung biopsy which was performed on the 30th of September 1994, path report shows diagnosis as previously stated. Biopsy was done on the right lower and middle lung biopsy and showed bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia [BOOP]. \n (Emphasis added.) In various other documents, Dr. Brown reiterates in shorthand his diagnosis of BOOP secondary to toxic exposure. 4  \n  [**79]  Contrary to Coastal's argument, Dr. Brown's diagnostic records are not like those in Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye. 907 S.W.2d 497 (Tex. 1995). In Crye, neither a Robinson/Havner nor a Jones Act case, the Court held that medical records were no evidence that Polysporin spray caused frostbite.  Id. at 500. But there, the uncontroverted evidence showed the plaintiff had a physical reaction to the spray that her own expert testified would not indicate frostbite, and the medical records were mere recitations of medical history or were based on lay or flawed expert opinions, including an expert opinion based on assumed facts that varied materially from the actual, undisputed facts.  Id. at 499-500. Here, in contrast, Dr. Brown was the first to diagnose causation; he based that initial diagnosis on what approximates a differential diagnosis and on his lengthy personal experience (including as medical director of Coastal States Gas Producing Company) with pneumoniae due to high- chain aromatic hydrocarbons; and he reiterated (albeit summarily) this causation diagnosis after Anderson underwent multiple medical tests. Expert causation [**80]  testimony must rest in reasonable medical probability, but reasonable probability is determined from the opinion's context and substance, not by semantics or a particular term's use.  Id. at 500. Dr. Brown's diagnosis meets this test. This is so even if Anderson did not present Dr. Brown as his trial expert because we must consider the entire record in a sufficiency review. Dr. Brown's written diagnosis is some evidence of specific causation, because it is a differential diagnosis, and also of general causation, because Coastal did not properly object to this aspect of Dr. Brown's diagnosis. See  Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at 409. \n 3. Other Evidence of General Causation \n Besides Dr. Brown's diagnosis, the pathology report comments that multiple conditions can, in general, be "associated with" BOOP, including toxic industrial fumes, drugs, infections, chronic aspiration, collagen vascular disease, bronchial obstruction, and "idiopathic." It is thus significant that the naphtha MSDS, which federal regulations required Coastal to post on this vessel, states "pneumonitis" is a potential effect of overexposure to naphtha; 5   [*623]  that Coastal's counsel agreed [**81]  at oral argument that "pneumonitis" is the same thing as "pneumonia"; 6  and that Dr. Wilson, Coastal's own expert, testified that chemical pneumonia, which Drs. Brown and Miller concluded Anderson first had, can cause BOOP. 7  These were Coastal's documents, Coastal's admission, and Coastal's expert. I consider these to be highly significant pieces of evidence. \n  [**82]  For example, federal regulations require an MSDS for "hazardous chemicals," which are defined in pertinent part as any chemical that is a "health hazard." 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200(c) (2001). "Health hazard" is defined as "a chemical for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees." Id. The chemical's manufacturer or importer, or an employer that opts to do its own testing, 8  must "identify and consider the available scientific evidence concerning such [health] hazards." The regulation further declares that "evidence which is statistically significant and which is based on at least one positive study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles is considered to be sufficient to establish a hazardous effect if the result of the study meets the definitions of health hazards in this section," noting also that the regulation's Appendix B must be consulted for criteria to be used in the chemical's evaluation, the data to be reported, and the chemical's listing as hazardous. Id. at (c), (d)(2). Appendix [**83]  B provides, among other things, that the results of any studies that "are designed and conducted according to established scientific principles, and which report statistically significant conclusions regarding the health effects of a chemical, shall be a sufficient basis for a hazard determination and reported on any [MSDS]." Id., Appendix B, 4. \n We do not know who compiled this naphtha MSDS or exactly what testing procedures that entity used. It could have been The Coastal Corporation, whose name, address, and phone number appeared at the top of the MSDS, or one of the 17 apparently related corporations also listed there. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200(c), (d)(1)-(2), (g)(1) (2001) (allowing the chemical's manufacturer or importer, or an employer that opts to do its own testing, to conduct the chemical's testing and develop the MSDS; also defining "employer" as "a  [*624]  person [**84]  engaged in a business where chemicals are either used, distributed, or are produced for use or distribution, including a contractor or subcontractor"). Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, we should assume the MSDS was done by some Coastal corporate body. But even without this assumption, whichever entity compiled this MSDS had to meet the above regulations in determining the chemical's health hazards. This fact makes the MSDS a sufficiently reliable link in the general causation chain, especially given (1) that that link was Coastal's own business document and (2) our "even the slightest evidence" standard of review. \n  \n 4. Conclusion \n The trial judge would not have abused his discretion if he impliedly determined that (1) specific causation was reliably proved by Dr. Miller's opinion and (2) general causation was reliably proved by Dr. Brown's written diagnosis and Coastal's own expert and document. 9  Applying the Jones Act "featherweight" causation standard, I would accordingly hold there is legally sufficient evidence that Anderson's naphtha exposure "played any part, even the slightest" in causing his BOOP. See  Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at 406. [**85]  I would thus overrule Coastal's issues one and two and reach its remaining issues. \n For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the en banc Court's judgment. \n Murry B.
