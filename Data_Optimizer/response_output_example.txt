Background:
The appellant church, Macedonia Baptist Church, faced a case where they were sued by an injured member, Nora Gibson, and her husband Milton Gibson, who sought recovery for injuries Nora sustained from a side flash from lightning. The incident occurred while she was leaving worship services at the church during a lightning storm on August 21, 1988. The lightning struck the church's lightning rod and traveled down its grounding cables, one of which was in close proximity to Nora when the side flash occurred and injured her. The lightning protection system had been installed by church members who had deviated from the provided instructions in its installation. Macedonia Baptist Church, incorporated under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act, claimed that as a non-profit membership corporation, it should have defenses similar to those of unincorporated associations, which allegedly protected them from suits by members. However, the court held that a corporation is a separate legal entity from its members, and individual members retain the right to sue the corporation as outsiders would. Macedonia challenged the jury's finding of proximate cause, arguing that the injury was caused by an act of God as a result of the natural occurrence of lightning, and therefore they could not be held responsible. However, the evidence presented showed that the church was aware of past lightning strikes and the associated dangers. The installation of the lightning protection system deviated from the design which intentionally placed ground wires away from walkways to avoid such accidents. An additional ground tackled concerns the exclusion of testimony by a church member, Shirley Stark, caused by the church's failure to designate her as a witness with relevant knowledge in a timely manner. Macedonia also claimed errors in jury argument, with complaints about several points made by the Gibsons’ attorney, but the court dealt with these complaints individually, finding most of them either waived, invalid, or not requiring reversal. Lastly, Macedonia requested a new trial based on newly discovered evidence but the court found that the evidence was not sufficient to produce a different result as it was cumulative and the existing trial testimony had already covered similar points.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the injured member Nora Gibson and her husband. The church's assertion that it should have protections similar to unincorporated associations will be rejected as the court will hold that when a corporation, even a non-profit one, is formed, it becomes a separate legal entity and members have standing to sue it in the same manner as non-members. The argument of the church that the injury was an act of God and thereby relieving it from liability for the lightning injury will fail, as the court will find that the injury was a direct result of the church's actions; specifically, the improper installation of the lightning protection system will be identified as the proximate cause of the injury. The testimony and evidence presented regarding the church's knowledge of past lightning strikes, the recognized danger, and the deviation from standard installation procedures will serve as a basis for the court finding foreseeable risk and causation. The exclusion of Shirley Stark’s testimony will be upheld due to the church's procedural failure to properly designate her as a witness with relevant facts. Given the due process in law, the court's discretion to exclude improper or undesignated testimony is to be respected unless there is a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion, which will not be demonstrated in this case. The church's complaints regarding improper jury argument will be dismissed, as they will be considered either not legally significant, adequately dealt with during the trial (such as by objections or court instructions), or waived due to lack of proper objection or preservation for appellate review. The request for a new trial by the church on the grounds of newly discovered evidence will not be granted. The church's inability to show that the evidence could likely produce a different result—in part because the evidence was merely cumulative and failed to outweigh that provided during the trial—will make it not possible to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion. Overall, the church's grounds for appeal will be deemed insufficient to alter the outcome of the trial court’s decision. The court's analysis will indicate that the actions of the church were the proximate cause of the injuries sustained, and the trial process did not contain reversible errors. As such, the lower court's judgment in favor of the injured member and her husband will be upheld.
