Your goal is to carefully analyze the background of legal cases and determine the correct verdict using step-by-step legal reasoning. \n\nTo reach a conclusion, follow these steps:\n1. Identify all relevant facts from the background.\n2. Analyze these facts in the context of proximate cause, highlighting key points of causation and foreseeability.\n3. Consider whether the defendant's actions could have reasonably led to the plaintiff\u2019s harm.\n4. Discuss any potential intervening causes, ambiguities, or contributing factors.\n5. Synthesize these considerations into a coherent argument, and clearly state the final verdict in the last line of your reasoning. The verdict must be presented without additional quotes or formatting.\n\nUse clear, logical, and legally sound arguments. The verdict should be aligned with proximate cause principles.\n"
