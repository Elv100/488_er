Background:
Members of the Assembly of God Church were attending evening prayer services on January 21, 1998, when lightning struck a nearby pole-mounted transformer, resulting in a power outage at the church. Pastor D.G. Council called 9-1-1 and was told that Texas Utilities Electric Company (T.U.) would restore power as soon as possible. The pastor escorted everyone out, and two men checked the church’s exterior, confirming no structural damage. No one checked if breakers had tripped inside the church. On the morning of January 22, Council arrived at the church, finding the power was still out, and he went to his office to work.

In the evening of January 22, the church's music director, Gary Graves, found the power was still out and informed Council, who then called T.U.’s emergency line requesting notification upon power restoration. A T.U. crew led by senior serviceman Larry Crocker went to the church later that evening, observed damage believed to be from the lightning strike, and proceeded to replace transformers, a fuse cut out, and insulators. The customer service representative had agreed to call Council upon power restoration, but ultimately neither Crocker nor the customer service representative made that call. Power was restored around 12:33 a.m., January 23, after voltage checks at the meter base showed proper levels, and the lights in the church and parking lot came on.

Within an hour after the crew left, a fire broke out, destroying the sanctuary. The church sued T.U., alleging negligence and gross negligence in repairing the electrical equipment and restoring power without notifying the church. T.U. filed a motion for summary judgment claiming the church had no evidence that T.U.'s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the damages and that the church’s negligence claim was precluded by a Tariff for Electric Service that limited T.U.'s liability unless its negligence was the sole proximate cause. The Tariff also stipulated T.U. was not responsible for damages caused by acts of God or failure of protective devices. The trial court granted T.U.’s motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds, leading the church to appeal.

Verdict:
As the appeals court's decision will be based on existing legal standards and the evidence presented, it will affirm the trial court's summary judgment in favor of T.U. upon evaluating the three points of error raised by the appellant. The court will note that tariffs have the force of law and are presumed reasonable, thus putting the burden of proof on the appellant to show the Tariff for Electric Service’s unreasonableness. However, since the Tariff has been approved by the Public Utility Commission (P.U.C.), the court will find the limitation of T.U.'s liability to instances of sole proximate causation reasonable, particularly for economic damages. Consequently, the court will determine that the appellant has not provided sufficient evidence that T.U.'s actions were the sole proximate cause of the fire and resulting damage.

Furthermore, the court will likely reason that the notion of gross negligence requires evidence that T.U. was aware of the risk and acted with conscious indifference, which was not the case here. Additionally, no evidence will be found that the customer service representative or T.U.'s crew had any knowledge of downstream damage or that arcing could result from restoring power, nor that there was a standard operating procedure requiring notification before restoring power after a lightning strike. The court will also consider that the church had the responsibility under the Tariff to maintain their equipment and that multiple proximate causes (lightning, damaged wiring, failure to shut off equipment) were potential contributors to the damage, none of which could singularly be deemed the sole proximate cause.

As a result, the court will overrule all points of error asserted by the appellant and, with the use of established legal principles and exhaustive evaluation of the factual and procedural background, affirm the summary judgment that released T.U. from liability for the church's damages.
