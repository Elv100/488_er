Background:
Refugio Sanchez was employed as a "swamper" with Precision Drilling Holdings Company (Holdings), which involved aiding in the movement of oil and gas rigs. Holdings was separate from Precision Drilling Company, LP (Precision), yet both contractors were working on a jobsite operated by COG Operating LLC. On April 30, 2013, during a project to move Precision's Rig 105, Sanchez and fellow Holdings employees Ivan Torres and Austin Matejowsky were assigned to load a portable generator onto a truck and reposition it. Sanchez secured the generator using chains and rope, and Torres, who was tasked with driving, got behind the wheel. Matejowsky, positioned outside the truck, was actively directing Torres to back up the truck while also communicating with Precision's rig manager, Ricky Menard, about the placement of the generator. At that instant, the generator swung, causing Torres to lose control. Sanchez, who was holding onto the tag line attached to the generator, was drawn towards the truck. Matejowsky, still flagging Torres, did not notice the swinging generator or Sanchez's position. Consequently, as Sanchez stepped between the generator and the truck, the truck ran over his leg, resulting in severe injuries that led to amputation.

Sanchez brought a personal injury suit against Precision, alleging negligence in failing to maintain a safe work environment. However, the trial court granted Precision's motion for summary judgment on both traditional and no-evidence grounds, effectively dismissing Sanchez's suit without delineating the specific grounds for judgment.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of Precision, noting that Sanchez did not present sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between Precision's actions and his injuries. To overturn the summary judgment, Sanchez would have needed to offer at least a scintilla of evidence to demonstrate that Precision either directly contributed to the incident or failed to correct a hazardous condition that led to the accident. Sanchez's reliance on the expert report by Douglas W. Smith fails to meet this standard.

The report does not clearly articulate the specific failures by Precision, nor does it convincingly establish that any act or failure to act by Precision was a substantial factor in the accident. The nine contributing factors listed by Smith do not individually or collectively implicate Precision in a way that satisfies the legal requirements of cause-in-fact.

Given Sanchez's inability to demonstrate a necessary degree of causation, the court will rule that the trial court did not err in its decision to grant Precision's no-evidence summary judgment motion. The court will reject Sanchez's challenge and uphold the dismissal of his negligence claim against Precision, negating the need to delve into arguments regarding duty or breach. Thus, the final judgment will support Precision's position that the evidence presented by Sanchez was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding Precision's alleged negligence.
