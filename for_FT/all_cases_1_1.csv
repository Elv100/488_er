Background,Verdict
"Arturo Flores, a 66-year-old retired brake mechanic, worked from 1966 until his retirement in 2001, primarily in the automotive department at Sears in Corpus Christi. During his career, Flores handled several brands of brake pads, including those made by Borg-Warner. Specifically, from 1972-75, he used Borg-Warner pads on 5 to 7 of the approximately 20 brake jobs he performed weekly. Borg-Warner disc brake pads contained chrysotile asbestos fibers, which made up 7 to 28 percent of the pad's weight. Flores's job involved grinding these pads to prevent squealing, a process that produced dust which he inhaled in a small, confined space.

Flores developed asbestosis, a disease linked to asbestos exposure from his tenure as a brake mechanic. Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by asbestos fibers, which leads to progressive scarring of lung tissue. During the trial, Flores presented testimony from two experts. Dr. Dinah Bukowski, a pulmonologist, diagnosed Flores with asbestosis based on his work history and lung disease evidence. Dr. Barry Castleman, who specialized in toxic substance control, discussed the risks of asbestos exposure for brake mechanics and testified that brake mechanics could be exposed to asbestos by grinding or blowing out brake housings. Borg-Warner presented their expert, Dr. Kathryn Hale, a pulmonologist, who argued that Flores did not have asbestosis based on her examination and the criteria used to evaluate his condition.

At trial, the evidence did not indicate how much asbestos Flores inhaled while grinding brake pads over his career. Nor did it show what proportion of the inhaled respirable asbestos originated from Borg-Warner's products or that the quantity from Borg-Warner's products substantially contributed to his asbestosis.

The jury found Borg-Warner negligent and that their products' defects were a producing cause of Flores's injury. Borg-Warner was apportioned 37% of the causation. Flores was awarded various sums for damages, including compensation for physical impairment and pain and mental anguish, totaling $114,000, and $55,000 in exemplary damages due to malice. The trial court signed a judgment in accordance with the verdict, which Borg-Warner appealed.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, but Borg-Warner petitioned for review, arguing that a plaintiff claiming injury from an asbestos-containing product must meet the same causation standards as in other claims. The case then went to the Supreme Court of Texas for further review.","The Supreme Court of Texas, upon review, will focus on the legal sufficiency of the evidence pertaining to causation, which requires that a plaintiff prove that the defendant's product was a substantial factor in causing the harm. The dose-response relationship, a key concept in toxicology, is crucial here. It requires evidence of the amount of substance (dose) that entered Flores's body to evaluate whether the defendant's product contributed significantly to the development of asbestosis.

Without evidence about the dose of respirable asbestos fibers Flores was exposed to, especially originating from Borg-Warner's products, it is not possible for a jury to determine whether such exposure was substantial enough to cause Flores's disease. Additionally, the Court will consider that while exposure to asbestos-containing products can be a risk, the exposure must surpass a certain threshold to be deemed the cause of the disease.

Considering these factors, the Court is likely to conclude that the evidence presented at trial was inadequate to establish the substantial-factor causation required under Texas law. Thus, the Court will likely find that the causation standard applied by the lower courts was incorrect, and they will reverse the judgment of the appeals court and render judgment in favor of Borg-Warner because Flores did not meet the burden of showing that the asbestos dosage from Borg-Warner's products was sufficient to cause his asbestosis."
"The appellant, Jackson, a truck driver, filed a lawsuit against the appellee, Insurance Association, under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act, seeking damages for physical injuries sustained while performing his duties as a truck driver. Jackson's employer was a subscriber under the Compensation Act, with the defendant serving as the insurer. Jackson was on a multi-day haul when he suffered exposure to severe weather conditions, which he claimed caused his health issues. On the first day, he was caught in a rainstorm on an open prairie with no shelter from his truck to protect him. At night, he followed his employer's instructions for sleeping arrangements, only to find there was no shelter prepared for him, prompting him to sleep under an open shed. This resulted in him being soaked by another overnight rainstorm. The next day, while returning with his loaded truck, he was caught in another rainstorm, which led him to develop pneumonia and suffer swelling in a leg vein, leading to hospitalization and incapacity for work for over two months.

Jackson's application for compensation was rejected by the Texas State Industrial Board. He argued his injuries arose during employment; his employer's instructions subjected him to greater hazards than the general public; and that the injuries were not simply acts of God but rather the direct and natural result of his employment conditions. The insurer argued that Jackson's injuries did not fall within the Workmen's Compensation Act because they were not the result of an accident. The County Court of Wichita County sustained the insurer's general demurrer, prompting Jackson's appeal.","Upon review, the court will conclude that Jackson's injuries are compensable under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act. While typically injuries caused by acts of God are not compensable, an injury resulting from an act of God will be compensated if the performance of the employee’s duties exposed him to greater hazards from the act of God than what applies to the general public. Jackson's employment conditions, which lacked essential shelter or adequate sleeping quarters, exposed him to the severe climatic conditions which led to his injuries. The performance of Jackson’s duties in these conditions directly contributed to his development of pneumonia and vein swelling. Therefore, his injuries would be deemed to have arisen out of his employment and are not excluded by the act of God provision in the Compensation Act. The court will reverse the judgment of the lower court that sustained the general demurrer to his petition and remand the action for further proceedings consistent with this interpretation of the law, asserting Jackson's right to recover under the act. The court's reasoning will reference legal precedents that support the compensability of injuries caused by weather conditions while performing duties that create exposure to elements beyond what the general public faces. It will emphasize that injuries need not be accidental under the Texas Act, and that the employment, with its unique exposure and demands, effectively brings Jackson within the protective ambit of the Workmen’s Compensation Act."
"The plaintiffs, Corine Slocomb and Hazel Jean Billups, both licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) with extensive experience in patient care, were hired by the defendants to provide in-home care for Ms. Hanslip, an elderly woman with Parkinson's disease. This disease is characterized by unpredictable shaking and muscle weakness. Both plaintiffs were well aware of Ms. Hanslip's condition and were trained in transferring patients like her from a bed to a wheelchair, a task considered routine for LVNs. They had also taken additional training courses, including senior citizen care, and have cared for Parkinson's patients and ""difficult"" patients in the past.

The plaintiffs did not carry workers' compensation insurance. Their duties included various care activities, such as assisting Ms. Hanslip with walking and transfers between her bed and wheelchair. Plaintiffs had performed these duties without issue for some time before the incident.

On the incident day, while transferring Ms. Hanslip from her bed to her wheelchair, she resisted their efforts and did not follow instructions, which led her to suddenly stiffen and fall to the floor, resulting in injuries to both plaintiffs. Billups suffered a central disk herniation and bulging disk; Slocomb injured her knee, both requiring surgery.

The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligence, asserting a nondelegable duty to provide proper equipment, sufficient staffing, and a safe workplace. Defendants filed for summary judgment, citing the plaintiffs' inability to prove negligence due to the routine nature of the task during which the injuries occurred, the lack of previous complaints or requests for additional equipment or staffing, and the lack of foreseeability of the injuries.

The defendants' summary judgment included excerpts from plaintiffs' deposition testimony. Plaintiffs argued that they did provide evidence of foreseeable injury and that material facts were still in question. However, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment without specifying the grounds for its decision. Plaintiffs appealed, claiming the trial court erred in granting summary judgment, misapplied standards, and overlooked genuine issues of material fact.","In determining the verdict, the appellate court will consider if the defendants were negligent by analyzing three elements: duty, breach of duty, and damages caused by the breach. The plaintiffs will need to prove negligence since defendants do not carry workers' compensation insurance.

Given that Ms. Hanslip has Parkinson's disease and plaintiffs were both experienced and trained, including how to prevent falls, the lifting and transferring of Ms. Hanslip did not pose an increased threat of injury and was within their usual scope of work. Furthermore, plaintiffs knew about Ms. Hanslip's condition, which includes unpredictable shaking and muscle control loss, and had transferred her without incident several times prior to the day in question.

In relation to the claim that the defendants did not provide proper equipment, it will be noted that the plaintiffs, being trained professionals, never requested any such equipment to aid in their duties, indicating that they thought the provided setup was adequate for their work.

As for the claim of insufficient staffing, once when Billups faced difficulty with a transfer and requested help, the defendants responded by hiring two nurses, but no subsequent requests for additional staff were made, which will be interpreted as satisfaction with the staff levels.

Even with plaintiffs' age and in comparison to similar cases, the task they were performing was not unusual or hazardous by nature if performed by trained LVNs according to standard procedures.

Therefore, given the consistent precedent that employers are not liable for negligence when employees are performing routine tasks that do not pose an unusual or increased risk of injury, and considering the plaintiffs were carrying out their usual work at the time of the incident, the appellate court will most likely affirm the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The predictability of the occurrence due to Ms. Hanslip’s known condition and the lack of previous similar events will be seen as insufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants."
"Cynthia Garcia was employed as a prison guard at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) beginning in 2004 and was assigned to the Darrington Unit. On July 6, 2005, Garcia fell from a guard tower while on duty, sustaining serious injuries that resulted in multiple surgeries and lasting physical impairments. The guard tower, lacking air conditioning and meant for surveillance, featured a hatch cover that when opened, revealed a two-foot square opening leading to a 16-foot drop to the ground. According to procedures, the trapdoor should remain locked open only until the other guard had descended the ladder and safely reached the ground, after which it should be closed and remain so throughout the duty. However, after signaling another guard to send up ice, Garcia re-entered the tower forgetting the trapdoor was open and fell through the uncovered opening.

In light of her injuries, Garcia applied to the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS) for occupational-disability retirement benefits that are available for state employees who are ""permanently incapacitated from the further performance of duty"" and whose disability meets the statutory definition of an ""occupational disability."" The definition requires the disability to result solely from an extremely dangerous risk of severe physical or mental trauma not common to the public and peculiar to and inherent in a dangerous duty that arises from the nature and in the course of a person's state employment. ERS staff denied her application, and Garcia's appeal to ERS's Board of Trustees was referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) for a contested-case hearing.

At the hearing, it centralized on the dispute whether Garcia's fall and subsequent disability resulted solely from the extremely dangerous condition of her working environment or whether her own negligence contributed to her injury. The ALJ issued a proposal for decision (PFD) supporting Garcia's claim. However, the ERS's Executive Director on behalf of the Board, rejected the ALJ's PFD, adopting alternative findings and conclusions and ultimately denying Garcia's claim on the grounds that her injury was caused by her own negligence which did not result solely from an extremely dangerous condition of the work environment.","The case will likely be decided in favor of the ERS, with the judgment affirming ERS's final order denying Garcia's claim for occupational-disability retirement benefits. The ERS Executive Director's decision will be deemed within lawful discretion and consistent with the statutory definition of ""occupational disability."" Despite the serious injuries Garcia obtained from the fall—which are undisputed and acknowledged—her negligence in forgetting to close the trapdoor will be seen as an independent and contributing factor that prevents her disability from solely resulting from an extremely dangerous risk of her employment, which is a requisite to qualify for the benefits under the statutory definition.

The court will likely affirm that the Executive Director acted within the statutory authority by modifying the ALJ's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, provided plausible, detailed reasons for those modifications. Even though the injury occurred in the workplace and involved a feature of Garcia's working environment—the open trapdoor—her own conduct in not taking the basic safety measures of closing the trapdoor and keeping a proper lookout upon re-entering the tower will be interpreted as not being an inherent component of the extreme dangers of her duties. The ERS's interpretation of ""solely"" in the statute will be considered a reasonable construction, and courts are supposed to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation when the statute's language is within the agency's area of expertise, especially when it's ambiguous or leaves room for policy determination. The court will find that Garcia's failure to close the hatch and ensure that the chain was in place signified a break from the continuous risk inherent to the job and introduced an independent act of negligence on her part. Thus, while Garcia bore the risk of falling while performing her duties, her fall was ultimately not viewed as resulting ""solely"" from an extremely dangerous risk related to her work environment due to the presence of her own negligent actions. Consequently, the court will reverse the district court's judgment and render judgment in favor of ERS, upholding the agency's decision to deny occupational-disability retirement benefits."
"The Harris County Sports & Convention Corporation owns NRG Park, which includes NRG Stadium, NRG Center, and NRG Arena. SMG, a management company, was hired to oversee the operations of NRG Park. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (the Rodeo) operates the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at NRG Park for three weeks each March under a lease agreement with Harris County.

As part of their operations, SMG was required to install rubber mats on the concrete floors of the NRG Center. When not in use, these mats were rolled up and stored. During the event's preparations, the Rodeo would direct SMG on where to place the mats, and SMG would unroll them and tape the ends to one another with industrial duct tape. The bottom of the mats was not adhered to the concrete. The Rodeo was contractually responsible for maintaining the mats once the event started, but SMG personnel would also assist. Both sets of personnel replaced any duct tape that had lost adhesion during the event.

Jimaree Parrish, a Rodeo patron, attended the event on March 15, 2014, and tripped and fell on a curled-up corner of a rubber floor mat, sustaining serious injuries. She alleged that the curled-up mat was hidden by sawdust and wood shavings. Parrish sued the Rodeo and later added SMG as a defendant, presenting claims for negligence and premises liability. She accused the Rodeo and SMG of failing to keep the floor panels level and covered with sawdust that obscured defects, inadequately maintaining and securing floor panels, and failing to warn about the uneven floor.

SMG moved for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, asserting that it owed no duty to Parrish because the Rodeo was in control of the premises at the time of the injuries, and that there was no evidence of a negligent activity contemporaneous with Parrish’s injury. SMG argued that Parrish could not establish that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition. Both Michael DeMarco and Richard Fredette testified that they were unaware of previous instances where patrons tripped over the floor mats or mats curled due to duct tape coming undone.

Parrish responded, arguing that SMG should have used more durable installation methods in line with the manufacturer's recommendations that would have prevented the risk of the mats curling. She pointed out that SMG had provided duct tape to the Rodeo and that SMG and Rodeo personnel constantly replaced the tape, implying awareness of its potential to fail. Parrish also submitted affidavits from witnesses present at the time of the incident and from an engineer to support her claims that SMG knew of the danger and that a safer installation method should have been used. However, she presented no evidence demonstrating that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of the specific dangerous condition that caused her injury—i.e., the exact mat that she tripped over—or that it had existed for a sufficient length of time for SMG to have discovered and addressed it.","Summary judgment in favor of SMG was affirmed based on the determination that Parrish failed to present evidence that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition—that is, the specific curled-up floor mat that caused her injuries. SMG was aware that industrial duct tape might lose adhesion over time, leading to potential mat curls, but knowledge of a possible issue does not constitute actual knowledge of a specific existing danger. Thus, Parrish's claim that SMG was negligent in its failure to use a more secure method than duct tape to fix the mats to the floor did not establish that at the time of her injury, SMG was actually aware that the particular mat she tripped on posed a risk.

Further, no evidence was presented to indicate that the condition existed long enough for SMG to have reasonably discovered it through an inspection. The lack of temporal evidence and specific knowledge about the condition that caused Parrish's injury negates SMG's ability to foresee and prevent the risk. This absence of concrete details relating to the duration and visibility of the curled-up mat fails to meet the requirement of constructive knowledge, a necessary element to hold SMG liable under premises liability law.

Additionally, Parrish argued that SMG had a duty resulting from alleged negligent work performed on the property because it supplied duct tape for use and assisted with its replacement during the rodeo event. Still, there was no evidence indicating that SMG performed any such work in direct relation to the mat in question prior to the incident.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, Parrish did not raise a fact issue against SMG for the knowledge of the dangerous condition. The duties she alleged were unmet by SMG could not be substantiated due to lack of demonstrable knowledge of the specific hazard that led to her fall. As a result, the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for SMG on the premises liability claims was deemed proper."
"Appellant Maria S. Urena, suing on behalf of her minor child L.U., pursued legal action against the appellee, an apartment building known as Front Royale Apartments (identified alongside its owners and manager), due to personal injuries incurred from a sexual assault of L.U. on the premises. The apartment building had a history of violent crimes, including an attempted sexual assault, multiple robberies, and homicides between March 1997 and October 1999. The assault against L.U. occurred on November 6, 1999, when L.U. was lured into another tenant's apartment by Miguel Angel Zuniga and was subsequently assaulted. Although Zuniga had traffic offense convictions, he had no prior record for violent or sexual crimes and fled the scene before police arrived, remaining unfound.

The appellant alleged that the appellees were negligent and liable on the grounds of premises liability, among other claims. The appellees previously terminated their building security services without a replacement. The appellant contended the appellees were aware of various violent crimes within their premises yet failed to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of their tenants. The trial court initially granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of the building, dismissing all of the appellant’s claims, which led to the appellant's appeal, contending that there was sufficient evidence of negligence and duty breach regarding premises liability.","The judgment of the 269th District Court was expected to be reversed and remanded regarding the appellant’s premises liability claim on the basis that there was sufficient demonstrable evidence to establish material fact issues. In considering whether the sexual assault was foreseeable, the court needed to evaluate proximity, recency, frequency, similarity, and publicity of prior violent acts at or near the premises. Since the apartment complex had a history of violent crimes and management was aware of them, there appeared to be a foreseeable risk of harm, and therefore, a legal duty could potentially exist for the appellees to protect the tenants from third-party criminal acts.

Proximate cause might be established as the assault could be perceived as a foreseeable consequence of the appellees’ failure to provide adequate security. The appellant's allegations suggested that the appellees not only knew about prior incidents but also failed to use ordinary care in addressing the risks, as they lacked proper documentation for tenants and disregarded predetermined security measures by not maintaining security services. Such issues were predicted to raise doubts as to whether the appellees exercised ordinary care to prevent the crime.

Ultimately, the court was expected to conclude that material facts concerning foreseeable risk, duty, and breach thereof were to be decided by a trial, not at the summary judgment phase, due to the complexity and gravity of the claims involved. Therefore, it would be determined that the trial court's summary judgment in relation to appellant's premises liability claim was to be vacated, thus warranting a remand for further proceedings, while the remainder of the judgment pertaining to other claims (breach of contract, implied warranty of habitability, and violations of the DTPA) not being appealed remained affirmed."
"The plaintiff, R. S. Bearden Jr., owned a hog feeding business in Terry County, Texas. Bearden's operation included a climatized ""bacon bin"" reliant on electricity for heating, air conditioning, ventilation, and water supply. On August 25, 1968, Bearden and his wife departed their home around 11:30 a.m. to visit Bearden's brother. Their home lost electrical power at approximately 3:00 p.m., and by the time they returned at about 10:30 p.m., 142 hogs had suffocated due to lack of ventilation, and those that survived suffered considerable weight loss. Bearden reported the outage to Lyntegar Electric Cooperative, Inc., the defendant, who restored power promptly after being notified.

Bearden filed a negligence suit in Terry County, while Lyntegar filed a plea of privilege to be sued in Lynn County, where it was domiciled and resident. Bearden countered, claiming the negligence action should stay in Terry County as that is where the negligence resulting in damages occurred. The trial court sustained Lyntegar's plea, leading to Bearden's appeal.

To maintain venue in Terry County, Bearden had to prove by a preponderance of evidence that an act or omission of negligence occurred within the county. Bearden's main argument revolved around the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, contending that the electrical equipment was exclusively controlled by Lyntegar, and such a power outage does not typically occur without negligence.

No evidence was provided on how Lyntegar inspected or maintained its equipment, which precluded establishing negligence on these grounds. However, Bearden established that no electrical storms or equipment malfunctions under his control caused the outage, indicating that the fault was under Lyntegar's exclusive management and control.

The trial court did not receive any witnesses or evidence from Lyntegar to rebut the presumption of negligence, as Bearden's argument relied on the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. This doctrine implies that (1) accidents like this usually do not happen without negligence, and (2) the cause of the accident was managed and controlled by the defendant.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision based on the established principle that a consumer can infer negligence on a public utility's part through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when the utility has exclusive control over the relevant infrastructure and the type of accident that occurred ordinarily signifies negligence. The court will view Bearden's evidence as meeting the criteria for a res ipsa loquitur negligence claim by proving that no other plausible explanations, like natural occurrences or the plaintiff's equipment, caused the outage, and that the defect had to have originated in a segment managed solely by the defendant.

Moreover, given that Lyntegar furnished no evidence to counteract the presumption of negligence, they did not satisfy their shifted burden of production once a prima facie case was made against them. Hence, in the absence of any testimony or demonstration to the contrary, the established public policy and legal precedent dictate that the negligence inferred ought to lead to a decision favorable to Bearden. Therefore, the appellate court will find that Bearden sufficiently established a prima facie case by virtue of res ipsa loquitur, negating the trial court's rationale for sustaining Lyntegar's plea of privilege. The case will be remanded for a trial on the merits in Terry County with Lyntegar carrying the burden to rebut or overcome the established presumption of negligence."
"C. E. Boyer, the plaintiff insured, parked his automobile on a downtown street in the City of Waco on May 11, 1953. Shortly thereafter, a tornado struck the town, bringing lightning, rain, hail, and strong winds. One or more of these elements caused part of a nearby masonry building to be demolished, and debris from the building—including bricks and timber—fell upon and completely destroyed Boyer's automobile. Boyer held an automobile insurance policy on his car, which included a ""Collision or Upset"" clause with a $50.00 deductible. However, he did not carry insurance coverage for windstorms. After Boyer filed a claim for the value of his destroyed automobile ($1,100.00), the defendant insurance company denied the claim. The basis for the denial was that the destruction of the automobile was not the result of a collision but was due to a windstorm. The trial court agreed with Boyer that the damage resulted from a collision and rendered judgment in his favor. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld the trial court's decision, referencing previous cases and stating that the impact between the falling debris and the car constituted a collision within the terms of the insurance policy. The insurance company challenged this interpretation, citing other cases, arguing that the dominant cause of destruction was the windstorm, not a collision. The case was brought before the Supreme Court for final adjudication.","The Supreme Court will reverse the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals and the trial court's judgment, concluding that Boyer is not entitled to recovery under the collision clause of his insurance policy. The Court will firmly establish that the true cause of the damage was not a collision but rather the windstorm, which is a distinctly defined peril in insurance policies and not covered under Boyer's collision clause. The Court will clarify that a collision, in common understanding, would require a more direct and forceful contact between two objects in motion, which was not the case here, as the bricks and timbers only impacted the car due to being carried by the wind.

The Court will emphasize the purpose and practices of the State Insurance Commission in defining and segregating insurance risks to allow the public to choose intentional coverage options. By parsing the various coverages provided by an insurance policy, the Court will state that Boyer made a conscious decision to purchase collision coverage without opting for windstorm coverage—which would have included protection against the kind of event that destroyed his vehicle. The Court will cite Glen Falls Ins. Co. v. McCown for the principle that insurance policy terms should be understood in their everyday meaning and consider the consumer's choices in determining policy intent.

The Court will reinforce that the ultimate determination of whether a loss falls within a given coverage provision of an insurance policy is guided by the clear definitions and intent behind these definitions as established by the Insurance Commission. Therefore, the ruling will be centered on the premise that the loss falls under the policy's windstorm provision, which Boyer did not select, and not under the collision provision. The Supreme Court's decision will lead to a judgment that Boyer take nothing, and costs will be taxed against him."
"Appellants John Edward Hennessy and Donald Lee Wine, who were pedestrians, filed a personal injury action against the estate of Rudy Perez following a sequence of events that led to their injuries. On January 6, 1985, at 3:00 a.m., Rudy Perez lost control of his truck on I-10 in Houston. The truck collided with a guardrail, flipped, and ended up blocking the leftmost traffic lane. Perez was projected out of the truck onto the highway, where he sustained severe injuries leading to his death. Police later found both opened and unopened beer cans in the truck's cab. Hennessy and Wine stopped to assist Perez. While Wine set up flares on the road with the help of an off-duty policeman and Hennessy phoned for medical help, Robert Lesley Clay, driving a car owned by Jimmy Charles Clay, drove through the flares and hit the appellants at approximately 3:20 a.m. Clay was arrested at the scene for driving while intoxicated.

Appellants originally filed suit against the Clays and Perez, alleging their negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries. They settled with the Clays and subsequently, the trial court granted a take-nothing summary judgment in favor of Perez's estate, asserting that Perez's actions could not have caused the appellant's injuries as they had already ceased, and the occurrence was unforeseeable, thus acting as a superseding cause.","The court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee driver's estate. Firstly, the fact question pertaining to the appellants' entitlement to the benefit of the rescue doctrine will be found relevant. The appellants engaged in a rescue effort by setting up flares and calling for an ambulance, planning to stay until help arrived. The rescue doctrine recognizes the liability of a negligent party when they provoke a rescue effort, and the rescuer's injury is a consequence that could reasonably have been foreseen by the negligent defendant. Since the appellants were injured while attempting rescue, it would be considered foreseeable under this doctrine that such rescue actions could result in injury, particularly on a heavily trafficked highway.

Even without resorting to the rescue doctrine, it will be contended that a fact issue remains, preventing summary judgment, linked to whether Perez's conduct while allegedly driving intoxicated on a busy interstate could have foreseen the threat to the appellants. The required foreseeability factor in negligence is not dependent on the prediction of the exact incident but rather on whether the type of injury was of such a general character that might reasonably have been anticipated.

Finally, the ""Bell v. Campbell"" case will not be deemed analogous or controlling in this situation, given that the case at hand involves an unsettled question concerning the foreseeability of the appellants' injuries, and the rescue doctrine was not an issue in the Bell case. The court's decision will focus on the fact that there is still an open factual dispute regarding the foreseeability of the injury, which means the summary judgment was improperly granted. 

The case will be remanded for a trial on the merits based on the complex interplay of issues around foreseeability and the application of the rescue doctrine, indicating that the matter is not suitable for summary judgment and requires a full trial to resolve these factual disputes."
"The case involves an appeal by appellants, the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railway Company and Walker D. Hines as the Director General of Railroads acting as an agent for the federal government, challenging the judgment given by the District Court of Potter County, Texas. The District Court found in favor of the appellee, an employee of the railway company, in his action for the personal injuries of his wife and the death of his infant son. The appellants argued that the evidence was insufficient, that evidence was improperly admitted, and that the charges on contributory negligence were erroneous.

The employee, working as a pumper for the railway company, lived with his family in box cars furnished by the company located near the train tracks. There were concerns for the safety of the children because of the proximity to the passing trains, necessitating constant vigilance by the parents. The accident occurred on July 9, 1919, when one of the children was seen on the tracks by his mother as a fast train was approaching. The mother, attempting to rescue the child, was injured, and the child was killed by the train.

At trial, the employee claimed the company was negligent in running the train at a high rate of speed near their living quarters, failing to maintain a proper lookout for persons on the track, and not taking proper care to prevent injury after discovering there was a danger. The company presented a defense of contributory negligence, suggesting the parents were negligent in allowing the child on the track and that the mother acted rashly in her rescue attempt. The jury sided with the plaintiff, finding the defendants negligent in the first two allegations and not in the third, while rejecting the defense of contributory negligence.

The plaintiff originally brought the suit against the railway company, but after the termination of federal control of the railways, added Hines as a party. The District Court ruled against both defendants jointly and severally, an outcome which the appellants sought to reverse, asserting liability should rest with the Director General alone, not the company.","Considering the facts presented in the background, the appeal will focus on several key issues. The reversal in regards to the company's liability is based on the principle that the company should not be held liable in its corporate capacity, given that federal control was in effect at the time of the accident. The court will likely rule that the responsibility lies with the government representative, the Director General, who was in control of the railway operations during the federal oversight, therefore dismissing the railway company from the case.

The court's decision on the issue of whether there was a duty to lessen the speed of trains in anticipation of a trespasser will center on the particular circumstances of the location and the fact that there was no crossing, switch tracks, or other operational needs requiring a slowing of the train. The lack of these conditions, combined with the uncontested right of the railway to the exclusive use of its tracks, will lead the court to agree with the appellants that there was no duty necessitating a reduced speed based solely on the proximity of the family's living quarters.

However, the court will likely uphold the duty of the railway to exercise ordinary care in maintaining a lookout for individuals on the track, regardless of their trespassing status. The decision will turn on the evidence showing the feasibility of detecting a child on the tracks from a significant distance, potentially allowing for injury avoidance. Given the evidence, such as the father's ability to see the child from a distance and the tests conducted by various witnesses, the court will find that the jury was justified in determining that the engineer, had he been keeping a proper lookout, would have observed the boy in time to avert the accident.

With respect to contributory negligence, the court will hold that the question of the parents' vigilance was properly submitted to the jury. The parents' failure to prevent the child from entering the tracks does not conclusively establish a lack of ordinary care on their part. Additionally, the court will sustain the legality of the mother's rescue attempt as not being rash, but a split-second decision under emergent conditions.

The court will also address evidentiary issues, such as the admission of tests simulating the visibility of a child on the tracks and statements regarding past conversations between the plaintiff and a representative of the company. While some evidence regarding agreements on safety improvements might have been prejudicial, the objection was not specific enough to form the basis for overturning the verdict.

Based on these considerations, the verdict will affirm the findings of liability against the Director General of Railroads, while reversing the judgment as to the railway company. The Director General, rather than the company, will be held accountable for the negligence identified by the jury—specifically, the failure to maintain a proper lookout. The railway company will be dismissed from the case due to federal control at the time of the accident, placing liability squarely with the government agent."
"On September 19, 1993, a 14-year-old named Steven Barker shot and killed Jackie Condren using .45 caliber bullets that had been purchased from AAA Pawn Shop, which was owned and operated by R.L. Bowman. Jackie Condren's wife, Johnell Condren, along with other family members, filed a lawsuit against R.L. Bowman, alleging negligence in the sale of the ammunition to a minor. The case saw various procedural developments. The claims by the Condren children were dismissed, leaving Johnell as the sole plaintiff, represented by Willie Holder as her next friend due to her mental incompetency. The trial court initially granted a summary judgment in favor of R.L. Bowman, leading to an appeal which was dismissed and remanded due to jurisdictional issues. Following this, an amended motion for summary judgment was filed by Bowman and subsequently granted on December 27, 1999, which led to the current appeal.

Holder argued four issues for consideration: 1) the application of res judicata, 2) Holder's standing to bring suit as Johnell's next friend, 3) whether the sale of .45 caliber ammunition to a child could constitute negligence or negligence per se, and 4) regarding the claims of negligence and the rule on no evidence motions in summary judgments. The appeal focused on whether the sale of the ammunition to a minor was a duty breached and whether that breach was a proximate cause of Jackie Condren's death. Holder cited federal law 18 U.S.C.A. § 922(b)(1), indicating it was illegal for a licensed dealer to sell or deliver certain types of ammunition to individuals under specified ages, arguing that this breach of law constituted negligence per se. However, even considering that, Holder needed to demonstrate the connection between the sale and the death as a proximate cause, with foreseeability as a key component.","When discussing the third and fourth points raised, which are pivotal in this case, the court will focus on the elements of a negligence cause of action which include duty, breach of duty, and damages proximately caused by the breach. While Holder points out that the federal statute creates a duty for sellers to not sell ammunition to minors, which was allegedly breached in this case, it will be determined that Holder failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that this breach was the proximate cause of Johnell's husband's death.

The court will emphasize that even if a breach of duty is found due to a violation of statute, it must also be shown that such a breach was a proximate cause of the injury sustained. This includes showing that the harm was foreseeable as a result of the negligence. Despite Holder's assertion that Johnell Condren falls within the class of individuals the statute aims to protect, and that the death was an outcome of a minor's actions that stemmed from the illegal sale of ammunition, there will be a requirement for specific evidence showing that the harm was foreseeable at the time of the sale. The criminal act of Barker, being a separate intervening action, will be deemed a superseding cause unless it was a foreseeable result of the negligence posed by Bowman's sale of ammunition to the minor.

The court will then address foreseeability and cause in fact as components of proximate cause, with a focus on whether there was any evidence indicating that Barker appeared incompetent, reckless, or dangerous when purchasing the ammunition, making his criminal conduct foreseeable to Bowman. Binder's argument that foreseeability is inherent in any sale of ammunition to minors will not be accepted, as that argument would effectively make a seller liable for any injuries resulting from such sales, transforming the seller into an insurer, which is not supported by Texas case law.

In conclusion, the court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Bowman, stating that Holder failed to present sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding proximate cause. The court will find that there were no facts shown from which Bowman should have been able to foresee Barker's subsequent criminal action, and thus, the actions that resulted in the death of Johnell's husband were not a foreseeable consequence of the sale of ammunition to the minor."
"The appellant, an employee, sued the appellee, his employer, for damages resulting from the loss of his left eye, which he alleged was caused by the employer's negligence. The employee claimed that while he was working as a head brakeman on one of the employer's freight trains, a piece of hot sand or other foreign matter was blown from the firebox of the locomotive's engine and struck him in the eye, resulting in the loss of sight in that eye. It was necessary to throw sand into the firebox to clean accumulated soot from the flues, and he suspected that the injury occurred due to the sand being improperly blown out of the sand-hole, a four-inch opening at the end of the firebox that should have been secured by a spring. The employee put forth several specific negligence claims, including that the door to the sand-hole didn't fit securely, the spring was not strong enough, the door was left open by the engineer or fireman without his knowledge, and the atomizer had not been properly adjusted, leading to a backfire which could have blown hot sand or substances out of the firebox. In addition, the employee invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, suggesting that the accident itself implied negligence by the employer.

The appellee denied these accusations and additionally argued that the appellant assumed the risks connected with his employment and that the case was governed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The trial was to a jury, and based on the appellant's evidence alone, the appellee moved for a peremptory instruction, which was granted. As a result, the jury returned a verdict for the appellee, upon which judgment was accordingly entered.","It is likely that the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, rejecting the employee's claim for damages. The reasoning could include that to establish negligence, there needs to be a reasonable and probable connection between the injury and the negligence alleged against the employer, and such a connection must not be left to conjecture. The appellant's claim is based on his testimony and supposition rather than concrete evidence connecting the employer’s alleged negligence directly to his injury. The court may determine that the employee's belief that the injury was caused by sand from the firebox is not sufficiently backed by evidence that excludes other possible causes. Given multiple potential causes of the injury, the employee's failure to demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, that the injury was the direct result of the employer's negligence will be a crucial factor in upholding the dismissal. An affirming court would likely conclude that, as the injury could have resulted from different causes not attributable to the employer’s liability, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply. Further, any errors in the trial concerning the exclusion of testimony about prior reports of the sand-hole door's condition would be considered harmless, as they do not contribute substantially to proving the cause of the appellant’s injury. Therefore, the court's future stance would maintain that the jury did not err in its verdict for the appellee, considering that more than mere suspicion or surmise is required to deprive a defendant of its standing."
"William Nami, a railroad employee of Union Pacific Railroad (Union Pacific) for 32 years, contracted the West Nile virus from a mosquito bite and sued his employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (""FELA""), alleging that Union Pacific failed to provide a safe workplace. Nami operated a tamping machine in Brazoria County near Sweeny, known for its dense mosquito population, which increased following Hurricane Ike. The area surrounding the tracks where Nami worked was overgrown with weeds, high grass, and sometimes pools of water. Nami was frequently bitten by mosquitoes on the job, even inside the tamper, which had holes and a non-functioning air conditioner. Union Pacific knew about the risk that mosquitoes could carry the West Nile virus and had issued bulletins warning employees about the virus and recommending the use of mosquito repellent, though they did not provide repellent to employees.

Nami became ill with flu-like symptoms, which escalated and were later diagnosed as West Nile virus and encephalitis. His illness resulted in long-term health problems, preventing him from returning to work. Nami did not have prior knowledge of the bulletin or warnings from Union Pacific, was unaware of the risks of the West Nile virus, and did not take measures to prevent mosquito bites. At trial, a jury found both Union Pacific and Nami negligent, attributing 80% of the responsibility to Union Pacific and 20% to Nami, and awarded Nami $752,000 in damages.

Union Pacific appealed, invoking the common-law doctrine of ferae naturae, arguing that they owed no legal duty to protect against wild animals (mosquitoes in this case) indigenous to the property unless the landowner had attracted or controlled the animals, which they had not.","The verdict for the case will likely be that the doctrine of ferae naturae applies, which precludes railroad liability because Union Pacific did not attract or control the mosquitoes. The duty to provide a safe workplace does not extend to uncontrollable, indigenous wild animals unless the property owner has taken action to concentrate such animals on the property, has reduced them to possession, or knows of an unreasonable risk that can be mitigated or warned against. Since mosquitoes are indigenous to Texas, and there is no evidence that Union Pacific could have possibly attracted or controlled the mosquito population around its tracks or reduced the mosquitoes to possession, they had no duty to protect Nami from them.

In assessing foreseeability, while Union Pacific did issue a bulletin warning employees about the West Nile virus, which indicates some level of foreseeability, the risk of contracting it was relatively low, and less than 1% of cases develop serious illnesses. The mere presence of local mosquitoes, even in large numbers, does not itself indicate an unreasonable risk created by the employer, nor does it demonstrate that the employer's actions or inactions significantly exacerbated an existing natural risk. Moreover, Union Pacific's failure to mow the right-of-way or repair the tamper cab could not be definitively linked to creating an environment that attracted infected mosquitoes.

In light of these factors, the judgment of the lower court will likely be reversed, and a judgment rendered for Union Pacific, on the grounds that there was no breach of duty under FELA by Union Pacific when Nami contracted the West Nile virus. The application of the ferae naturae doctrine will be upheld, indicating that Union Pacific is not liable for Nami’s injuries contracted from indigenous wild animals that they did not attract or control on the property."
"The petitioners, husband and wife Daryl and Faith May, sought health insurance coverage when health insurance was not provided by Daryl's employer. They decided on a health insurance policy shortly after their marriage in December 1982. Daryl's mother, Alice May, helped them inquire about health policies at Preston Insurance Agency, Inc. (""Preston""), where Daryl previously purchased auto insurance. Alice spoke with agent Rex Wiley who gave her a brochure for the ""Double Eagle"" group policy underwritten by Continental Bankers of the South (""Continental"") available to members of the United Services Association of America (""United"").

The Double Eagle policy had relatively low premiums and deductibles but included a termination provision allowing the underwriter to cancel the group coverage at any time and a deferral provision that deferred coverage for members who were hospitalized or totally disabled when coverage began.

In March 1983, Faith met with Wiley and discussed the policy. Despite not being informed of Continental's mediocre ""C"" rating from A.M. Best or alternative policies like an individual health policy from Reserve Life, the Mays unlocked maternity and dependent health coverage, joined United for a fee, and purchased the Double Eagle policy, which commenced on April 1, 1983.

In mid-1984, Continental terminated the United group policy, whereupon Hermitage Insurance Company (""Hermitage"") took over with the same benefits. When Faith became pregnant, Wiley reassured her that Hermitage would maintain their coverage. However, by July 1985, Hermitage terminated the United group and Keystone Life Insurance Company (""Keystone"") assumed control. Keystone classified the Mays' newborn son, Jared May, who was born with serious health conditions, as totally disabled, invoking the deferral provision and refusing to cover his medical expenses beyond a 90-day period after Hermitage’s termination. Jared was left uninsured until his death in November 1987.

The Mays filed suit alleging negligence and misrepresentation against Preston, United, Keystone, and Hermitage, but the latter two companies were severed from the case. The jury found that Preston and United's negligence proximately caused the Mays' injuries in failing to procure stable insurance coverage as requested, assessing causation at 40% and 60%, respectively. The jury awarded damages for unpaid medical expenses but not for mental anguish, and did not find gross negligence.

Preston appealed the jury's verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment of negligence liability, and upon further appeal, the Supreme Court was tasked with determining whether Wiley's actions constituted negligence and proximately caused the Mays' loss. The Supreme Court examined whether there was evidence of three alleged failures: negligence in selecting the Double Eagle policy, negligence in failing to investigate the financial solvency of Hermitage and/or Keystone, and negligence in placing coverage with potentially insolvent companies.","The Supreme Court reasoned that to reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, there must be evidence that any of Preston's alleged failures constituted negligence and proximately caused the Mays' loss. The first theory considered negligence in procuring the Double Eagle policy; however, the Mays were aware of the termination provision. Wiley recommended the policy to the Mays, but there was no specific negligent action identified, nor was there evidence of why the potential shifting of underwriters posed an unjustified risk specifically to the Mays. No evidence indicated Wiley should have prevented them from assuming such a risk or anticipated their unique circumstances, hence no blanket negligence claim could be established.

Regarding Wiley's failure to investigate the financial solvency of Hermitage and Keystone or to adequately investigate before placing coverage, it was noted that Hermitage and Keystone were not the underwriters when coverage was initially placed in 1983 (Continental was), and financial instability of these companies did not contribute to the loss since all claims were honored. No testimony indicated Hermitage's business decisions, which led to the policy being transferred and Jared's coverage at risk under the deferral provision, were due to financial instability.

The court also considered the jurisprudence regarding an agent’s duty to procure insurance, acknowledging established cases where agents were found liable due to a client's reasonable but detrimental belief that they were covered against certain risks – conditions not present in this case. Moreover, the court referenced cases that involved liability when the customer was misled about the coverage obtained. Although a more thorough discussion, disclosure of policy alternatives, or comparison of benefits would have constituted better service, Wiley's recommendation of the Double Eagle policy alone did not amount to negligence under Texas law.

Ultimately, the court determined there was no evidence to support the Mays' negligence theories as to any of the alleged failures. Wiley's decision in policy recommendation, despite being less than optimal, did not constitute negligence that proximately caused the Mays' injuries. The judgment would affirm the Court of Appeals' decision to reverse the trial court’s judgment, upholding that the Mays did not present evidence to satisfy their claims in the complaint—concluding that respondent agent Wiley did not breach his duty of care in a manner that proximately resulted in the plaintiffs' losses."
"The heirs of a deceased patient, Delores McLean, brought a medical malpractice action against Dr. Robert Morrow Welch after Delores died from a massive pulmonary embolus. On April 24, 1996, Delores presented to the emergency room, complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain. Dr. Welch diagnosed Delores as suffering from sinusitis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypoxemia, but failed to diagnose pulmonary emboli. Over the next few months, Delores sought medical help several times, but not until July 8, 1996, did any indication of a problem other than pneumonia arise. She collapsed at home on July 9 and was pronounced dead shortly after midnight on July 10, 1996. Autopsy results revealed that the cause of Delores's death was a massive saddle embolus and showcased evidence of a left deep leg vein thrombosis. Microscopic examination of her lungs showed emboli that were present four to six weeks before her death, suggesting they were present during her visit to the ER on April 24, 1996. Based on this evidence and the omission of the full diagnosis, the jury found that Dr. Welch’s negligence had proximately caused Delores's death and awarded significant damages to the heirs.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment that awarded the heirs the entire damages amount and will render a judgment that awards damages based on the cap. The reasoning will be that the Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act’s noneconomic damages cap does apply to the jury's damages award, restricting the maximum amount the heirs can recover from Dr. Welch to the specified cap as adjusted by the consumer price index. This cap is in place regardless of the Stowers doctrine, which applies only to insurers, not to physicians or healthcare providers themselves. Therefore, the expert testimony by Simeon’s experts in conjunction with the autopsy findings will be deemed legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Delores was suffering from pulmonary emboli when Dr. Welch treated her on April 24, 1996. However, the trial court’s refusal to apply the damages cap to the jury's damages award and prejudgment interest was erroneous. The appellate court will conclude that former article 4590i, section 11.02(c) of the 1977 Texas General Laws, which does not lift the cap applicable to physicians, controls the outcome, as it only addresses the insurer's Stowers liability to the insured physician and does not affect the damages cap. The verdict will also maintain that prejudgment interest on noneconomic damages is subject to the damages cap and that a settlement credit is deducted from the total amount of damages to be recovered in the entire cause of action, not just the damages recoverable against a single codefendant. Thus, the trial court did not err in how it applied the settlement credit to the damages award. The heirs will be awarded specific amounts to Simeon individually and as heir to Delores McLean's estate, as well as next friend of Jamila Imari McLean and Imani Zakiya McLean, without any prejudgment interest, but with entitlement to postjudgment interest, court costs, and ad litem fees."
"Carol Peeler, the appellant, was an officer at Hillcrest Equities, Inc., a corporation that traded in securities. She and other Hillcrest principals were under federal criminal investigation by the IRS for various offenses. Peeler hired the appellees, attorney Darrell Jordan, and the Hughes & Luce law firm, where Jordan was a partner, and paid a substantial retainer fee. An assistant U.S. Attorney overseeing the investigation offered Peeler transactional immunity in exchange for cooperation, but Jordan did not communicate this offer to Peeler nor respond to the assistant U.S. Attorney. Peeler contends that Jordan's loyalty to other defendants was why the immunity offer was not relayed to her.

Later, a federal grand jury indicted Peeler and others for various offenses, and another suspect who accepted immunity provided information used to prosecute the rest, including Peeler. She pleaded guilty to aiding the preparation of a fraudulent U.S. partnership tax return and was sentenced to probation and a fine. Peeler claimed she entered the guilty plea on the advice of Hughes & Luce lawyers and discovered the immunity offer three days after her plea. Asserting that the failure to communicate the immunity offer caused her indictment and conviction, she sued for damages citing negligence, gross negligence, and a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), as well as breach of contract and breach of implied warranty.

The appellees moved for summary judgment on several grounds, arguing that Peeler would not have received immunity, the offer was unauthorized, for policy reasons her own conduct was the cause of her indictment and conviction, and that Peeler did not seek to withdraw her plea or set aside the conviction. The court ruled in favor of appellees based on policy reasons and the fact that Peeler had not sought postconviction relief prior to the hearing on summary judgment. Peeler's actions were seen as the proximate cause of her injuries, nullifying the alleged malpractice by the appellees. The court dismissed her claims against her defense team and she did not win the breach of contract claim in trial court.

After the judgment, Peeler filed a motion to vacate the judgment on her guilty plea in federal court. On appeal, her grievances included that her conduct was not the exclusive cause of her indictment and conviction; no policy barred her claim; and that innocence or remedy exhaustion were not prerequisites. She also argued that the judgment violated equal protection rights, Texas's open courts provision, and the ""outlawry"" provision of the Texas Constitution.","The court's future prediction is that it will uphold the summary judgment in favor of the appellees because Peeler cannot establish causation for her malpractice claims until she proves her innocence of the tax fraud charges. The rationale will be that Texas policy and decisions from various state courts emphasize that public policy does not support allowing a criminal defendant to profit from legal malpractice actions without proving their innocence first. This policy rationale is tied to the proposition that a criminal's own actions are the natural and primary cause of any legal consequences they face, including indictments and convictions. Therefore, without establishing her innocence, Peeler cannot convincingly argue that her attorney's failure to communicate an immunity offer was the proximate or producing cause of her damages, as per the usual criteria for legal malpractice cases.

Verdict reasoning would detail that neither negligence nor DTPA claims will stand because the appellant will be unable to demonstrate that her attorney's actions were the proximate (in negligence claims) or producing (in DTPA claims) cause of her damages. The court will reason that requiring proof of innocence or postconviction relief before allowing a malpractice claim against a criminal defense attorney aligns with long-standing legal principles and public policy aimed at preventing financial gain from one’s criminal activity.

The verdict will further clarify that the summary judgment does not violate Peeler's right to equal protection, as she, a criminal defendant, does not belong to a suspect class and the judgment is logically connected to the objectives of the legal system. The judgment also does not breach Texas constitution’s open courts provision since it does not stem from any statutory infringement on a common-law cause of action. Lastly, Peeler’s argument that she is being treated as an outlaw will be dismissed since the judgment does not prevent her from proving her innocence or seeking relief through other legal means; it simply follows policy that prohibits economic benefits from one’s crime for malpractice claims. Therefore, the court's expected determination would be an affirmation of the summary judgment in favor of the law firm and partner, upholding their motion on policy grounds associated with causation, while disregarding other potential grounds for summary judgment."
"Francisca Olivares, the plaintiff pedestrian, filed a personal injury action against the San Antonio Public Service Company, the defendant utility. The plaintiff alleged that while she was walking along a public street on the outskirts of the City of San Antonio, during or shortly following an unprecedented rain and electric storm, three overhead electric light wires owned by the defendant fell to the ground due to the defendant's negligence, causing her to suffer a severe shock and serious bodily injuries. The plaintiff articulated several acts of negligence on the part of the defendant, including assertions that the insulation on the wires was faulty, the wires were too loosely strung, the defendant had failed to inspect the wires within a reasonable time, the wires were strung too low, and the defendant had failed to bury the wires.

The case was brought to trial, and the jury was tasked with determining the truth of these allegations. Each of the alleged acts of negligence was submitted as special issues to the jury, who found against the plaintiff on each count. The jury concluded that the wires fell as a result of lightning, that the plaintiff suffered no physical shock or damage due to the fallen wires, and therefore had not sustained any damages. The plaintiff acknowledged, by not challenging the jury findings, that there was sufficient testimony to support these conclusions.

During the trial, the issue of whether the defendant was negligent for not having buried the wires was raised. An argument made by one of the defendant's counsel suggested that burying the wires would be very costly and would cause the utility to charge higher rates, which could have influenced the jury as some jurors were consumers of electricity provided by the defendant. The plaintiff objected to this argument, but the objection was overruled with the court stating that the argument was unlikely to have influenced the jury's specific findings regarding the lack of shock, damages, and the cause of the wires falling.

Furthermore, the plaintiff requested the trial judge to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which would infer negligence from the mere occurrence of the event, but the trial judge refused, given the jury's findings.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, denying the plaintiff, Francisca Olivares, any recovery. The verdict will be supported by the jury's specific findings, which effectively reject each of the plaintiff's allegations of negligence. Since the jury determined that the incident's occurrence, namely the falling of wires, was caused solely by lightning—a factor not under the control of the defendant utility—the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur will be declared inapplicable. Additionally, the jury's findings that the plaintiff did not suffer any physical shock or damages from the fallen wires mean that even if there was negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recovery without proven injury or damages.

The reasoning for the court's verdict will also address the objections raised by the plaintiff regarding the allegedly prejudicial comments made by the defendant's counsel. The court will determine that even if the counsel's arguments concerning the cost of burying the wires and the difficulty in procuring witnesses were improper, they were ultimately harmless given that they did not likely influence the jury's decision based on the context of the full jury findings.

Therefore, the court's ruling will center on the jury's determinations which did not find the utility's negligence nor damages to the plaintiff, rendering the plaintiff's objections and requests for reconsideration moot and leading to the affirmation of the judgment by the appellate court."
"The appellant, Carolyn Barker, as administratrix of the estate of Amy Robinson, brought forth a case against The Kroger Company and Kroger Texas Limited Partnership (collectively referred to as ""Kroger"") after a tragic incident resulted in the death of Amy Robinson. Amy was abducted and murdered by two former Kroger employees, James Robert Neville, Jr., and Michael Wayne Hall, as she was en route to her job at Kroger, riding her bike. Both perpetrators had ceased working at Kroger four months before the murder.

The criminals had a history of criminal and supremacist beliefs, as evident by their reason for buying guns and a bet they had amongst themselves to ""kill the most niggers."" On the day of the murder, Neville and Hall, attempting to find a specific black man at Kroger, discovered from the work schedule that Amy was due for work. Neville knew her routine and the route she took to work. When they encountered Amy, they offered her a ride, which she accepted, and afterwards, they committed the murder.

Amy was described as mentally challenged, whereas Neville had a record of a previous felony conviction for burglary, which he disclosed when hired at Kroger. Amy and Neville knew each other from work and had developed a friendship; Amy had even accompanied Neville to a Kroger Christmas party after he had left the company.

The appellant in her ordinary negligence claim suggested that Kroger was negligent by allowing Neville and Hall access to the work schedule and by employing felons alongside individuals like Amy with mental challenges. There was no evidence that Kroger was aware of any violent tendencies from Neville or Hall, nor had they experienced any similar incidents where someone used a work schedule to locate and kill an employee.","The court will hold that the previous criminal conduct of Neville and Hall, particularly their acts leading to Amy's murder, were superseding causes that absolve Kroger from liability in this case. The court's reasoning will rely on a set of established considerations that reveal the murder as unforeseeable by Kroger. Specifically, the court will find that the harm inflicted, Amy's murder, was of a different nature than what could be anticipated from any alleged negligence by Kroger. Moreover, the court will consider the act of murder to be extraordinary and not a normal consequence of the work environment or any alleged negligence, such as the posting of work schedules that could lead to such a crime.

Additionally, the friendship developed between Amy and Neville, with no evidence of fear or apprehension from Amy, underlines the unpredictability of the crime. There was no indication that Kroger could have foreseen Neville's and Hall's affiliation with supremacist beliefs or violent intentions. As the abduction occurred off the company's premises and during a period when Neville and Hall were no longer employees, the court will deem this as an independent intervening force, not created by Kroger’s alleged negligence.

Since Kroger successfully negated the element of foreseeability within the context of proximate cause, the burden shifted to the appellant to present countervailing evidence indicating such a crime could have been foreseen. The appellant failed to provide such evidence, resulting in the failure to meet the burden of proof.

In conclusion, based on the lack of foreseeable risk and absence of relevant evidence presented by the appellant that would suggest foreseeability, the court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Kroger, thereby dismissing the ordinary negligence claim. The company's lack of knowledge of any violent predispositions by the former employees and the extraordinary nature of the crime establish the murder as a superseding cause that Kroger could not have reasonably anticipated, hence absolving the company of ordinary negligence in this incident."
"The appellant in this case is a guaranty company which challenged the judgment made in favor of the appellees—a deceased employee's widow and minor children—regarding an award under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Law. The award was initially made by the Industrial Accident Board due to the death of W. C. Rochester, an employee of the Lone Star Gas Company, who was killed by lightning on July 30, 1924, while working on excavating a pipeline. The guaranty company was dissatisfied with the award and argued that Rochester was killed by an act of God and was not engaged in any duties that exposed him to a greater hazard than the general public, thus claiming it should not be liable under Texas law (Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5246 82).

The evidence provided was substantial, including eyewitness testimony stating that at the time of his death, Rochester was digging a ditch along a pipeline with other men. It was an open, flat country area with few trees and no buildings nearby. It wasn't obvious that a storm was approaching, and the accident happened without warning. Witnesses also described the electrical conditions that presumably attracted the lightning strike to Rochester, including the steel shovel he was using and the steel pipe line he was working over.

The trial court decided in favor of the appellees (the widow and her children), affirming the award by the Industrial Accident Board. The guaranty company then appealed the decision.","In reviewing the appeal, the court held that the witness called by the appellees as an expert in electricity was competent, despite the company's objections, and that the trial court correctly overruled the company's objection concerning his qualifications. The evidence was deemed sufficient to sustain the jury's finding that the deceased was indeed engaged in the performance of duties that subjected him to a greater hazard from the act of God responsible for the injury than ordinarily applied to the general public.

The appellant’s complaints about the sufficiency of the evidence and the court's interactions with the expert witness on electricity were considered unfounded. The court found that while the cases cited by the appellant might suggest otherwise, those cases often had a distinct finding that there wasn't an unusual risk incidental to the employment, which was not the case here.

The appellant also raised objections to certain questions the trial court posed to a witness and the language used by counsel for the appellee during arguments, but these concerns were not found to be of a character warranting a reversal of judgment. The court determined that any possible prejudice by such actions was mitigated by proper jury instruction to ignore those elements.

Predicting the court’s reasoning and based on available evidence, it is likely that the court will uphold the trial court’s judgment, affirm that the jury's finding had ample support in evidence and testimony, and further hold that the qualifications of the expert witness were satisfactory. The court will also likely dismiss the appellant's concerns about the trial court's conduct and counsel's language during the trial as not materially prejudicial to the outcome, especially considering the jury had been instructed to disregard them. Thus, the verdict will likely be that the court will affirm the trial court’s judgment and overrule the company's motion for rehearing."
"Appellee A.H. Daniel, an employee of appellant Rio Bravo Oil Company, brought a personal injury action against his employer after sustaining injuries from exposure to poisonous and deadly gases while cleaning a crude petroleum oil storage tank at the Spindletop oil field in Jefferson County, Texas. The tank, which had been used for storage, contained large quantities of these gases, and Daniel claimed that the company was aware or should have been aware of their presence. He alleged that he was not warned about the dangers and that the company had been negligent on several grounds. He was seeking damages of $35,000 for injuries, including harm to his lungs, kidneys, head, nervous system, heart, and body tissues. Daniel and other fellow employees were directed by the company's foreman to clean out the tank on October 30, 1927. Daniel entered the tank via a manhole and was soon overcome by the poisonous gases, which led to him being hospitalized with various debilitating conditions that he claimed resulted in permanent damage and impairment of his ability to work and earn money.

The trial court ruled in favor of Daniel, and a jury awarded him $7,500 with an interest rate of 6% per annum from the date of the judgment. The appellant raised multiple objections to the form of the issues submitted to the jury, the refusal of the court to submit a special issue requested by the appellant, errors in court instructions on legal terms, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict, which the appellant believed was excessive.","The court will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for a new trial. The appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding of the extent of damages will be upheld because the evidence of the appellee's ongoing physical condition as described by both himself and Dr. Bailey, along with the causes of these conditions, will be found to be in conflict with the testimony of multiple other physicians and experts. While granting credibility to all involved medical professionals, the court will conclude that it is unreasonable for all other examined physicians to fail to detect such serious conditions if they were as pronounced as Dr. Bailey suggested.

The court will find that if appellee Daniel's condition was not the result of carbon monoxide gas poisoning, as Dr. Bailey adamantly testified, then all other medical evidence will indicate that his current condition would not have been caused by gas exposure. This conclusion is supported by the substantial and consistent testimonies of various chemists who asserted that the crude petroleum oil in its natural state does not produce carbon monoxide gas, and as such, carbon monoxide gas would not have been present in the tank Daniel was cleaning when he was exposed to harmful gases.

As a result, any claim of serious ongoing condition caused by the inhalation of carbon monoxide gas will be considered improbable as per the expert evidence presented. The appellate court will determine that the jury's verdict on damages cannot be maintained owing to the substantial doubt raised regarding the permanence and cause of Daniel's conditions, and the absence of carbon monoxide gas as a potential cause. Therefore, the case will be sent back for a new trial due to the inconclusive nature of the evidence regarding the extent of damages that can be justly awarded to the appellee."
"A mother (appellant) filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a motel owner (appellee) following the drowning of her son, Ned Harris, in the motel's swimming pool. The case was heard in the 14th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), where a directed take nothing verdict was entered in favor of the motel owner, which meant that the mother received no compensation or relief from the court.

The mother contested that the motel owner was negligent due to the absence of a lifeguard, a lack of warning regarding the absence of a lifeguard, and non-compliance with Dallas City Ordinance No. 8479, which required certain safety equipment, including a ""life pole or shepherd's crook type of pole,"" to be available at the pool. According to evidence, although there were two aluminum poles at the pool that bystanders used in an attempt to rescue her son, these poles did not have a hook or other pulling device, as arguably required by the ordinance.

Ned Harris had been swimming with others during an event called Explo '72. On the night of the incident, he began to struggle in the pool and called for help. His companions and other bystanders attempted to rescue him using the available aluminum poles, which lacked hooks or pulling devices, therefore they could only push him towards the shallow end. Despite their efforts, the rescue was delayed, and Ned Harris could not be revived once pulled from the water.

The interpretation of ""life pole"" as mentioned in the ordinance emerged as a key issue, with the mother's position supported by testimony from a city health department official who confirmed that ""life pole"" and ""shepherd's crook"" are synonymous and imply a pole with a U-shaped end designed for pulling.","The court will reverse the directed take nothing verdict, concluding that the appellant mother presented a case justifiable for a jury to decide on the negligence and proximate cause regarding the motel owner's failure to provide a life pole according to the Dallas City Ordinance. The court will find that the verdict was improper because a life pole with a hook or other pulling device is technically different than a straight aluminum pole, which was what was provided.

The verdict will rely on the principle that if a local ordinance, aimed at preventing drowning by requiring a life pole that is suitable for lifesaving activities, is violated due to the absence of the necessary pole with pulling facilities, such a violation constitutes negligence per se. The evidence, including testimony, suggests that had proper equipment been available, a more rapid rescue could have been achieved, thus potentially preventing Ned Harris's drowning.

The court will also address the concept of proximate cause, suggesting there is sufficient evidence to infer that the lack of the correct life pole could have contributed to the inability to rescue the drowning victim in a timely manner. With this in mind, the mother will be entitled to have the negligence and the causal link between the motel owner’s actions and Ned Harris's death examined by a jury. Proximate cause, being a typical jury question, especially in cases where direct evidence of a rescue being possible is unlikely, will be considered as being based on the evidence that quick intervention could lead to successful resuscitation in many drowning incidents.

Given these points, the court will determine there was enough evidence presented to proceed to a jury on both negligence in the context of the ordinance and the proximate cause of Ned Harris's death. Thus, the mother's appeal will be successful, with the case remanded for a new trial where the jury will be tasked with deciding the issues laid out."
"The incident in question involves a collision between a butane truck, owned by appellant J. E. Reddick and driven by his driver, J. T. Abbott, and a produce truck. Following the collision, the butane truck caught fire and rolled into a ditch and up onto a railroad. The appellee, Ward Longacre, witnessed the incident and, seeing Abbott slumped over the wheel and appearing unconscious, bravely rescued him from the burning butane truck. However, as a result of the rescue effort, Longacre was injured when the truck subsequently exploded. Longacre then sued Reddick and Abbott for his injuries. 

Reddick and Abbott, suggesting that the collision was caused by the negligence of the produce truck's driver, filed for contribution against the second truck's owners and operators, Bailey, McCurdy, and Jackson. The trial court found in favor of the rescuer, Longacre, and against Reddick and Abbott. It also denied recovery for contribution from Bailey, McCurdy, and Jackson, thus rejecting the motions by Reddick and Abbott for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury.

The court noted that the jury was asked to resolve a factual dispute concerning the movement of the butane truck and the actions of the produce truck driver to avoid a head-on collision. The jury answered several issues, determining that Abbott was negligent in various ways such as driving on the wrong side of the road, failing to stop, and failing to keep a proper lookout. The jury found that these negligent acts were proximate causes of Longacre's injuries. Additionally, the jury found that Abbott had discovered a perilous situation in time to avoid the accident but failed to do so, which was also a proximate cause of injuries to the rescuer.

The jury determined that Longacre acted correctly in his attempt to rescue Abbott, holding that one who attempts to rescue another cannot be found contributorily negligent unless he or she acts in a rash or imprudent manner. The jury also determined that Longacre did not act rashly or assume risk when aiding Abbott. Contributions from the owner and operator of the produce truck were denied because their actions were not found negligent. They were also found to have acted in a way that a reasonable and prudent person would under similar circumstances.","The appeals court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court explained that the jury had thoroughly reviewed the facts and resolved whether the driver of the produce truck was negligent and whether the truck's sudden leftward movement to avoid a collision was a reasonable and prudent action. As determined by the jury’s fact-finding role, their verdict was against Reddick and his driver, establishing that Longacre was entitled to damages. 

The appellant Reddick's liability was justified because the negligence of his driver, Abbott, while acting within the scope of his employment, was legally chargeable to Reddick. The principle of rescue applied, deeming that one who attempts to aid someone in imminent peril is not contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Longacre's actions were deemed neither rash nor imprudent.

The court opined that the failure to stop, failure to keep a proper lookout, and failure to keep the truck under control were prima facie negligent acts that contributed to Longacre's injuries. The court disregarded the argument that Longacre assumed the risk because he did not act rashly when attempting the rescue. Similarly, the court rejected the contention that an emergency situation absolved the defendants of their negligence.

The court also upheld the jury's determination that no new and independent cause, which could absolve the defendants of liability, was presented. The judgment in favor of the appellee Longacre for $20,000.00 was affirmed because the evidence supported the jury's findings, and it was clear that all acts of negligence committed by Abbott were chargeable to Reddick. There were no errors in the trial court's proceedings, and appellants' points were either overruled or found to be irrelevant to the outcome of the case."
"The case in question involves the Rubio family (appellants, hereinafter referred to as ""the Rubios"") appealing against the 135th District Court of Victoria County, Texas, which granted summary judgment in favor of Guadalupe Martinez (appellee, hereinafter ""Martinez""). The legal action by the Rubios stemmed from the wrongful death and survival actions that were related to negligent entrustment and negligence against both the driver Juan Lopez (hereinafter ""Lopez""), and Martinez, the vehicle owner, involving an accident and subsequent death of Jose Rubio, who was rear-ended by a car driven by Lopez but owned by Martinez. Martinez was not present in the car at the time of the accident. Post-accident, Lopez fled the scene and his whereabouts remain unknown to Martinez. Jose Rubio was not found to be physically injured at the time of the accident following an investigation by the Victoria Police Department. Yet, approximately 26 days later, Jose Rubio committed suicide. 

The Rubios alleged negligent entrustment, claiming Martinez allowed an admittedly untrained, unlicensed, and incompetent driver to operate her vehicle. Martinez's primary defense was that Jose's committing suicide was the sole cause of his death, negating the liability of the owner of the vehicle involved in the preceding accident. Martinez filed for both traditional and no-evidence motions for summary judgment, with the court granting summary judgment as to the Rubios' wrongful death and survival claims, severing the claimed wrongful death and survival causes of action from the claims of negligent entrustment and negligence.

The Rubios contended that the court erred in granting the no-evidence motion for summary judgment for Martinez, claiming she provided implied consent to Lopez because of their dating relationship. They also argued that the suicide defense should not apply, as Martinez failed to establish it as a matter of law, and contested the striking of Paula Escobar's affidavit along with the enforcement of a supposed Rule 11 agreement regarding the scheduling of a summary judgment hearing post Martinez’s deposition, although the relevant documents were not presented in the appeal record.","The judgment will likely be affirmed due to failure on the part of the Rubios to present adequate evidence to counter the no-evidence summary judgment and to demonstrate that Martinez either expressly or impliedly entrusted her vehicle to Lopez. The court will find that the Rubios provided no evidence to suggest that Martinez foresaw or had any knowledge of Lopez being unlicensed, incompetent, or reckless that would raise a legitimate issue on Martinez's part regarding negligent entrustment. 

Furthermore, considering the affirmative defense of suicide, the court will determine that Martinez successfully established that the suicide of Jose Rubio was the sole cause of damage and death, unconnected to the earlier accident or any action of Martinez. As the Rubios' cause of action for wrongful death accrued upon the death of Jose Rubio, and the evidence including the death certificate and the accident report confirmed suicide independently of the accident, the burden shifted to the Rubios to raise an issue of fact showing that the suicide was caused by Martinez’s failure to comply with a legal standard – a burden they did not meet.

The court will dismiss Paula Escobar's affidavit as it did not relate to Martinez's negligence or liability and thus would not affect the summary judgment determination. Regarding the claimed Rule 11 agreement, the absence of documentation in the appellate record would lead the court to presume the correctness of the trial court's actions, dismissing that issue as well.

In conclusion, the appellate court will hold that Martinez is not culpable based on the evidence provided for the negligent entrustment, demonstrating that Martinez is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the Rubios' arguments on all issues presented in their appeal will be overruled, sustaining the trial court’s initial ruling."
"Philip Benoit, the owner and manager of a tourist camp, was the defendant in a wrongful death case brought by the family of Robert L. Wilson, Jr. (consisting of widow Mrs. Garnitt Wilson, her two minor children, and Robert L. Wilson, Sr.), who died as a result of an explosion of gas in a tourist cabin at Benoit's camp on March 23, 1947. The deceased had checked into the camp, housed in Cabin No. 22, and was noticed to be intoxicated upon his return to the cabin after a brief departure. Eventually, an explosion occurred the following morning, leading to Wilson's death from injuries sustained.

The plaintiff's case alleged negligence by Benoit due to the maintenance of a natural gas heater connected via a flexible rubber and fabric hose, contrary to a Waco city ordinance prohibiting such connections. During the trial, the jury found that the use of this prohibited hose and Wilson's intoxicated state were both proximate causes of the explosion and his death. Based on these findings, the trial court rendered a judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing. The Court of Civil Appeals, however, reversed this judgment and found in favor of the Wilson family, holding that three intoxication special issues relating to Wilson's intoxicated condition should not have been submitted to the jury. Subsequently, the court also reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case for a new trial, on the basis that the intoxication issues were submitted on an erroneous theory. 

The case involved extensive testimonies concerning Wilson's actions before the explosion, the condition and placement of the gas heater hose, the specifics of the gas explosion, and investigations following the incident. There was also significant legal debate over whether the evidence presented justified the submission of several special issues to the jury, particularly those related to Wilson's intoxication and the act of disconnecting the rubber hose from the gas jet.","The judgments from the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals will be reversed, and the case will be remanded to the trial court for a new trial. The reasons for such a decision will be based on the conclusion that the special issues relative to the intoxication of the deceased, Robert L. Wilson, Jr., were submitted to the jury upon an incorrect legal theory.

The evidence indicates negligence per se due to the prohibited use of a flexible hose for the gas connection, as it contravenes a city ordinance. The jury will have reasonably inferred that the hose was a proximate cause of the explosion and Wilson's death, given the uncontroverted fact of the explosion and a sufficient presence of gas in the cabin to cause it. The jury is deemed to have rightfully considered all facts and circumstances when making its determination, and the role of the jury as the exclusive fact-finder will be respected.

However, the issues of intoxication submitted to the jury will be found not to have been justified since the evidence does not sufficiently support a finding that Wilson's intoxicated condition contributed to or was a proximate cause of the explosion. The only acts proven regarding Wilson are considered normal and cannot be established as negligent nor as contributory factors to the explosion.

Finally, justice will be said to demand a new trial based on the improper presentation of intoxication issues to the jury and the potential for facts that were not fully developed or presented due to the trial being conducted under a wrong legal theory. Moreover, the Court of Civil Appeals' decision to reverse and render, rather than remand for a new trial, will be said to be incorrect because a rendering of judgment would only be justified when the record unambiguously shows that the case tried under the correct theory would not have provided sufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to recover. Therefore, the need for a retrial will be deemed evident to ascertain the material facts and to ensure proper justice."
"Russell Engledove, an employee of O. L. Gregory Vinegar Company, died while attempting to rescue a fellow employee, Thomas Nelson, from a vinegar vat filled with poisonous gas. The incident occurred on October 29, 1914, during a regular cleaning process necessary for the vinegar manufacturing operation. Engledove, while eating his lunch, responded to a cry for help from Herman Ingram, the company's foreman, and disregarded warnings about the danger. He wrapped a saturated gunny sack around his head and entered the vat to assist Nelson, successfully attaching a hook and rope to Nelson's belt for extraction. However, Engledove was overcome by the gas and perished.

Appellant, the General Accident, Fire & Life Assurance Corporation, Limited, an insurance carrier for the vinegar company, contested the claim that Engledove was acting within the scope of his employment when he died, thus challenging an award set by the Industrial Accident Board of Texas, favoring Engledove’s widow, Alice Engledove, and their minor children. Appellant's position was that Engledove's actions were contrary to express commands from superiors and thus situating him outside the scope of employment and eligibility for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Texas.","The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, upholding the judgment confirming the award by the Industrial Accident Board. The rationale was that where an employee's life is jeopardized through the employer's negligence, a third-party, who intervenes to rescue them, is not simply volunteering but is acting in the interest of the employer. Thus, their actions are within the scope of employment, and eligibility for compensation follows. Engledove's intervention was seen as an attempt to preserve life that was in the vinegary company's interest, as employers depend on the lives and labor of employees. Whether Engledove's actions were against a direct command was for the trial court to determine, and the court found no commanding evidence to suggest such instruction was given as an authoritative command, but rather as a suggestion of danger. If a command were proven, the question arose whether that would render Engledove's action outside the scope of employment and disentitle benefits under the Act—a perspective that wasn’t definitively concluded. However, the court opined that a servant's violation of a master's orders, while acting within their employment scope, might not deny them compensation claims.

Finally, the court also addressed the legality of the judgment itself regarding installment liabilities, affirming that the compensatory approach aligns with the statute and that due execution can be enforced if installments are not voluntarily paid. The judgment was fully upheld as the court concluded that Engledove was entitled to compensation, and the decision of the Industrial Accident Board stood as conclusive and final, with the trial court's judgment affirmed."
"This medical malpractice case involves the wrongful death action against McAllen Hospitals, L.P., and McAllen Medical Center, Inc., collectively referred to as ""the Hospital,"" and Dr. Shahid Rashid. The appellees are the surviving spouse and children of Mr. Muniz, the deceased patient. After having his lower left leg amputated, Mr. Muniz suffered from pain, which was managed by Darvocet until Dr. Rashid prescribed a patient-control analgesia pump (PCA) to deliver Dilaudid (an opiate) intravenously. The administration of Dilaudid was not monitored adequately; dosage amounts were not recorded following its initiation by Nurse Duque. Hours after the PCA began, Mr. Muniz was found unresponsive with no pulse or respirations and subsequently pronounced dead.

The appellees’ expert witness, Dr. Rosner, testified that Mr. Muniz's death resulted from cardio-respiratory arrest due to the sedating effects of Dilaudid, which were compounded by his existing conditions (CHF, CAD, COPD). Dr. Rosner asserted that Mr. Muniz had exhibited sensitivity to opiates post-surgery, and that proper monitoring while on Dilaudid could have prevented his death. The Hospital challenged Dr. Rosner's testimony as speculative, claiming the expert’s reliance on mere assumptions and a lack of a reliable foundation under Tex. R. Evid. 702.

The trial court denied the Hospital's motions, including a motion for directed verdict, and the jury determined that the Hospital's negligence was the proximate cause of Mr. Muniz's death, while returning a verdict in favor of Dr. Rashid.","The verdict in favor of the appellees will likely be upheld on appeal. The reasoning for this verdict will rest on the conclusion that Dr. Rosner's expert testimony was both reliable and legally sufficient to support the jury’s finding. It will be determined that Dr. Rosner's opinion was grounded in his review of Mr. Muniz’s medical record, his professional experience as an anesthesiologist specializing in pain management, and knowledge in the field. The appellate court will perceive that he utilized objective criteria to reach his conclusion that the Hospital's failure to monitor Mr. Muniz's vital signs and oxygen saturation after administering Dilaudid was the proximate cause of his death.

The appellate court will find no ""analytical gap"" between the data and Dr. Rosner's opinion that would render his testimony as mere speculation or unsupported. The verdict will argue that the jury was within its rights to credit the testimony of Dr. Rosner over the Hospital's expert, Dr. Pallares, who had a differing interpretation of the medical records, and that the evidence presented furnished a reasonable basis for the jury's conclusion on causation.

Additionally, the verdict will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the evidence was factually sufficient. The jury's role as the sole judge of credibility and the weight of testimony will be acknowledged, and it will be conceded that they reasonably believed Dr. Rosner's opinion on causation. Therefore, the verdict of the trial court will be affirmed, finding the Hospital's negligence as a substantial factor that resulted in Mr. Muniz's death and that the harm would not have occurred if the Hospital had not been negligent in monitoring Mr. Muniz post-Dilaudid administration."
"Petitioner decedent's survivors (Mrs. Patricia Biggers and her children) filed an action against respondents (Continental Bus Company, bus driver Jack Lanham, other driver Betty Joe Epps Gross, and her husband) for damages resulting from a collision between the decedent’s automobile, driven by Enoch A. Biggers, Jr., and a passenger bus. The case came to trial, and the jury found the bus driver guilty of negligence leading to the collision, awarding damages to the plaintiffs. However, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed this judgment in part, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing against the bus company on the grounds that none of the negligent acts of the bus driver was a proximate cause of the collision. This verdict was affirmed by a previous judgment of the Supreme Court. 

The decisive event occurred on December 20, 1951, at about 8:52 a.m. on Highway 75 near Huntsville, Texas. The decedent, Enoch A. Biggers, Jr., was killed when his vehicle was hit from behind by a car driven by Betty Joe Epps (now Gross), propelling his car into the path of an oncoming bus, driven by Jack Lanham and owned by Continental Bus Company. Three vehicles had been proceeding in a southbound direction - first, a Hudson car; second, the Ford driven by Mr. Biggers; and third, the Chevrolet driven by Mrs. Gross. The collision occurred as the Hudson car slowed down near a bridge to check the fishing conditions, causing Mr. Biggers to brake and Mrs. Gross to lose control of her vehicle, impacting the rear of Mr. Biggers’ Ford and propelling it into the opposite lane where the bus was traveling northbound.

The bus driver was found negligent by the jury for failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to apply brakes, driving at an excessive rate of speed, and driving at a speed in excess of 55 miles per hour. Each act of negligence was found to be a proximate cause of the collision. The bus driver was not found to have been acting in an emergency created by other than his own negligence, and the driver of the Hudson was absolved of all charges of negligence. The collision was not deemed an unavoidable accident. Mrs. Gross was found guilty of certain negligent acts each of which was also found to be a proximate cause of the collision. Biggers was absolved of all charges of negligence and he was found to have acted in an emergency after the Ford was hit by the Chevrolet. Liabilities connected to discovered peril were dismissed as it was concluded there was no opportunity for the bus driver to avoid the collision after discovering the peril of the deceased.

The trial court awarded the plaintiffs damages against Continental and Mrs. Gross and her husband, jointly and severally, and denied the bus company and Mrs. Gross any indemnity against each other.

On appeal, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the trial court judgment as regards the bus company stating that there was no evidence of proximate cause and the plaintiffs were therefore entitled to nothing from Continental Bus Company. It was upon this background that the outcome, that follows, was to be predicated.","The ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals that exonerated the bus company will be reversed if there is any evidence of probative value in the record supporting any one of the findings of proximate cause. The court will disregard any evidence in the analysis that does not support the jury’s findings and will focus solely on the evidence that supports the verdict, as per the established boundaries of duty imposed by decisions of the Supreme Court.

A finding of proximate cause necessitates both foreseeability and causation. Continental's contention that foreseeability is absent in this case because an operator of an automobile cannot be required to foresee that another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction may enter the wrong traffic lane is rejected based on prior case law establishing that excessive speed, when encountering another automobile even if it were in the wrong traffic lane, could stand as a proximate cause of a collision. It is not beyond reason for a driver to anticipate that a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction may enter the wrong traffic lane, even if the entry is due to non-negligent reasons such as skidding on a wet roadway or because of being struck by another vehicle.

Addressing the argument that the bus driver is not reasonably expected to foresee the specific circumstances that led the Ford to be propelled into his lane, the Supreme Court precedent establishes that it is adequate for liability if, as a person of ordinary intelligence, he should have reasonably anticipated the danger created by his negligence, without needing to foresee the exact manner of the injury resultantly. There is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the excessive speed at which the bus was traveling was a proximate cause of the collision.

The contention that the collision would have happened regardless of the bus's speed can be found not compounds given the evidence shows an excessive speed would have limited the driver's ability to take evasive actions or stop the bus. Factoring the estimated speeds of the vehicles and the distances covered and aligning them with the time calculated, a reasonable jury could conclude that had the bus been traveling at a lawful and non-negligent speed, the collision might have been averted.

Given the established duty to operate a vehicle at a reasonable speed considering the circumstances and that a chain of cars was approaching, it is likely concluded that the reactions required by the bus driver could only have been achieved at a lower speed, thus asserting that the bus’s excessive speed did contribute to the collision and hence holds the requisite qualities of a proximate cause. It is irrelevant to Continental's liability that Mrs. Gross's negligence also contributed to the accident, assuming it fulfills the criterion of a substantial factor in bringing about the collision, as it certainly seems to do.

The Court of Civil Appeals’ judgment in favor of Continental must be reversed because it rested on the ground that as a matter of law none of the bus driver's negligent acts was a proximate cause, which is contradictory to what is supported by evidence of probative force. Additionally, the Court of Civil Appeals should be directed to consider the other points of error raised by Continental that were not considered because of the court's conclusion on the ""no evidence"" issue. As regards the bus company's additional point of error regarding the jury's verdict being so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong, this will need due consideration by the Court of Civil Appeals, with the proper approach being the independent evaluation of the evidence on this point, unimpaired by the court's conclusion on the lack of proximate cause. If the evidence is found lacking, a reversal and remand for retrial might be in order.

Consequently, it is probable that the Supreme Court will set aside its prior judgment affirming the appellate court's judgment, reverse the appellate court's judgment reversing the trial court's judgment for the survivors, and remand to the appellate court for further proceedings consistent with these logical deductions and analyses. Mrs. Gross's application for relief will likely be found without merit and thus denied."
"On October 16, 2000, a helicopter owned by Duke University Medical Center and operated by CJ Systems Aviation Group (CJ), crashed due to the main rotor gearbox failure after roughly three and half hours of operation post overhaul. The gearbox had been overhauled by American Eurocopter Corporation (American). Following the crash, multiple lawsuits were pursued: the family of the deceased pilot sued American; Duke University's insurer sued American for the helicopter loss; and American settled with the pilot's family for $2,250,000. American then initiated a third-party suit against CJ for contractual indemnity to recover the settlement amount and attorney's fees from the previous cases. Additionally, American sought indemnification for defective work done by CJ. CJ counterclaimed for breach of warranty regarding the failed gearbox. The jury found that while CJ's work resulted in a loss to American, CJ's negligence was not solely responsible for the crash. They also found that American's negligence proximately caused the accident. On CJ's warranty claim, the jury found American breached the warranty and CJ's damages were $78,935.62. The trial court rendered judgment denying American's claims against CJ and awarding CJ on its breach of warranty claim.","The appeals court predicts the judgment will be affirmed based on several key considerations. The jury's finding that American's negligence was a proximate cause of the accident will stand because the evidence sufficiently indicates that American could have foreseen the actions of CJ's mechanic and pilot operating the aircraft with the oil-pressure warning light illuminated, given the general industry practices. Furthermore, the court will note that the gearbox's imminent failure, due to American's negligence, remained a persistent danger that did not come to rest with the aircraft's safe landing during the crash night.

Regarding the indemnity agreement, the court will determine that the express negligence doctrine applies, meaning any agreement to indemnify for one's own negligence must be stated in clear and unambiguous terms within the contract. The indemnity clause does not clearly and unequivocally require CJ to indemnify American for its own negligence or their concurrent negligence, thus barring American's claim for indemnity. The court will find that American's argument that it is seeking indemnification for consequences of CJ's negligence, not its own, is not persuasive because both parties' negligence contributed to the crash.

On the breach of warranty issue, the court will rule that evidence substantiates CJ's claim that flying the aircraft with the warning light off did not violate the warranty's terms. American's contention that CJ was not entitled to monetary damages because the warranty exclusively limited recovery to repair or replacement will be deemed waived because American did not object to the damages question or CJ's failure to obtain a jury finding on the limitation of remedy's failing of its essential purpose. There is, moreover, some evidence that the warranty's limitation of remedy did indeed fail of its essential purpose, as the gearbox could not be returned for repair or replacement due to its destruction in the crash.

The court will predict that all of American's issues on appeal will be overruled, leading to the affirmation of the trial court's judgment in favor of CJ Systems Aviation Group."
"Constance Christie, the appellant patient, sued doctors Jim Gilmore, M.D. and Sue Ellen Cox, M.D., claiming medical malpractice, failure to obtain informed consent, and gross negligence following facial plastic surgery. Dr. Cox filed a ""no evidence"" motion for summary judgment, maintaining she was not negligent and had no duty to obtain informed consent as Christie was not her patient. Later, Dr. Gilmore also filed a ""no evidence"" motion, contending Christie couldn't raise a material issue of fact regarding allegations against him. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both Dr. Cox and Dr. Gilmore without specifying reasons.

The appeal focused on whether Christie provided enough evidence to establish the breach of standard care and proximate cause for her claims. It was determined that Christie failed to raise a material fact issue regarding standard of care and proximate cause for her claims against Dr. Cox. Specifically, Christie did not present expert testimony elucidating the standard of care Dr. Cox allegedly breached or how any such breach proximately caused her damages.

Similarly, concerning Dr. Gilmore's actions, Christie did not establish a standard of care through expert testimony, a necessary component to assert medical negligence. Furthermore, her claims of Gilmore's gross negligence regarding purported medical record alterations and allowing an untrained colleague to participate in the surgery lacked evidentiary support.

However, Christie did raise a material fact issue regarding the informed consent claim against Dr. Gilmore. She provided testimony that she signed a blank consent form under pressure from Gilmore's nurses who misrepresented the form as ""informal"" rather than ""informed"" consent. Christie alleged she was not aware of all the procedures performed nor the risks involved, and she stated she would not have consented to the surgery had she been fully informed of the risks. Additionally, testimony was provided that Christie suffered from asymmetry and heavy scarring following the surgery – risks she was not informed about.","The judgment will be affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The decision will favor Dr. Cox entirely, and she will prevail on all claims against her because Christie failed to produce evidence of negligence or informed consent issues related to Dr. Cox. 

However, the verdict will be different for Dr. Gilmore. While the judgment will be affirmed regarding Christie's claims of medical malpractice and gross negligence, since she was unable to establish a standard of care through expert testimony and there was no evidence of gross negligence, the judgment will be reversed with respect to the informed consent claim. This reversal is because Christie raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether informed consent was properly obtained by Dr. Gilmore. She demonstrated through testimony that she was pressured to sign the consent form without being fully informed of the procedures and risks, which is a breach of the standard care for informed consent. Christie's claims show that a reasonable person might refuse treatment if fully informed, and she alleged injuries as a result of risks she was not made aware of. The informed consent claim will be remanded for a trial to determine if the lack of informed consent led to Christie's injuries."
"Juli Bliskey, the appellee, resided at Wilderock Townhomes in Corpus Christi, Texas. She experienced a traumatic sexual assault in her townhome perpetrated by an intruder who gained entry using a key to her front door. The assailant informed Bliskey that he had obtained her key and lease information by breaking into the property management office of Wilderock Townhomes. He searched resident files for single women with good jobs and found Bliskey's information, corresponding her lease with her clearly identified apartment key, which he took from a pegboard displaying all the residents' keys.

Bliskey subsequently sued various entities, including the owners of her specific townhome, other Berry entities, and their owner, Annette Berry, for negligence and deceptive trade practices under Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 17.43 (1987). She claimed that Berry Property Management, Inc. (appellant), as one of the managers, negligently handled its residents' keys and violated the DTPA by failing to provide appropriate door locks as required by statute and promised by the lease. The jury found in favor of Bliskey, awarding both compensatory and punitive damages. Both sides filed post-verdict motions, but the final judgment awarded damages to Bliskey based on the verdict, subject to modifications regarding attorneys' fees and interest. The trial court overruled appellant's motion for a new trial. Appellant contested the judgment, and Bliskey cross-appealed on issues related to attorneys' fees.

Notably, while in prison, the assailant had managed to escape but was quickly recaptured and returned to jail. This escape factored into the case in terms of exacerbating Bliskey's mental anguish and affecting the resulting damages. Initially, questions regarding jury size arose when one juror was excused after expressing concern about potential bias due to a personal connection with an insurance agent involved with a defendant Berry entity. However, the trial proceeded with eleven jurors, as minimal jurors' impairment was considered, and the verdict was rendered unanimously.","In predicting the verdict of Bliskey's lawsuit against Berry Property Management for negligence, the court will likely affirm the judgment for appellee, Bliskey, finding sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination that Berry's negligent handling of keys led to her assault. The court will address the components of negligence: duty, breach, and proximate cause.

The court will ascertain that Berry owed a duty of reasonable care based on foreseeable risk due to the management policy of having keys to tenants' exterior door locks. It will be concluded that the jury reasonably found Berry's storage methods of residents' keys and files provided an unreasonable risk of harm that was foreseeable. This conclusion will be bolstered by expert testimony acknowledging the inadequacy of Berry's security measures and the acknowledgment by Annette Berry that such assaults do occur and are foreseeable.

On causation, Bliskey will need to show Berry's conduct was a ""but for"" cause of her harm and that Berry should have anticipated the danger created by its negligence. The court will reject Berry's argument that the criminal's conduct was an unforeseeable superseding cause, finding instead that Berry's mismanagement of keys and rental information was sufficiently concerning to foresee potential criminal misuse.

In addressing the deceptive trade practices claim, Berry's argument that Bliskey failed to prove a misleading act or practice relating to the lease agreement and security devices will not prevail, as the court will find the lease represented an obligation to provide a night latch upon request, which was not fulfilled.

Berry's contention that there cannot be double recovery of actual and punitive damages under both common law and the DTPA for the same act will fail, as the court will find that separate and distinct damages were assessed for Berry's negligence and deceptive acts, justifying distinct awards for each. The jury's decision to award attorneys' fees as a percentage of damages will be deemed appropriate, ensuring Bliskey's recovery is not diminished by legal expenses.

Ultimately, the court will modify the judgment to eliminate the double recovery of prejudgment interest on attorneys' fees but will uphold the remaining judgment based on ample evidence supporting the findings of negligence and deception. The court will also require the application of the co-defendants' settlement to be before calculating prejudgment interest. Berry's federal constitutional due process rights and Texas constitutional excessive fines claim regarding punitive damages will not be found to have been violated, and the punitive damages assessed will be considered reasonable based on the circumstances of the case."
"In May 1980, Dr. Francisco Ruiz-Ortiz performed a lumpectomy and reconstructive surgery on Sue Tuley, during which he implanted silicone breast implants. Prior to the surgery, Tuley specifically requested saline implants and reasserted her preference to Ruiz-Ortiz by stating she did not want silicone implants. Ruiz-Ortiz assured her she would receive saline implants. However, in 1992, Tuley, while undergoing a mammogram with Ruiz-Ortiz, questioned him about the implants, and he reassured her that they were indeed saline. Two years later, in 1994, while Tuley was having an MRI for upper respiratory problems, it was discovered that the implants were, in fact, silicone, and evidence indicated that at least one implant had ruptured. The removal of these implants left Tuley with scarring and disfigurement. Tuley initiated a lawsuit against Ruiz-Ortiz and several Dow Corning entities claiming multiple causes of action, including misrepresentation, breach of warranty, and failure to provide informed consent. 

Tuley's lawsuit against Ruiz-Ortiz specifically highlighted the failure to provide informed consent. After the suit against the Dow parties was moved to federal court, Ruiz-Ortiz filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion, claiming Tuley failed to provide expert medical testimony to support her allegations, as required for proving standard medical care breach and proximate cause. Tuley responded to the motion without an expert medical report, contending instead that Ruiz-Ortiz's use of silicone instead of saline implants was evident of battery and that this did not require an expert report to establish the breach of the agreed-upon procedure. Following this, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Ruiz-Ortiz. Tuley subsequently filed a new motion for trial, this time invoking the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), but this was denied.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court likely reasoned that the convincing burden for a medical malpractice claim, based on negligence in failing to disclose risks, lies in proving breach of duty and proximate cause through medical testimony, as established under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (MLIIA). However, Tuley did not provide expert testimony supporting her claim, rendering her evidence legally insufficient. 

Even though Tuley tried to argue that her claim stemmed from the pre-amendment DTPA rather than negligence, she cited the case Sorokolit v. Rhodes in her defense. In Sorokolit, the claim was based not on negligence but on a guarantee of surgical results. This was different from Tuley's case, where warranty and misrepresentation claims were directed against Dow corporations, not Ruiz-Ortiz. Tuley's claims against Ruiz-Ortiz solely pertained to the alleged breach of duty to disclose and obtain informed consent, which tracks the language and requirements of the MLIIA and not the DTPA.

From the court's viewpoint, Tuley's late invocation of the DTPA did not convert her medical malpractice claim, which lacked the requisite medical expert report, into a viable DTPA claim against Ruiz-Ortiz. Since Tuley's claim against Ruiz-Ortiz did not contain allegations of an express warranty of a particular result or knowing misrepresentation as articulated in the DTPA, but rather centered on breach of informed consent, the summary judgment was seen as appropriate. The court was likely to emphasize that Tuley's failure to submit the required expert report on standard medical care was fatal to her negligence claim. Thus, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, supporting Ruiz-Ortiz's summary judgment based on no evidence provided by Tuley that fulfilled the legal standards for medical malpractice under Texas law."
"The appellant, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), manufactured silicone gel breast implants and distributed them to plastic surgeons from the late 1970s to the 1980s. 3M acquired McGhan, a company formed to produce medical implants, in 1977. The package inserts for the implants included warnings about capsular contracture, rupture, and leakage. Four plaintiffs, Danna Atterbury, Lynne Bliven Overbey, Sherry Bonds, and Patricia Stewart, used 3M's implants in breast augmentation procedures between 1979 and 1984, and subsequently experienced a variety of health issues they attributed to the implants. They had the implants removed between 1994 and 1995 and sued 3M for negligence and products liability.

A jury found that the breast implants had the marketing, manufacturing, and design defects when they left the manufacturer and that these defects caused the plaintiffs’ illnesses or injuries. The jury also found 3M both negligent and grossly negligent, with this negligence being the proximate cause of the plaintiffs’ issues. The jury verdict awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the plaintiffs. However, 3M filed motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing the plaintiffs lacked sufficient reliable scientific evidence that silicone breast implants caused their specific injuries and illnesses, and that they did not offer sufficient evidence for an award of punitive damages.

In this appeal case, concerning the sufficiency and reliability of scientific evidence required for causation in product liability cases, several critical aspects were analyzed. The considerations included whether 3M waived its right to appeal due to insufficient causation evidence by not objecting to the jury question on ""illness versus injury,"" and a discussion about the reliability of expert witness testimony and the standard for admitting such testimony. The assessment of evidence reliability involved a detailed analysis of epidemiological studies and expert testimony presented by the plaintiffs’ experts - Dr. Robert Herndon, Dr. Jeffrey Gross, and Dr. Mitchell Forman, and examined their methodologies, qualifications, and the strength of their scientific conclusions regarding causation. The evaluation was guided by the legal precedents set in cases like Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, and Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, adopting factors to determine scientific reliability, such as peer review, potential rate of error, and general acceptance in the scientific community.

The appeals court determined that the appellants did not waive their claims regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support a causation finding, and went on to scrutinize the evidence presented by the plaintiffs' experts using the principles from Daubert, Robinson, and Havner. The court found the epidemiological studies cited by the plaintiffs non-conclusive and the expert testimonies not based on recognized scientific methods, thus not sufficiently reliable to establish generial causation. The court concluded that without reliable proof of general causation, no evidence could support the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.","The court would reason that in order to uphold a jury's determination of causation in a product liability case, reliable scientific evidence must be presented to demonstrate that an alleged harmful agent both can cause injury in the general population (general causation) and did cause injury to specific individuals (specific causation). Considering the facts of the case, the plaintiffs’ evidence was scrutinized for its scientific validity according to the standards established in cases such as Daubert and Havner. It would be noted that the expert testimony presented by the plaintiffs was insufficient to establish general causation because the methodologies used were not generally accepted in the scientific community and lacked peer-reviewed epidemiological support with appropriate levels of statistical significance.

Moreover, since the epidemiological studies cited were not found to be scientifically reliable or they did not demonstrate a sufficiently elevated risk of harm, they would not be deemed adequate to support the plaintiffs’ allegations. Additionally, the court would likely reject anecdotal case reports, differential diagnosis unsupported by reliable science, and personal experience of experts as singular bases for causal conclusions. The court would also consider other potential causes for the plaintiffs’ symptoms, which the experts' testimonies failed to rule out with reasonable certainty. Given that the requirements for proving both general and specific causation were not met, the court would rule that there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.

Taking all these into consideration, the court would reverse the judgment that had been entered in favor of the plaintiff implant patients, thus entering judgment in favor of the appellant manufacturer, 3M. The lack of reliable scientific evidence to prove general causation would be the central reason for reversing the jury's verdict and would underscore the importance of rigorous scientific methods and validation in establishing causation in product liability cases, especially where complex medical conditions and possible causal connections are involved."
"Juan Luis Argueta was a seaman on the shrimping vessel the Betty N, owned by Ricardo N., Inc. He jumped overboard in the middle of the night approximately eighty miles off the Texas coast. It is speculated that he was distressed over rumors of his wife's infidelity. After jumping, the crew radioed for help and searched for him throughout the night, but he was not found.

Argueta's wife, Maria Margarita Turcios de Argueta, filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself, Argueta's estate, and their four minor children, alleging negligence under the Jones Act (46 U.S.C.S. § 688) and unseaworthiness under the Death on the High Seas Act (46 U.S.C.S. § 761). The trial court ruled in favor of Turcios, awarding actual damages, punitive damages, and pre- and post-judgment interest. The court of appeals reversed the punitive damages and judgment against the vessel but affirmed the actual damages and interest against Ricardo N. The case then went to the Supreme Court of Texas for further review.

The trial court had determined that the Betty N was unseaworthy due to improper equipment and lack of crew training for emergencies. The ship did not have flares or cable cutters to jettison the nets in an emergency, and it was questionable if the ship's life preservers met Coast Guard regulation requirements. The crew members lacked emergency training, and safety materials were in English when only the rigman could read English. The use of sideband radios was unclear. The crew's response to the overboard incident lacked immediacy and the vessel lacked the proper emergency equipment, impacting the potential for a successful rescue operation.

Ricardo N. denied that adequate evidence supported findings of unseaworthiness and negligence but did not argue reversal based on this. Instead, Ricardo N. contended that there was no evidence the unseaworthiness and negligence could have caused Argueta's death.","Given that the plaintiff (Turcios) bore the burden of proving causation in both the Jones Act negligence claim and the unseaworthiness claim under the Death on the High Seas Act, and considering the available evidence, it is predicted that the court will rule that she failed to meet this burden. The verdict should assert that Turcios was required to demonstrate that the defendant's (Ricardo N., Inc.) actions or lack thereof, resulted in Argueta's death, but despite the light burden of proof required under the Jones Act (where a defendant's negligence only needs to contribute 'in the slightest degree'), Turcios could not establish causation.

The argument that the crew should have thrown flotation devices to Argueta will be dismissed on the basis that he was not visible once he entered the water, and that speculative actions without proof of causation are insufficient grounds for liability. The plaintiff’s own expert's testimony that even if everything had been executed perfectly by the Betty N, it would likely not have changed the outcome, will be particularly influential in determining the lack of causation.

The traditional requirement for proximate cause in unseaworthiness claims will not be met either, as no evidence will be able to show that the vessel's condition or the crew's actions could have prevented Argueta's death.

Additionally, the court will likely consider that Argueta's own actions in jumping overboard under risky conditions at night without a life vest made it extremely challenging for Ricardo N. to disprove causation. Thus, pursuant to cases like Britt v. Marine Transport Lines and Schlichter v. Port Arthur Towing, where the plaintiff's inability to prove causation resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants, the court will find that Ricardo N. did not breach any statutory or regulatory requirement, and equitable considerations do not favor a presumption of causation against them. As a result, the verdict rendered will be that Turcios should take nothing against Ricardo N., reversing the appellate ruling and affirming the judgment in favor of Ricardo N., Inc. to the extent permissible by the reviewed claims."
"The background of the case involves an employee, Ruby Arline, who, while in the employment of Consolidated Steel Corporation, alleged to have suffered an injury on April 16, 1946, when attempting to lift and empty a heavy steel barrel. He claimed this incident caused him such severe strain on his side and back, resulting in total incapacitation that prevented him from working and earning money. The incapacitation was said to have persisted since the date of the incident and would continue for a total of 145 weeks from that date. Arline abandoned claims related to an impairing vision in his left eye, admitting no injury to his eye occurred while he was employed by Consolidated Steel Corporation.

Pacific Indemnity Company, the insurer, contested the claim, suggesting that the employee's incapacitation was due to a later jaw infection which led to the removal of his eye, or due to previous pleurisy, rather than the claimed injury. The insurer proposed that any injury suffered by Arline would only result in temporary disability lasting at most 12 weeks if it had occurred on the claimed date, with all subsequent disability solely resulting from other non-compensable diseases or physical defects.

The central issue of the trial revolved around whether the severe physical strain alleged by the employee was the cause of his incapacitation, and, if so, to what extent it rendered him unable to work. The jury was instructed to determine the causation aspect under the terminology ""resulted in"" total incapacity—language that was not further defined by the trial court despite the insurer's contention that a comprehensive legal definition was necessary to avoid jury confusion. The jury ruled in favor of the employee, finding the injury did result in his total incapacity and awarded him compensation for the alleged period of 145 weeks.","The court affirmed the jury's verdict and overruled the insurer's motion for rehearing. The court held that the words ""resulted in"" within the given instructions were adequate in conveying the concept of causation to the jury and thus did not need further definition. The court reasoned that the use of ""resulted in"" in the jury instructions clearly submitted the issue of whether Arline's injury was causally connected to his claimed disability. 

The court also held that the term ""resulted in"" is not a legal term that always needs definition and that, on the evidentiary record presented, the jury could interpret the term to mean causation in fact—the injury being a substantial factor in bringing about the employee's disability. The insurer's contentions were overruled because the court found all ultimate issues of fact raised by the insurer's special pleas were indeed submitted to the jury. The verdict was affirmed because the jury had a sufficient basis to make their findings despite the insurer's argument to the contrary. The language of the court's charge to the jury, when considered in light of the evidence, was such that the jury would construe the issues properly and consider only incapacity they believed was caused by the employee's attempt to lift the barrel. Thus, the jury's findings on the specific issues involving injury, its effect, whether it led to total or partial incapacity, and duration of incapacitation were deemed appropriately addressed in the instructions, concluding that there was no likelihood that the jury misapplied the term ""resulted in"" to reach their verdict."
"Sinue Miranda, a clerk at the Handi Plus #17 convenience store, suffered injuries, which resulted in paralysis from the waist down, during an armed robbery on April 27, 2007. The Handi Plus #17 store is owned by Global New Millennium Partners (Global) and was leased to TriStar Convenience Stores, Inc. (TriStar), a subsidiary of Gulshan Enterprises, Inc. (Gulshan). Gulshan had a contract with Motiva Enterprises, LLC (Motiva) under which Gulshan could use the ""Shell"" brand name under the condition of compliance with the agreement's terms including the operation of outlets in a secure manner to prevent criminal activity.

TriStar subleased the convenience store to Bhanu, LLC with the business agreement involving the sale of motor fuel and an understanding that TriStar could enter the premises for inspections and other purposes. Bhanu was required to conduct business lawfully and ethically. It was expressly forbidden to install revenue-generating machines without TriStar's consent. The store had illegal gambling machines (""eight-liners"") owned by a third party, HNC Amusements, Inc., which were paid out in cash.

Miranda alleged that the presence of these gambling machines increased the risk of violent crime, like the robbery he experienced, and that there were previous instances of this. Managers from Bhanu and TriStar, including TriStar president Shoukat Dhanani, asserted that they either did not know about the machines or would have taken action had they known. A security expert opined that TriStar had a duty to ensure that illegal gambling did not occur and that their negligence in this matter increased the likelihood of the armed robbery.

Miranda sued TriStar and other entities for negligence, premises liability, negligent activity, and negligence per se. TriStar requested summary judgment, claiming Miranda could not establish the proximate cause between TriStar's alleged negligence and the robbery.","The trial court granted summary judgment in TriStar's favor, concluding that Miranda did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between TriStar's actions and the robbery. TriStar successfully argued that the assailant's conduct was uncontrollable by them and their connection to the property did not include management of substantive operations or security. TriStar further maintained that chapter 47 of the Penal Code, which addresses gambling, does not establish a basis for tort liability. 

Miranda, on the other hand, was unable to prove the foreseeability or causation of his injuries resulting from TriStar's failure to terminate the sublease based on the alleged illegal gambling. The prior instances of crime at or near the store did not rise to the same level of violence as the shooting and therefore did not indicate a likelihood of such an event occurring. The expert's opinion that the gambling machines increased the likelihood of violent crime was not backed by data comparing criminal activity in similar establishments versus the general population.

The appellate court must determine that the trial court did not err when there is no tangible evidence of proximate cause—cause-in-fact and foreseeability—between TriStar's actions and Miranda's injuries. Given that violent crimes at or near the store were not previously reported and that no other evidence suggested a likelihood of such an occurrence, the claim against TriStar for proximate cause is weak. With this deficiency in the evidence, it will be legally concluded that TriStar was not responsible for the robbery or Miranda's subsequent injuries. Miranda's inability to demonstrate that TriStar's alleged negligence was directly responsible for his predicament is central to the affirmation of the summary judgment. Therefore, the court will uphold the trial court's ruling and affirm the judgement in favor of TriStar."
"Nathaniel Cooper, who was diagnosed with a congenital heart block, underwent multiple heart surgeries, had four pacemakers, and suffered lasting heart damage from malfunctioning pacing wires. Employed by UPS as a supervisor, he worked in an un-air-conditioned warehouse in Houston and was placed on light duty due to his heart condition and a previous cardiac event. On June 3, 2005, Cooper collapsed at work, suffering a heart attack that led to his death. The medical examiner attributed his death to heart complications.

Terrica Barnes, Cooper's fiancée and the mother of his son Kainan, filed a workers' compensation claim under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act as next friend of the child. However, the claim was denied by the DWC hearing officer based on the finding that Cooper's work was not a substantial contributing factor to the cardiac arrest, instead attributing it to the natural progression of his preexisting heart condition. This decision was not appealed by Barnes and consequently became final.

Barnes then filed a wrongful death lawsuit against UPS alleging gross negligence, accusing UPS of failing to install proper ventilation and to shield employees from excessive heat. UPS moved for summary judgment, arguing the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel, suggesting Barnes's claim had already been litigated and resolved in the workers' compensation forum. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS.

Barnes appealed, disputing the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel. She contended that her right to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence, as a surviving heir, is constitutionally and statutorily protected, and that different factual and legal questions are pertinent to the gross negligence claim compared to the workers' compensation claim.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's summary judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings because the issues resolved in the prior workers' compensation claim are not identical to those presented in the gross negligence lawsuit. While both proceedings entail the same underlying facts, Barnes couldn't have raised the gross negligence claim before the DWC, which means the claim is not barred in the subsequent lawsuit.

Additionally, the causation burden under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 408.008 for the workers' compensation claim necessitates the demonstration that Cooper's work was the predominant factor contributing to his heart attack, as opposed to the natural progression of his preexisting heart condition. This is distinct from the causation burden in a gross negligence claim, where the plaintiff must establish that the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing injury but does not have to be the primary or sole factor.

Because establishing a claim under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 408.008 involves a unique and more stringent comparison or weighing of factors beyond what is required in a gross negligence case, the issue of causation was not fully and fairly litigated in the workers' compensation hearing in the context necessary for a gross negligence claim. Thus, Barnes is not barred by either res judicata or collateral estoppel from pursuing her gross negligence suit against UPS.

The appellate court will highlight these distinctions in causation standards and the inability to raise the gross negligence claim during the DWC proceedings to justify its reversal of the summary judgment. The court will likely affirm the right of an heir or surviving spouse to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence independently of the workers' compensation system, aligning with constitutional and statutory protections."
"On April 25, 1997, McWilliams was driving home with his wife, son, and son's friend after a basketball game during a harsh winter storm. While attempting to return to the right-hand lane after passing Masterson's truck, McWilliams' vehicle struck cattle on the highway. Masterson's truck then collided with the rear of McWilliams' vehicle, resulting in the death of McWilliams' wife and injuries to other occupants.

McWilliams sued Masterson and his employers for negligence, and the trial court provided jury instructions on the theories of sudden emergency, unavoidable accident, and act of God. McWilliams objected, arguing that the inclusion of unavoidable accident was no longer permissible, the evidence did not support its submission, and there was no proof to support an act of God instruction.

The trial unfolded with evidence presenting conflicting conditions regarding the snowstorm and road status. Testimony revealed that the cattle, belonging to the Gabels, had escaped from well-maintained confines by trampling a gate. The incident was attributed to instinctive cattle behavior during the storm. Witnesses indicated that reasonable cattle owners would not expect, nor could they prevent, cattle escaping under such conditions.

Several experts provided differing conclusions about the possibility of Masterson avoiding the collision with McWilliams' vehicle after it struck the cattle. Furthermore, evidence suggested that the unusual late-season winter storm contributed directly and exclusively to the accident without human intervention.","Considering the evidence presented, it's probable that the court will uphold the decision to instruct the jury on both unavoidable accident and act of God. The evidence reveals that the accident could have occurred despite all parties exercising proper care. For unavoidable accident, the icy conditions, speed regulations, cattle escaping due to the storm, and collective non-negligent behavior of McWilliams and Masterson justify the jury instruction.

As for the act of God, the evidence suggests that the late and intense winter storm led directly to the cattle's escape and subsequent presence on the highway, an uncommon event that could not have been reasonably foreseen or prevented. The court will likely find that, while human elements were present, their involvement did not constitute negligence directly contributing to the accident.

In conclusion, the court will probably argue that, since evidence supported the submission of each instruction, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court, nor was there an unwarranted comment on the weight of the evidence. Therefore, the court will likely affirm the trial court's judgment of no liability, maintaining that both the unavoidable accident and act of God theories were applicable and correctly presented to the jury based on the case's facts."
"Zachary Anam was detained by employees of Macy's department store for alleged shoplifting and arrested by Officer Iven Wall; he was handcuffed, placed in a patrol car, and had his seatbelt fastened. Officer Wall did not find the handgun Zachary had hidden on his person. During the drive to police headquarters, Zachary unbuckled his seatbelt, revealing the gun. Wall asked Zachary if he had anything else illegal, and informed him he would be searched at the jail which might lead to additional charges. Zachary disclosed he was feeling suicidal and had a loaded gun to his head. Wall stopped the car, exited, called for assistance, and warned others nearby. Minutes later, Zachary committed suicide by shooting himself.

The Anams sued the City of Austin under the Texas Tort Claims Act, contending Officer Wall's negligence in failing to refasten Zachary's seatbelt allowed him to access his gun and that the seatbelt's condition contributed to the death. They argued the Act waived the City's governmental immunity because the death arose from the use of a motor-driven vehicle or from a condition or use of tangible personal property.

The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting the claims do not fall under the Act's waivers of immunity. The trial court denied the City's plea. The City appealed, and the case was reconsidered en banc.","The court will reverse the trial court's decision and render judgment dismissing the Anams' claims against the City. The reasoning will hinge on the concept of proximate cause under the Tort Claims Act. The Anams will not have demonstrated the requisite foreseeability that failing to fasten a seatbelt in a police vehicle would lead to suicide by gunshot, nor that Wall's action in not refastening the seatbelt was a substantial factor in causing the injury that would not have occurred otherwise. Although seatbelt use is intended to prevent harm in the event of a collision or sudden stop, the appellate court will determine that the general danger of suicide in these circumstances should not have been foreseeable to an officer of ordinary intelligence.

The court will find that the Anams' claims do not address a wrongful act, omission, or condition or use of tangible property as defined under section 101.021 of the Act that proximately caused Zachary's death. Instead, the real substance of their claim will be seen to pertain to Wall's failure to detect and remove Zachary's gun before placing him in the patrol car, a scenario where the Act does not waive immunity.

Thus, the court will conclude that the claim cannot trigger the Act's narrow waiver of immunity, and the City's governmental immunity will remain intact. The appellate court's verdict will effectively hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Anams under the Texas Tort Claims Act."
"Appellants in this case are individuals and the personal representative of Jeronimo Carrasco's estate who initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Tri City Community Hospital (""Hospital"") following Carrasco's death. The lawsuit alleged that the Hospital failed to properly record Carrasco's complaints and did not report the results from his x-ray in a timely manner, which they claimed resulted in his death.

On April 20, 1995, Carrasco was taken to the Hospital's emergency room by ambulance, complaining of back pain. He was admitted, observed, but then released on April 21, still experiencing back pain. On April 22, he was unable to stand and complained of not having had a bowel movement for four days. An x-ray taken that day showed a significantly widened mediastinum and an increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette, prompting a recommendation to consider the possibility of an aortic dissection.

By April 24, Carrasco's condition had deteriorated, leading to his airlift to Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, where a CT scan revealed a type I dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Emergency surgery was performed to replace the ascending aorta with a synthetic graft. Despite the surgery, Carrasco developed a pericardial effusion with tamponade the next day, and after another round of emergency surgery, he passed away.

In response to the lawsuit, the Hospital moved for a no-evidence summary judgment, essentially arguing that there was no evidence to support the claim that the Hospital's actions were the proximate cause of Carrasco's death. The trial court granted the Hospital's motion, prompting the appeal.

The appeal court found that the Hospital was asserting that the appellants failed to present any evidence of proximate cause, which led to the initial summary judgment. Despite appellants' failure to file deposition testimony as per the rules, they attached two affidavits from Dr. Comer Roger Youmans, Jr., M.D., and the Hospital's medical records to their response, which the trial court could consider. Dr. Youmans stated that timely diagnosis and treatment of the dissecting aneurysm would have significantly improved Carrasco's chances of survival, arguing that the Hospital had a duty to convey the abnormal x-ray results to attending physicians urgently. The medical records and Dr. Youmans' affidavits were deemed sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause element of the case, which the trial court was accused of ignoring.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's ruling that granted the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of the Hospital. They will find that the affidavits from Dr. Youmans, coupled with the medical records, provide more than a scintilla of evidence, suggesting a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause element of the malpractice action. The affidavits assert a credible link between the alleged malpractice and the harm suffered, in that a timely intervention based on the x-ray results could have potentially led to a different outcome for Carrasco. It will be emphasized that failing to convey the results of the x-ray on the day of admission may have deprived Carrasco of the opportunity for elective surgery, which has statistically higher survival rates than emergency surgery following an aortic dissection rupture. Consequently, the appellate court will conclude that the Hospital's failure to ensure the x-ray results were reported to the attending physician on the day of admission may have been a proximate cause of Carrasco's subsequent injuries and untimely death. They will find that the trial court erred in granting the no-evidence summary judgment, and the case will be remanded for a trial where these issues can be fully explored before a jury."
"R.M.V., a 10-year-old child, was abducted on August 7, 1981, at around 7:00 p.m. from the sidewalk outside the Landmark Apartments where she resided. She was forcibly taken across the street to the Chalmette Apartments, which are diagonally situated, and raped in a vacant unit of this apartment complex. It was noted that the door of the vacant apartment was off its hinges, and the windows lacked panes, making the unit easily accessible and unsuitable for preventing unauthorized entry. The apartment complex's dilapidated state was a violation of the Dallas City Ordinance requiring doors and windows of vacant structures to be secured to prohibit unauthorized entry.

Gaile Nixon, mother and legal guardian of R.M.V., subsequently filed a lawsuit against multiple parties, including the owners and managers of both the Chalmette and Landmark Apartments. Nixon settled the case with the interests of Landmark Apartments and focused the lawsuit on the owner (Brett Davis) and manager (Mr. Property Management Company) of Chalmette Apartments, collectively referred to as Mr. Property. Nixon's action asserted that Mr. Property owed R.M.V. a duty of reasonable care, which was breached, and that this breach was a proximate cause of the rape. The traumatic event was characterized as reasonably foreseeable due to the history of prior violent activities, burglaries, and other crimes at the complex, as well as vagrants known to frequent the area.

The trial court ruled in favor of Mr. Property by granting a summary judgment, and the appeals court upheld this judgment. The plaintiff then brought the case to a higher court for review.","The higher court reversed the decisions of both the trial and appeals courts and remanded the cause for trial on the merits. The ruling is based on the existence of genuine issues of fact regarding Mr. Property's alleged breach of duty and whether their negligence proximately caused the child's injuries.

In determining Mr. Property's negligence per se, the court will consider whether the violation of the city ordinance, which was intended to deter criminal activity by eliminating obvious opportunities for criminal conduct, was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury (cause in fact). The evidence suggests that the assailant was aware of the vacant apartment and that he specifically chose it knowing it was an accessible location for the assault, implying it was not secured as required.

Moreover, in evaluating foreseeability, the court will consider that a reasonable person, in Mr. Property's position, should have anticipated the danger their negligent act created for others. Given the history of prior violent crimes at the Chalmette Apartments, additional violent acts would be considered reasonably foreseeable. Even the absence of evidence of prior rapes does not deter this finding as foreseeability does not require that the precise nature of the accident be predicted, but only that the general character of the accident could reasonably have been expected.

The evidence of the property's state and the significant record of crime, combined with testimony on the motivation behind securing vacant apartments, leads to the reasonable inference that improved security could have deterred R.M.V.'s assailant or others like him. The court recognizes that the presence of prior crimes similar in nature to the one endured by R.M.V. contributes to a foreseeability analysis, thereby creating a legitimate issue for a jury's consideration.

Therefore, the summary judgment was inappropriate given the unresolved material facts related to duty, breach, and proximate cause. The court remands the case to the trial court, stipulating that it should proceed to a trial on the merits where these issues can be fully examined."
"The background of the case involves a claim of negligence against Dr. Diego Rodriguez-Escobar by the respondent sons of Beverly Goss, who committed suicide. The sons claimed that the doctor negligently failed to involuntarily hospitalize their mother despite her history of suicidal behavior and clear risk of committing suicide. Goss's depressive state was born from her husband leaving her, and it had already resulted in a suicidal gesture—a shotgun discharge in her bedroom—leading to her initial hospitalization.

After the discharge incident, Beverly Goss voluntarily admitted herself to McAllen Medical Behavioral Health Center (MMBHC) and was treated for depression by Dr. Cesar Matos. While admitted, she expressed a desire to leave but withdrew her request after a discussion with Dr. Matos. Concerned for his mother's well-being and recognizing her suicidal risk, Goss's son Michael obtained an emergency detention warrant for involuntary admission to a state mental health facility.

Despite the warrant and the application filed by Michael, Dr. Matos discharged Goss to Tropical with the intent to transfer her to Rio Grande for continued treatment. Upon evaluation at Rio Grande, Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar examined Goss, reviewing her previous medical records, the emergency detention application, and the warrant. He also conducted an approximately 45-minute interview with Goss.

Following his evaluation, Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar determined that Goss did not meet the necessary criteria for involuntary hospitalization. He recommended outpatient treatment and released her on March 26, 2003. After her release, she visited her son Michael and appeared to be in an improved state. She attended a follow-up appointment with her family doctor and was evaluated by a social service worker who found her agreeable and not exhibiting signs of depression.

Communications with neighbors and her estranged husband about their ongoing separation and financial matters followed in the days after her release. Notably, Goss purchased a gun on the evening of March 29 and ultimately used it to commit suicide by a gunshot wound on March 30, 2003.

The Goss sons pursued a negligence case against Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar for failing to involuntarily commit her. The jury found against the doctor and awarded $200,000 in damages. The trial court upheld the verdict, and the Court of Appeals for the Thirteenth District of Texas affirmed the decision. Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar sought a review of the case by a higher court.","The verdict in favor of Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar is based on the prediction that the Supreme Court will agree that the evidence presented is legally insufficient to substantiate a causation link between the doctor's alleged negligence and Beverly Goss's suicide. Considering previous case law, the court will determine whether it was foreseeable and a cause-in-fact (but for the doctor's negligence, the suicide would not have occurred) that Goss would take her life after being released. 

In reaching the decision, the court will likley examine the specifics of the doctor's evaluation process, including the criteria he used to assess the necessity for involuntary hospitalization and his subsequent decision based on Goss's presentation during their interview. Despite the trial court's and Court of Appeals' affirmation of the jury's decision, the higher court will conclude that nothing in the expert testimony or presented evidence proves that the doctor's failure to hospitalize Goss caused her death in fact. 

Furthermore, the court will consider the predictability of suicide after voluntary discharge and the timeliness and disconnectedness of events from the moment of discharge to the act of suicide. This analysis will incorporate the testimony that Goss's depression was potentially treatable and would not have led to her suicide during the hypothetical period of hospitalization, as well as the fact that there was no certainty about the effect of hospitalization on her long-term prognosis.

Highlighting the lack of evidence indicating that hospitalization would have prevented Goss's suicide after release, the court will find that the doctor's decision not to involuntarily admit her was not a substantial factor in bringing about her death. In this anticipation of the high court's rationale, the decision will be to reverse the lower court's judgment and render judgment in favor of Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar."
"The respondent claimant, Lou Mae Wood, and her husband initiated a personal injury lawsuit due to injuries the respondent sustained in an escalator accident at the R. E. Cox department store in Waco, Texas. The elevator company, the store itself, and the general contractor for the store's building were named as defendants. The primary focus of the case was the determination of responsibility for the open space design beside the escalator’s handrail and whether a protective extension should have been installed.

During the incident, the respondent was caught and held in an unguarded space between the escalator’s side wall and the handrail. The design and negligence of the elevator company in not extending the top of the stationary guide of the handrail, and the handrail's friction pulling power when contacted by a person, were all in question.

Trial proceeded with a jury finding that the petitioner (Otis Elevator Company) was responsible for the design of the open space, that said design was negligence, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the respondent's injuries, including minor physical harm and a heart attack. The jury absolved the other defendants, Cox and Smith Building Company, from negligence. Both the trial court and the appellate court affirmed the judgment against Otis.

Key evidentiary points included expert testimony that the escalator could have been designed with a protective extension to prevent contact with the moving handrail, that the handrail could exert pulling force when contacted, and that other escalators had such protections in place. A hospital report was entered into evidence, documenting a medical opinion on the respondent's heart condition.","The court will affirm the appellate court's order and uphold the judgment of the trial court, finding evidence to support the jury's determination that the petitioner's negligent acts were proximate causes of the respondent’s accident. The court will hold Otis Elevator Company to a standard of reasonable care in the escalator's design, suggesting that the duty to protect against foreseeable risks is aligned with the product's intended use, which, in this case, includes the escalator's movement and vicinity.

The justification for the verdict will likely rest on the principle that even if the exact manner of the injury could not have been foreseen, a manufacturer should reasonably anticipate the general nature of potential injuries associated with the product's use. Therefore, it will be concluded that Otis had a duty to exercise reasonable care in designing the escalator to prevent such accidents, taking into account its intended use and surrounding environment.

On issues of medical evidence and causation regarding the respondent's heart attack, the court will likely determine them to be questions for the jury and will weigh the need for expert medical testimony to fall within the realm of reasonable medical certainty. However, they will also consider the substance rather than the semantics of such testimony. If the testimony implies a reasonable medical probability, even if not explicitly stated, it may be deemed admissible.

Finally, the court will address Otis's claim of indemnity from Cox, likely determining there is insufficient legal basis to conclude that Cox contractually failed to provide proper framed openings for the escalator, as there was a jury finding that the responsibility was Otis's. Therefore, the court will affirm that Otis is not entitled to indemnity from Cox, and the judgments against Otis will stand."
"Raquel Reyes Martinez, hereafter referred to as Martinez, sued the City of Brownsville following the suicide of her son, Roberto Martinez Reyes, referred to as Reyes, in the Brownsville City Jail. Reyes, who suffered from schizophrenia, was arrested for intoxication by paint and subsequently jailed. The jail staff knew Reyes and were aware of his suicide risk, as indicated by prior incarcerations and actions taken during those incarcerations. Despite this knowledge, Reyes was placed in a regular single cell rather than a padded cell, and he was not provided with tear-away paper garments designed for suicide risks. Instead, he retained his standard clothing. Reyes repeatedly asked for his psychiatric medication during his incarceration, displaying signs of being disturbed. His medication was delivered to the jail by his case manager, Ricardo Vargas, who emphasized the importance of administering it. However, the jail staff did not give Reyes the medication. Later, Reyes hung himself with his shirt using the bars of his cell door. Although the cells were under surveillance by camera, his act of suicide was not observed by the jail staff, with differing testimonies regarding the coverage and focus of the cameras.

Both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment motions were filed by the city, claiming sovereign immunity. The 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas, granted the summary judgment in favor of the city without specifying the basis of its decision, leading Martinez to appeal. She argued that the city waived its immunity because her son’s death was caused by a condition or use of tangible property owned by the city. The City of Brownsville rebutted that Reyes's negligent use of the cell door, not a government employee's, could not lead to the waiver of sovereign immunity.","Considering the case, the appeals court will likely reverse the lower court's summary judgment ruling in favor of the City of Brownsville. The court will adjudicate that the City of Brownsville did not establish the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity as a matter of law. The ruling will be based on the facts that the jail staff failed to take adequate precautions to prevent Reyes, a known suicide risk, from harming himself, despite several means and regulations to prevent such an incident. The court will distinguish between the negligent formulation of policy (which retains sovereign immunity) and the negligent implementation of policy (which does not), finding substantial evidence that the city staff negligently implemented existing policies regarding inmate surveillance, issuance of safe clothing, and administration of medication.

The city’s use of tangible property (the cell and Reyes’s clothing) without necessary safety components (tear-away paper garments and medication administration procedures), coupled with their knowledge of Reyes’s suicidal risk and failure to follow established procedures, will be deemed a proximate cause of Reyes’s death. The court will likely emphasize that the jail provided Reyes with a condition to facilitate his suicide by placing him in a cell with bars accessible with his regular clothing, contrary to their own policies for managing suicide-risk inmates. 

The appeals court will remand the case for further proceedings, determining that the city failed to conclusively prove that Martinez's claims were barred by sovereign immunity, statute of limitations, lack of evidence of waiver of sovereign immunity, or affirmative defense under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section 93.001. Thus, the lawsuit will proceed to the trial stage for further developments."
"Scott, a 46-year-old optometrist, suffered from ventricular tachycardia, or rapid heartbeat. His doctor prescribed Tambocor for this condition in 1998. On January 19, 2000, when his heartbeat did not return to normal after taking Tambocor, Scott was taken to Las Colinas Medical Center's emergency room. Nurse Crain, an emergency room nurse at the Medical Center, took Scott's initial information, and emergency room personnel confirmed via EKG that he was experiencing ventricular tachycardia.

Scott informed Nurse Crain that he had taken Tambocor for his rapid heartbeat, but it was not effective. He also expressed a desire to avoid cardioversion (""shocking""). Scott was conscious, stable, and in no pain. Dr. Kimberly Zeh ordered treatments for Scott, which did not stabilize his heartbeat. She consulted with Dr. John Osborne, the on-call cardiologist, and subsequently ordered administration of 5 milligrams of Verapamil, a drug contraindicated for ventricular tachycardia. Paramedic Johansen administered the Verapamil, causing Scott to suffer a severe drop in blood pressure, a convulsion, and cardiac arrest, leading to anoxic brain injury.

At trial, Nurse Crain testified, acknowledging awareness of the drug's contraindications and potential risks, which included death. Despite serious concerns about Verapamil's appropriateness, Nurse Crain did not intervene. Nurse Heskes, House Supervisor and top/head nurse that night, was also aware of Verapamil's contraindications and had serious questions yet failed to intervene.

The Medical Center had no job description for emergency room paramedics like Johansen; a policy titled ""Procedures Performed by Non-Physicians"" prohibited paramedics from administering cardiac medications.

The ACLS manual warns against administering Verapamil to patients with ventricular tachycardia, highlighting the potential for rapid deterioration. Despite Nurse Crain, Johansen, and Nurse Heskes acknowledging awareness of these warnings and having serious questions about the drug, they did not act on them. Dr. Zeh had ordered Verapamil following a conversation with Dr. Osborne and thought it was recommended.

Dr. Osborne testified he did not order Verapamil; he only mentioned some ventricular tachycardias in young people may be classified as Verapamil-sensitive. He returned to the hospital after learning Scott remained stable but found upon arrival that Scott had already been administered Verapamil resulting in his severe anoxic encephalopathy, a consequence of the drug's effects.

Expert witnesses testified on both sides, with varying opinions on the appropriateness of Verapamil for Scott's condition; however, the preponderance of evidence pointed to it being contraindicated. Scott's life expectancy and future medical expenses were also discussed, with projections made for ongoing care needs.","The evidence for negligence and malice was legally and factually sufficient, showing the drug's administration involved an extreme risk of harm, and key medical staff were aware of the risk yet went ahead with administration. The jury could reasonably infer that the Verapamil administration proximately caused Scott's injury, as he was stable before its administration, and it was known to be contraindicated. The jury's decision to attribute malice to the Medical Center was supported by evidence that a vice principal of the hospital recognized the risk and ratified the conduct by failing to intervene.

The monetary damages awarded to Scott for future medical expenses were within the jury's discretion, given his injuries and care requirements, without the necessity for expert testimony to establish precise future costs. The updated pre and postjudgment interest rates asserted by the appellants were not applicable to this case because they are effective prospectively and not on judgments already signed or subject to appeal prior to the amendment date. As such, the offsets were not applicable, and the judgment was affirmed as proper based on the evidence presented."
"The plaintiff, who held a grazing lease on one hundred acres of land owned by a Mrs. Carson, encountered a tragic loss on April 27 when six of his cows were found dead. They lay in a row over a sizzling wire that had fallen between two poles owned by the defendant, Shell Oil Company. One of these poles was situated near Carson No. 2, one of two oil wells owned by the defendant on the same land. While Carson No. 1 was still in production as of April 1963, Carson No. 2 had not been in operation. The jury found that the defendant's act of leaving the power line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well's disconnection amounted to negligence and was the proximate cause of the cattle’s deaths.

An account by the defendant’s Production Foreman for Archer County outlined the history of Carson No. 2: It was originally electrically operated from December 1951 until 1955 when a gas engine replaced the electricity. The original power lines remained despite the switch. Electric power was reintroduced in March 1959 once it became purchasable. The well was temporarily abandoned in December 1961, and although not plugged, it was officially abandoned with the Railroad Commission's approval on January 8, 1962. The casing remained in the well and electrical power was disconnected in a manner deemed safe and customary for temporary disconnections at a pumping unit installation.

There was consensus that a lightning bolt striking a phase of the power line during the night of April 26—which had a thunderstorm with lightning—caused the wire to burn, break loose, and fall. There was no evidence suggesting that lightning is more likely to strike a charged wire compared to a ""cold"" or inactive one. Additionally, there were no presented allegations of defective equipment, failure to conduct proper inspections, or violation of regulatory statutes by the defendant.

The plaintiff referred to Texas Power & Light Co. v. Culwell as a case precedent. However, that precedent stressed the feasibility and practicability of insulating wire to prevent the escape of electric current in case of contact with another object. This case, contrastingly, lacked evidence indicating that the defendant's actions or inactions constituted negligence. Moreover, no testimony contested the defense's claim that the power was disconnected in a secure and accepted fashion. Based on the lack of evidence pointing to any increased hazard following the cessation of activities at the well, a duty to act differently by the defendant was not established.","The verdict was that the plaintiff's loss of cattle could not be legally attributed to the defendant's negligence. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff from the trial court was overturned, and a new judgment was rendered for the defendant. This conclusion is reached because there was inadequate proof that the defendant's conduct—leaving the line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well was abandoned—created a hazard significantly greater than before the well's production ceased.

Furthermore, it was found that the defendant's method of disconnecting the electrical power, considered safe and industry standard, was not challenged by any credible evidence that suggested an alternative practice should have been employed. Since the occurrence of lightning striking the wire was unforeseeable, and in the absence of proof that a charged wire posed a greater risk than an inactive one, there was no basis for a foreseeable risk that could have been averted by the defendant.

The court aligned with previous cases determining that without evidence demonstrating an increased danger due to the charged wire, no duty or negligence can be established, and the occurrence of an accident alone does not constitute liability if the consequences were not reasonably foreseeable. As a result, the defendant was found not liable as there was no established negligence or proximate cause linking their action or inaction to the tragic incident involving the plaintiff’s cattle."
"Thad Manchac, a 44-year-old with a bioprosthetic aortic valve, developed pneumonia and was hospitalized at Memorial Hermann - The Woodlands. After being discharged, he continued to experience health issues, including epigastric fullness and pressure in his abdomen. He was referred to a cardiologist, Dr. Brenda Peabody, to address the discomfort. An echocardiogram indicated severe issues with his aortic valve and a diagnosis of ""1) prosthetic aortic valve regurgitation and 2) endocarditis of prosthetic valve."" Dr. Peabody noted that Mr. Manchac required immediate aortic valve replacement and a consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon was needed. Despite this, Mr. Manchac was discharged after the outpatient procedure. 

Three days later, Mr. Manchac saw Dr. Charles Sims, an infectious disease doctor, upon Dr. Peabody's referral. Dr. Sims recommended valve replacement surgery, post-antibiotics period. Blood cultures were taken, but no immediate action or hospital admission was recommended. 

Mr. Manchac then suddenly passed away due to complications from aortic valve disease. An autopsy indicated a calcified thrombus obstructing Mr. Manchac's prosthetic aortic valve. The Manchac family filed a medical malpractice suit against St. Luke's Lakeside Hospital, Dr. Peabody, Dr. Sims, and Greater Houston Physician's Medical Association, alleging negligence in the treatment provided and the failure to prevent Mr. Manchac's early discharge from the hospital. They served expert reports criticizing the care provided, but each appellant (the defendants) contested the sufficiency of these reports and moved for dismissal, which the trial court denied.

The appellants appealed the denial of their motions to dismiss, arguing that the expert reports were insufficient and did not meet the requirements of the Texas Medical Liability Act - specifically, that the reports were conclusory, did not establish the required standards of care, and failed to demonstrate causation adequately.","The court considers each appellant's claim in turn, assessing whether the expert reports provide a sufficient connection between the alleged breaches of standard care by each medical provider and Mr. Manchac's death.

For St. Luke's appeal, the court concludes that expert reports from Nurse Kimberly Roberts and Dr. Paul S. Brown, when read together, link the nurses' alleged breach of standard care to Mr. Manchac's death. Specifically, Roberts' views on a nurse's responsibility to ensure patient understanding and coordination of care, and Dr. Brown’s views on causation establish the necessary connection. 

Regarding Dr. Peabody, the court finds Dr. Julie Anne Kovach's and Dr. Brown's expert reports sufficient. Both reports assert that immediate hospital admission was required after the TEE procedure, and had that occurred, the necessary surgery would very likely have been performed within 72 hours—potentially saving Mr. Manchac's life.

For Dr. Sims and Greater Houston Physician's Medical Association, the court again finds the reports of Dr. Stephen K. Felts and Dr. Brown adequate, as they lay out the expected course of action after the TEE results and the consequences of failing to admit Mr. Manchac for immediate surgical consultation.

The court will ultimately affirm the judgment, ruling that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions to dismiss. The expert reports are considered to represent a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the Act, providing a fair summary of how the medical providers allegedly breached their respective standards of care and how that breach was causally linked to Mr. Manchac's death. The reasoning accounts for the appellants' ability and authority to intervene and prevent the discharge or initiate further medical action. The reports do not merely speculate but draw from the experts' knowledge, experience, and the established standards of care within their respective fields. Thus, the verdict affirms that the claims against the appellants have sufficient merit to proceed, and the dismissal of the suit is not warranted at this stage of the litigation."
"This case revolves around a multi-vehicle accident that happened on U.S. Highway 67 near Texarkana. Mrs. Addie Campbell, driving her pickup truck, attempted to cross the highway into the westbound lane when her pickup truck was struck in the rear by an automobile driven by Thomas J. Marshall. The collision occurred at night under rainy conditions. As a result of the impact, Marshall's trailer became disengaged and overturned in the north traffic lane. Mrs. Campbell's vehicle was knocked off the roadway, as was Marshall's, but the trailer posed a danger on the highway.

William Payton Jr., John Homer Bell, and Frank T. Bransford stopped to help remove the trailer from the road. During their attempt, they were struck by a third vehicle driven by W. W. Fore, resulting in the death of Payton and Bell and injuries to Bransford. Fore had either ignored or did not see the signals given by another person to alert oncoming traffic of the hazard. Fore, who was later discovered to be driving and had been drinking, initially falsely claimed his wife was driving.

The petitioners, the statutory beneficiaries of Payton and Bell, and the injured Bransford, filed suit against the two initial motorists (Marshall and Mrs. Campbell) and Mr. and Mrs. Fore. After settling with the Fores, they proceeded against Marshall and Mrs. Campbell, who also filed for indemnity and contribution from the Fores.

The court's task was to assess causation. Respondents (Marshall and Mrs. Campbell) were acquitted by the jury of any negligence that could be a proximate cause of the second collision, with the findings attributing proximate causation to the negligence of Mr. Fore. The court faced the question of whether respondents' potential negligence could have foreseen the resulting injuries from the secondary accident, an issue of proximate cause and the foreseeability of an independent intervening cause.","The court will affirm the judgment in favor of the respondent motorists from the trial and appellate court, holding that their conduct, even if negligent, was not the proximate cause of the injuries sustained in the second accident. The reasoning will hinge upon the legal principle that for an act to be the proximate cause of an injury, it must have been foreseeable that the act could lead to the injury, implying that the injury should be a natural and probable result of the act. Since the actions of Marshall and Mrs. Campbell were deemed complete, having ceased exerting influence, their inadvertent creation of the initial condition did not actively contribute to the injuries sustained from the second collision. Instead, Fore's intervention was independent, new, and unforeseeable, breaking the chain of causation from the first accident.

The court will elaborate that the negligence of the respondents did not concur with Fore's actions to cause the injuries, as it was too remote and not the immediate cause. Respondents could not have reasonably anticipated that their actions could lead to the serious injury or deaths of individuals unrelated to the original incident. Fore's actions will be viewed as the new, independent, and intervening cause that served as the active and immediate cause of the injuries.

The jury's earlier findings will be pivotal in supporting the court's decision. The jury's refusal to find Marshall negligent in various respects, its attribution of proximate cause for the first collision to Mrs. Campbell's negligence, and clear findings that Fore's conduct in the second collision constituted a new and independent cause, will guide the court's analysis. As such, respondents will be relieved from liability for the injuries sustained by Payton, Bell, and Bransford in the secondary collision based on the principles of proximate cause and foreseeability within Texas law."
"J. P. Nenney, Jr., a flagman employed by the appellant company, Texas Traction Company, suffered injuries in December of 1912 due to an accident involving an express car. The incident occurred while Nenney was working on a gravel train, fulfilling his duties to navigate a switch at Kirkland’s Switch to allow the passing of other trains. Due to what the widow and minor child of Nenney allege were the negligence of the company’s employees in charge of the express car, Nenney had to jump from a motor car to avoid a collision, resulting in injuries. The company’s employees allegedly operated the express car at a high and excessive rate of speed, failed to control the car when approaching a switch, and failed to keep a proper lookout. Nenney, who was injured about his hips and stomach, became bedridden for several weeks but managed to partially recover, using support tools like a stick and crutches. However, in February following his accident, Nenney contracted grippe (influenza), and later tuberculosis, leading to his death. 

An ""Amended Plea in Intervention"" was filed by Nenney's widow and parents on behalf of herself and their minor child. It was claimed Nenney's injuries not only caused physical and mental pain and incurred medical expenses, but also weakened his resistance to disease, leading to his death from tuberculosis. The company argued the collision was a result of Nenney's failure to perform his duties, negating its liability, and sought a peremptory instruction for a judgment in its favor. Among other evidence, Nenney's pre-death deposition and the testimonies of physicians were presented, wherein it was ascertained that Nenney had mostly recovered from the accident's injuries before contracting grippe and tuberculosis. The jury found in favor of the appellees, the widow and child, awarding them damages for Nenney's death, which they determined to be the proximate cause of the accident. The company’s request for a peremptory instruction was denied by the lower court, resulting in the current appeal.","Given the evidence, it is likely the court will reverse the lower court judgment and remand the cause for a new trial. Even if Nenney was negligent, it will be argued that the company's employees also had the last clear chance to avoid the accident but failed to do so. However, the key issue will be the proximate cause of Nenney's death. Despite the argument that the injuries weakened Nenney's system, rendering him more susceptible to disease, the court will likely find that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the accident injuries were the proximate cause of Nenney's death from tuberculosis.

Physician testimony suggested that Nenney had largely recovered from his injuries when he later contracted grippe, an illness common during the time, and subsequently tuberculosis. According to medical opinions, though the injuries might have reduced Nenney's ability to resist disease, this debilitated condition was not shown to have led directly to the bacterial infection. Instead, it was a subsequent, separate ailment—grippe—followed by the contraction of tuberculosis that proximately caused his death. While the physical injuries were severe and resulted in suffering, they were not shown to be the direct cause of the infection. 

Therefore, in anticipation of the decision, the court will likely note that a proximate cause of death must be a consequence that a reasonably prudent person would foresee as a result of the conduct in question. Given the lack of clear evidence tying the accident directly to the death and the possibility of other intervening causes such as grippe, the court will likely determine that the injuries were not the natural and probable cause. However, it will likely not warrant a peremptory instruction and a direct ruling in favor of the company since the appeal is based on the rejection of such an instruction and other grounds for recovery may still be legitimate. Instead, the case will be sent back for reconsideration and a new trial, focusing on the correct grounds for determination of damages."
"Appellee Richard E. Franklin and his wife, Doris, brought suit against appellant National Life and Accident Insurance Company to recover accidental death benefits under two insurance policies issued on the life of Doris Franklin’s son, Larry W. Fife. The policies, one from 1962 and one from 1966, provided death benefits and additional accidental death benefits. Basic benefits had been paid, and the dispute concerned only the accidental death benefits. The appellees also sought a statutory penalty and attorney's fees under Texas law. The insured, Fife, was found dead in his apartment, lying over the edge of the bathtub with little water since the drain was open. The autopsy showed drowning as the cause of death but indicated that a seizure might have occurred at or near the time of death, evidenced by a bitten tongue, distended neck veins, and a contorted head position.

The policies defined coverage for accidents occurring directly and independently of all other causes, effected solely through external, violent, and accidental means, excluding deaths contributed to by any disease or mental infirmity. The jury determined that Fife's death resulted directly and independently from an accident and not from disease or mental infirmity. The appellant challenged the verdict, arguing insufficient evidence to support that the insured died solely by accidental means and that the death was not contributed to by the insured's known mild epileptic condition.","The verdict to award accidental death benefits to appellee Doris Franklin will be based on the jury's findings that align with the relevant policy definitions and legal precedents. The court will affirm that epilepsy might have caused Fife to fall but did not cause the death by drowning, making the epileptic seizure at most a remote cause in the chain of events leading to death. This reasoning follows Texas Supreme Court decisions that preexisting conditions do not bar recovery if they are too remote to have materially contributed to death. Given that drowning was the immediate cause of death, and assuming epilepsy did cause the fall, epilepsy will be considered a remote cause, not affecting the accidental nature of the death in legal terms.

The court will likely reject the appellant's contention that Fife's death was contributed to by a disease, as the policy language necessitates a proximate cause, not simply a contributing or remote factor. The phrase ""contributed to"" in the policy will not extend liability to remote causes in the causal chain. The court will probably follow the reasoning that the disease need only be a proximate, not the sole, cause to satisfy the exclusion, which is not the case here. As the jury found that the insured's death was caused solely by accidental means, and because the evidence did not compel that epilepsy was more than a remote cause in Fife's death, the jury's verdict will be sustained, and the appellant's challenges will be overruled. The judgment from the trial court in favor of appellees will be affirmed."
"Daniella Bustamante was born prematurely at Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso on May 19, 2005. She suffered from several medical problems related to her premature birth and was admitted to Del Sol's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where she was under the care of Dr. Enrique N. Ponte Jr., a neuroneonatologist, and Dr. Jorge Fabio Llamas-Soforo, an ophthalmologist. Ponte, who was concerned about Daniella developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), contacted Llamas for examination. Llamas examined Daniella on July 4, 2005, and saw no signs of ROP; he recommended a follow-up in four weeks. On August 1, Daniella was found to have developed ROP, and surgery was performed on August 4. Despite this, Daniella's right retina became detached, leading to blindness in the right eye and significant impairment in her left eye.

Appellees, acting as next friends of Daniella, sued Ponte, Llamas, and their employers for medical malpractice, alleging negligence that caused Daniella's vision impairment. They claimed the four-week delay between ROP examinations and a three-day delay in surgical treatment post-diagnosis, as well as an inadequately performed laser surgery, violated the standard of care and proximately caused Daniella’s injuries. Appellees relied on the expert testimony of Dr. William Good, a pediatric ophthalmologist, and Dr. Dale Phelps, a neonatologist. The jury found Ponte, Llamas, and the Del Sol Medical Center negligent. Dr. Good and Dr. Phelps testified that the injuries were preventable and that earlier treatment would have likely resulted in a sighted life for Daniella.","The verdict in the case was reversed with the court rendering judgment that the appellees take nothing. In predicting the reasoning for this verdict, the key focus of the appellate court was the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding proximate cause. Specifically, the court analyzed the cause in fact, which requires proof that the negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries and that the harm would not have occurred but for the negligent act. The expert testimony was found to be legally insufficient to support a causation finding; it was deemed too conclusory and speculative as it did not establish but-for causation backed by a sufficient factual basis.

The court found that the testimony from the appellees’ experts did not establish that the delay in examinations and the manner of the surgery were more likely than not the but-for cause of Daniella’s injuries. The testimony that earlier examinations would have provided an opportunity for treatment that ""would have improved the chance of a good visual outcome"" and that the delay in surgery ""incrementally increased the chances of a bad outcome,"" was insufficient for establishing but-for causation. The court required the plaintiff's experts to provide a basis for their opinions that linked the defendants’ specific acts of negligence to the injuries sustained, rather than general assertions or statistical probabilities.

Additionally, the court considered the ETROP study results, which showed that early treatment for ROP led to better outcomes, but did not provide specific evidence that earlier treatment would have prevented Daniella's particular injuries. The study’s statistical probability was not by itself considered legally sufficient to establish causation without a factual demonstration that Daniella's case was substantially similar to those in the study. The court concluded that the expert testimony lacked a factual foundation, and as such, their causation opinions were conclusory and could not be considered probative evidence of causation.

In summary, the court rejected the notion that the appellees had proven that it was more likely than not that the negligence by Ponte and Llamas proximately caused Daniella's vision loss. The court called for more specific evidence directly connecting the negligent acts to the injuries rather than reliance on statistical probabilities or the assertion that the negligence contributed in some way to the injuries. Thus, due to the lack of non-conclusory, legally sufficient evidence of causation, the court decided in favor of the appellants, reversing the judgment of the trial court."
"Appellants Earreserryil and Annamma Berly, individually and as representatives of the estate of Anecletas Berly, along with Transportation Insurance Company (as intervenor), challenged a take-nothing summary judgment from the 14th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas, in favor of appellees, D&L Security Services and Investigations, Inc. and Elbert Phillips, a security guard employed by D&L. Anecletas Berly, an employee at a Kroger store, was fatally shot by a shoplifter while at work. D&L Security Services provided security for the store, and on the day of the incident, Phillips was observing from an upstairs observation room and intervened upon seeing the shoplifter stealing batteries. A scuffle ensued when Phillips attempted to handcuff the shoplifter, who then pulled out a gun and shot Phillips in the eye, and subsequently shot and killed Berly as he tried to flee.

Appellants alleged that D&L and Phillips were negligent in providing security, claiming they failed to properly investigate criminal activity in the area, failed to provide adequate security, failed to properly hire and train guards, and used improper procedures in apprehending the shoplifter. Appellees moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Berly's death was not proximately caused by their actions, their actions were legally privileged under Texas law, and they had no duty, as a matter of law, to protect against the criminal acts of a third person. The trial court permitted Transportation Insurance Company to intervene but eventually granted a partial summary judgment and a final judgment against all appellants, stating that appellees owed no duty to protect against the criminal acts of third parties.","The court predicted that the judgment would be reversed and the case remanded. The appellees were not entitled to summary judgment because the criminal acts that led to the appellant's death were foreseeable, and his death was the proximate result of appellees' negligence in their security measures. The security guard's actions in failing to follow proper procedures, as detailed by industry standards and the policy manuals of Kroger and D&L, collectively contributed to the incident leading to Berly's death. Specifically, the guard violated policy by not patrolling visibly, stopping the shoplifter inside rather than outside the store without another employee, using physical force despite policies prohibiting such conduct, searching the shoplifter without involving police, and improperly searching and attempting to handcuff the shoplifter. The guard's actions were not conducted in a controlled or pro-active manner, which, according to expert testimony, could have prevented the crime.

Moreover, the guard’s failure to follow recognized procedures created a dangerous situation that could have been anticipated, given the general character and prior history of violent crimes in the store's vicinity. Those past instances should have made the risk of violent crime foreseeable, and a reasonable person could have anticipated the dangers created by the negligent conduct. Considering the appellants' evidence of prior criminal activity, including incidents at the store involving force and violence, the court was expected to opine that this created a genuine issue of material fact regarding the foreseeability and reasonableness of appellees' actions in terms of duty and proximate cause.

Additionally, the court would likely predict that any claim of privilege under Texas law or policy, allowing the defense of one’s property or the detention of shoplifters, would not grant immunity since it is not reasonable to cause risk or harm to third parties, and the reasonableness must be assessed by a jury.

Thus, the detailed evidence presented by appellants revealed material factual disputes that precluded summary judgment, as a reasonable person could conclude that appellees' security measures were inadequate and foreseeably led to Berly's death. The court would likely require that these disputed facts be resolved at a full trial on the merits."
"The insured, Thomas H. Dixon, while engaged in gardening activities on his property, encountered a weed difficult to pull from the ground. Upon exerting a strong pull, the weed gave way, causing Dixon to fall backward and strike the ground with considerable force on his right side, injuring his head, side, and leg. Shortly after the incident, Dixon experienced complete paralysis on the right side of his body. At the trial, Dixon's physician testified that such a fall and impact could cause the rupture of a blood vessel, which in Dixon's case led to paralysis due to this rupture impacting his brain. The physician also testified that if the rupture had occurred before the fall, Dixon would not have been able to walk into his house as he did. Prior to this event, Dixon claimed to have been in perfect health, with no symptoms indicative of an imminent rupture.

The insurer contended that Dixon’s paralysis was not caused exclusively by an accidental fall but was due to a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure, which could have contributed to the rupture of the artery. The trial court jury found that Dixon’s fall was accidental and was the direct and proximate cause of his paralysis. The insurer appealed, disputing the trial court's judgment and maintaining that the findings were contrary to the evidence.","The appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The reason is that the evidence demonstrated that the rupture of the artery, leading to Dixon's paralysis, was directly and proximately caused by the fall. It is likely that the court will reason that while the insurer raised the possibility of Dixon's high blood pressure being a contributing factor, there was no direct evidence of such a medical condition at the time of the accident. The physicians’ opinions pointed out the potential for pre-existing high blood pressure without firm evidence that it existed in a severe form before the accident.

The court will find that the matter of causation was appropriately left to the jury, which concluded that the accidental fall was the emanative cause of the injury Dixon suffered. It will be determined that even if Dixon had some pre-existing susceptibility due to blood pressure, it does not negate the liability for the accident since the rupture and subsequent paralysis were the immediate results of the fall.

Furthermore, the court will address the insurer's argument regarding the conditions of the policy. The appellate court will clarify that the policy covers injuries that occur through purely accidental means even if they aggravate or accelerate a pre-existing condition, provided the accidental means were the sole cause at the time of occurrence. The requested instructions by the insurer that were refused by the trial court will be deemed unnecessary, as the jury was adequately and correctly guided to decide whether the fall was accidental and directly caused the paralysis, exclusive of any other conditions.

Overall, the appellate court will reject the insurer's contention that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and affirm the trial court's findings in favor of the insured, Dixon."
"James Watson was hospitalized at North Hills Hospital on February 23, 1995, for hip surgery, but his health deteriorated leading to further treatments at various facilities, including Transitional Hospital Corporation (THC) and Westpark Nursing Home. Six months later, in August 1995, he was admitted to Watson Memorial Nursing Home. By September 24, 1995, he had to be transported to Harris Methodist Hospital, where doctors observed his dire physical condition. The hospital suspected the neglect and abuse were due to the nursing home, triggering an investigation by the Texas Department of Human Services (TDHS). Watson died on October 2, 1995. 

Surviving children Donna Pack, Ann Bowling, and Linda Pearson filed a lawsuit against Crossroads Evangelism, Inc. d/b/a Watson Memorial Nursing Home and individual staff members, alleging negligence, negligence per se, gross negligence, wrongful death, and other claims, seeking damages under the Texas Survival Statute and the Wrongful Death Act. The jury returned a ""take nothing"" judgment in favor of Watson Memorial.

Appellants contested various trial court decisions on admissibility of evidence, discovery, expert testimony, and the striking of negligence per se claims. They argued for inclusion of TDHS records beyond those pertaining to Watson to show a pattern of neglect and contested the exclusion of Harris Methodist Hospital records and testimony from Dr. James Cox that might have implied Watson's condition resulted from neglect. They disagreed with the trial court’s refusal to release TDHS photographs of Watson and limitation of nurse Dolores Alford’s expert testimony. Appellants asserted the trial court erred in striking their negligence per se claims and contended that the evidence was factually insufficient to support a verdict for the defense. They also challenged the jury question formulation, which they believed should have included a question on Watson Memorial’s negligence leading to injuries not causing death, relevant to their survival claim.","The trial court's judgment was upheld. The appellate court reasoned that the limitation of TDHS records to those concerning Watson was within the court's discretion as other records did not constitute expert testimony and might have been overly prejudicial. Restrictions on the admissibility of Harris Methodist Hospital records and Dr. James Cox's testimony were deemed non-arbitrary as his conclusions on abuse or neglect were speculative, lacking a basis in fact specific to Watson's experience at the nursing home. The TDHS photographs were considered confidential and not subject to disclosure based on rulings that ""reports, records, and working papers,"" including photographs taken during investigations, were protected from public disclosure. Dolores Alford's qualifications were deemed insufficient to be considered an expert on standards of care, thus her testimony was limited. Negligence per se claims were correctly struck as the cited MLIIA and administrative code did not provide for tort liability in medical malpractice lawsuits. The jury's take nothing verdict was supported by evidence and not manifestly unjust. The trial court did not err in its jury question about negligence leading to death, as the wrongful death and survival actions arose from the same allegations and the evidence of causation was insufficient to support a verdict in favor of the appellants on the survival claim. Moreover, the appellate court presumed in favor of broad-form submission of questions, seeing no reverse error in light thereof, and the totality of circumstances surrounding the charge itself. The appellants' issues were overruled in their entirety, and the take nothing judgment against them was affirmed."
"Vertex Services, LLC (Vertex), a company supplying offshore labor and staffing, engaged in a legal dispute with Oceanwide Houston, Inc., Oceanwide Texas, Inc., and Oceanwide America, Inc. (collectively, Oceanwide). Vertex accused Oceanwide of ""poaching"" its foreign workers that were intended for a contract with an oil and gas company, TETRA Applied Technologies, LLC (TETRA), thus forcing Vertex out of business dealings with TETRA. Vertex's claims arose from several events:

- Vertex had a contract with TETRA to supply contract labor until December 31, 2015.
- To fulfill its obligations to TETRA, Vertex engaged Sea Cross Marine PTE (Sea Cross) through a contract initiated on June 20, 2010, which technically expired on October 9, 2010, but their business relationship continued past this end date.
- TETRA informed Vertex it would not extend their contract beyond the initial term due to a need for reduced labor costs.
- Meanwhile, Vertex and TETRA had discussions about reduced rates for labor in the following year.
- On December 15, 2015, Jimmy Ho of Sea Cross expressed preference to continue working through Vertex.
- By ""February 2016,"" Sea Cross ended its contract with Vertex.
- Oceanwide began negotiations to supply labor to TETRA in February 2016.
- Communications between John Ford of Oceanwide and Ho suggested Oceanwide's intention to partner with Sea Cross for TETRA's labor needs.
- On February 8, emails between Ho and James Ireland of Oceanwide discussed the provision of former Sea Cross laborers to TETRA through Oceanwide.
- On March 4, 2016, TETRA and Oceanwide signed a labor-supply contract that required Oceanwide to provide the same foreign labor that Sea Cross had provided through Vertex in 2015.
- Vertex filed suit against Oceanwide, claiming (1) tortious interference with the Vertex-Sea Cross contract, (2) tortious interference with a prospective business relationship with Sea Cross, (3) misappropriation of Vertex's knowledge and trained employees, and (4) conspiracy to interfere with the Vertex-Sea Cross contract.
- Oceanwide filed a no-evidence and traditional summary judgment motion on all of Vertex's claims, which the trial court granted.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, locating several issues with Vertex's claims. Regarding misappropriation, the court will state that the knowledge, training, and expertise of human labor are distinct from saleable work products and cannot be considered products capable of misappropriation. Conversion of intangibles like Vertex's ""knowledge of the industry, business practices, and trained employees"" does not fulfill the criteria of a protectable product, as established by existing case law which typically requires a product to be distinct and saleable in nature.

As for tortious interference with contract, the court, after confirming that Oceanwide's motion initially failed to properly address the Vertex-Sea Cross contract, will find that the summary judgment relating to this claim was put before the court by Vertex's response and Oceanwide's reply, which were fully argued and addressed. Nevertheless, the court will determine there is no evidence that the Vertex-Sea Cross contract was still effective when Oceanwide allegedly interfered with it. Additionally, there is no evidence that Oceanwide knew of the contract's status or intentionally acted to cause its breach.

The claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations will not be effectively disputed by Vertex, leading the court to also affirm the judgment on this claim; Vertex only challenges the Oceanwide-TETRA dynamic, not the claim related to prospective relations with Sea Cross as asserted in its underlying petition and addressed in the trial court's judgment.

Finally, regarding the civil conspiracy claim, the court will underscore that this claim is dependent on the existence of an underlying tort. Since the tortious interference claim does not survive, the court will conclude that the civil conspiracy claim based on this tort also fails.

In sum, the court will sustain Oceanwide's no-evidence summary judgment on all claims due to Vertex's inability to demonstrate the existence of key elements within its claims, reinforcing that Vertex has not presented sufficient evidence to justify its allegations or overcome the summary judgment."
"Twenty-one-year-old Lance Dowell had a previous history of mental health issues, including a prior suicide attempt when he was 19, which led to a voluntary hospitalization and treatment at DePaul Center, a psychiatric treatment division of respondent Providence Health Care. In the days leading up to the incident in question, Lance was in a distraught state due to trouble with his teenage girlfriend and an incident where he ingested pills and cut his wrist, leading to a call from his girlfriend to his mother, Carolyn. Despite concerns, his mother, a registered nurse, saw no signs of serious health risk at that time.

The situation escalated when Lance's girlfriend's parents instructed him to stay away from their daughter. In a state of distress, Lance cut his left wrist with a pocket knife and hid from the officers in the woods, returning only to insist that his brother, Larry, let him ""finish it."" The officers then took Lance into custody and transported him to the emergency room (ER) at Providence Health Care in Waco, where he was examined by a nurse, Mary Theresa Fox, and by ER physician James C. Pettit. While his previous suicide attempt and a family history of mental illness increased his risk of suicide, Lance's assessment in the ER was brief, and neither Fox nor Pettit conducted a comprehensive evaluation of his suicide risk.

Despite concerns, Lance was released that same morning on the conditions that he sign a no-suicide contract, follow-up with the Mental Health and Mental Retardation (MHMR) center on Tuesday, and promise to stay with his family until then. Over the weekend, Lance’s mother took measures to surround him with family and monitor him closely, and while Lance repeatedly assured her he would be okay, he ultimately ended his life by hanging himself 33 hours after being discharged from the ER.

Lance's parents, Carolyn and Jimmy Dowell, brought a wrongful death and survival action against the health care providers, alleging negligence in the ER's discharge of Lance without a proper assessment of his suicide risk, which they claimed was the proximate cause of his death. The jury sided with the Dowells, finding the defendants liable and awarding damages. The trial court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict, and upon appeal, a divided Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. The health care providers then appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas.","The Supreme Court of Texas held that there was a lack of proximate cause between Lance Dowell's discharge from the emergency room and his eventual suicide. The Court reasoned in a forward-looking manner that, based on the factual background, there was no evidence indicating that Lance could have been involuntarily hospitalized or would have consented to hospitalization voluntarily. Even if there were negligence in conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, this negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about Lance's suicide, which was deemed too remote in time and circumstances from Lance's release from the ER.

The Supreme Court would rule that any connection between Lance’s discharge and his subsequent suicide was too attenuated to establish proximate cause. The Court would assert that Lance had control over staying at the facility or leaving, and both he and his family did not display belief in the necessity of hospitalization. Lance had specifically communicated his desire not to be hospitalized, and there was no demonstrated legal basis for holding him against his will.

Furthermore, the Court would note that any predicted hospitalization would not have evidently made Lance's suicide unlikely, as there was no testimony to this effect that met the standards of proof necessary for legal causation. The Court would also emphasize that Lance displayed no unusual conduct following his discharge and that none of his family or friends expressed concern or believed further treatment was mandatory. The Court would thus project that Lance’s post-discharge assurances and the absence of alarming behavior would negate the impact of the health care providers’ conduct on his death.

Given these considerations, the Supreme Court would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, predicting that it would render judgment for the health care providers due to insufficiency of evidence concerning proximate causation."
"The appellant, Excel Corporation (Excel), a meatpacking plant in Friona, Texas, appealed a judgment in favor of the appellee, Jimmy Apodaca, regarding his injuries sustained during the course of his employment. Apodaca worked at Excel for 17 years, with the last three years spent operating a cryovac 8300 machine which required repetitive motions. He reported pain in his hand, neck, and lower back, and completed an employee statement of injury on April 29, 1995. While the costs for his carpal tunnel injury were initially covered by Excel, they ceased payment after one physician reported the injury resolved in August 1995. The costs for his other injuries were not covered by Excel.

Apodaca filed a lawsuit alleging that his cumulative trauma injuries resulted from Excel's negligence in failing to provide a safe workplace. The jury found Excel negligent and awarded actual damages of $536,472. The trial court affirmed the jury's verdict. Excel's appeal raised several issues, including an objection to not striking a prospective juror for bias, challenging the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, and rulings on jury instructions regarding sole proximate cause, new and independent cause, separate negligence questions for multiple injuries, and comments on the effect of the jury's answers. Excel also contested the award of over three years of prejudgment interest due to alleged delay by Apodaca in filing the trial.

During the trial, evidence was presented that the cryovac machine operation involved risk factors associated with cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs), such as repetitive motion and excessive production line speeds—with workers discouraged from slowing or stopping the line. Despite recommendations from OSHA and the presence of a high injury rate among machine operators, Excel did not enact suggested ergonomic changes. Various physicians offered conflicting testimonies on whether Apodaca's injuries were work-related, but overall, the jury could have inferred that the work environment was the cause of the injuries.","The appellate court's verdict was to affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of Apodaca. The decision found no reversible error with the trial court's rulings, including the juror challenge, as bias was not conclusively demonstrated. The causation evidence, while not strong, allowed the jury to reasonably infer that Apodaca's work environment and Excel's negligence were factors in his injuries. 

The appellate court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its decisions on jury instructions and did not err in refusing to submit additional instructions that merely duplicated questions already presented. Regarding damages, there was no abuse of discretion since the jury was tasked to award damages only for injuries found to be caused by Excel's negligence. The appellate court held that the trial court's charge did not inappropriately comment on the effect of the jury's answers, and the award of prejudgment interest was not an abuse of discretion, even considering the potential delay in filing the lawsuit.

In conclusion, the appellate court overruled all of Excel's issues since the trial court's actions were found not to have likely caused the rendition of an improper judgment. The judgment in favor of Apodaca was affirmed, with one justice dissenting on the basis that evidence of causation was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding."
"The appellants, H. A. Copeland and wife Lois Copeland, initially filed a lawsuit against W. M. Massie after their son, H. A. Copeland, Jr., tragically drowned while swimming in an open pit on Massie's property. After Massie's death intestate on January 22, 1949, the appellants included Massie's surviving spouse, Lela M. Massie, and children, W. A. Massie and Geraldine Massie Murray, as party defendants. The trial court sustained the appellees' special exception, which contended that the appellants failed to plead a cause of action.

The appellants claimed the property owned by the Massies was a hazard, particularly to minors, due to the presence of a large, deep pit filled with muddy water, which was the result of caliche being removed from the property years prior. The pit, being visible from the surrounding residences, unpaved streets, and a paved highway, was known or should have been known to attract children for swimming. They argued that the Massies were aware that children frequented the pit for swimming or should have known this through the exercise of ordinary care. The appellants' son, a fourteen-year-old boy with no experience swimming in such conditions, did not appreciate the dangers of the pit and consequently drowned. Efforts to rescue and recover the boy were hampered by the pit's size, steep banks, and murky waters. The appellants cited the Massies' negligence in failing to prevent the pit from filling with water, not enclosing it with a fence, not putting up warning signs, and not constructing drainage to control water flow. The Massies, in their defense, argued that the deceased had age-appropriate understanding of the risks of swimming in the pit and that the ""attractive nuisance doctrine"" did not apply as he was presumed to be a trespasser who knowingly encountered the danger.","In predicting the outcome, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a trial on the merits. The court will likely find that the appellants did manage to allege a cause of action against the appellees. It will be determined that the appellants presented a fact question suitable for a jury or trial court to decide: whether a normal boy of the age, experience, capacity, intelligence, and understanding of the deceased had the discretion to recognize the dangers of swimming in the pit. The fact-finding body will consider the individual qualities of the deceased child as compared with other children of his age and all the circumstances surrounding the death, including any specific dangers related to swimming in the pit. The court will likely hold that the age of the child is an important factor but not solely determinative.

The court will reject the appellees' contention that the child was a trespasser and will refer to precedents indicating that when children are attracted to a premises by something alluring, it can amount to an implied invitation; this aligns with the attractive nuisance doctrine. The court will emphasize that the actual knowledge or duty of care that the Massies had or should have had concerning the pit's danger to children, along with the feasibility and minimal expense of remedying the dangerous condition, should have been assessed.

The court will likely apply existing legal principles, such as those found in Texas case law and delineated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts §339, taking into account that the age and understanding of a child are critical factors in assessing potential liability. Neither the appellants' pleadings nor the appellees' arguments sufficiently resolve the factual questions related to the child's understanding of the risk and the Massies' negligence. Therefore, a trial on the merits will be necessary to ascertain the facts and apply the law accordingly."
"The case involves an appellant cab company seeking to overturn a trial court decision in favor of an injured son (Ascencion Gomez Vasquez) and his father, based on the rescue doctrine. Ascencion was struck by one of the cab company's drivers while attempting to rescue a girl lying in the middle of the road after a one-car accident. According to the facts, at approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 20, 1966, Ascencion was en route to his job when he witnessed a white car speed by and crash into a utility pole. As he approached the scene, he noticed several people fleeing from the crashed vehicle and saw the girl in the road. Ascencion, in an effort to help, stopped his car and, while attempting to attract the attention of an approaching taxi by waving his arms and shouting, was hit by the cab, fracturing his leg near the knee.

The cab driver, Daniel Vera Auces, was accompanied by a passenger and claimed to be traveling at 25 mph. He stated that he saw Ascencion's parked car but did not notice Ascencion himself until just before the impact. After hitting Ascencion, Auces stopped the cab a short distance away. Subsequently, it was discovered that the girl in the street had also been run over by the taxicab but left the scene with her friend post-accident. 

During the trial, the jury found that Auces had been primarily negligent for failing to maintain a proper lookout, appropriately apply brakes, or control the taxi's speed under the circumstances of his approach to the scene. However, the jury also found that Ascencion did not move out of the way in time, contributing to the accident. The jury then found that Ascencion had exercised ordinary care while attempting to rescue the girl by waving and shouting. The appellees did not request a jury instruction on a lesser standard of care applicable in rescue attempts, and the trial court ruled in their favor, awarding damages for medical expenses and loss of contributions, as well as a significant sum for Ascencion's injury and consequent reduced earning capacity.

The rescue doctrine acknowledges a person's attempt to aid others in imminent danger, accounting for the elevated risks taken under such circumstances. Ascencion's actions were found by the jury to align with those of an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances during the rescue attempt.","The appellate court will focus on the reconcilability of the jury's findings to determine the cab company's liability. The court will establish that the findings of the jury are in direct conflict: on one hand, the jury found Ascencion was negligent for not moving aside, which under normal circumstances could justify a take-nothing judgment in favor of the cab company; on the other hand, the jury also found that he behaved as an ordinary prudent person during the rescue attempt, which would normally negate the contributory negligence and support the trial court's judgment in favor of Ascencion.

The critical verdict component will be the standard of care required during the rescue attempt. Although the heroes' actions typically transcend those of an ordinary prudent person, the legal standard must accommodate the inherent risks in a rescue, which may require actions not aligning with typical standards of self-care. The appellate court will dissect whether the lower standard of care, such as ""rash"" or ""reckless"" behavior, was properly applied to Ascencion's actions during the rescue attempt, according to the instructions given to the jury.

The court will scrutinize how the jury was directed to reconcile the higher risks assumed during a rescue with the standard of care expected from an ordinary prudent person, absent the rescue context. Since the jury was instructed to apply the same standard of care, the findings may be viewed as incompatible, leading the appellate court to reverse the trial court judgment for a fundamental inconsistency. The court will likely parse the intricacies of the rescue doctrine and its implications on a rescuer's standard of care, ultimately concluding that Ascencion should not face a higher bar for contributory negligence during a rescue attempt. 

However, considering that there was no formal pleading or specific finding to support the lowered care standard during a rescue, and the rescue doctrine itself anticipates negligence by the defendant that created the peril, but without a specific finding on that issue, there may be a technical inadequacy in applying the rescue doctrine to justify the trial court's judgment.

In conclusion, the appellate court's reasoning will likely be grounded in the irreconcilable jury findings about Ascencion's care during the rescue attempt versus his contributory negligence, necessitating a reversal of the trial court's ruling and a remand for further proceedings consistent with the proper standards and interpretations of the rescue doctrine."
"On September 16, 1989, a police officer named Thomas Airington brought a lawsuit against a group of protesters who were demonstrating in front of the Reproductive Services Clinic in El Paso. Officer Airington alleged that while attempting to physically remove protester Sylvia Salazar from the clinic after she refused a police order to leave, he injured his back. He claimed that each of the defendants, who were part of the protest, were negligent and that their negligence proximately caused his injury.

The defendants were Samuel Oppenheim, the organizer of the protest, and other protesters named Maria Juhl, Breck Landry, Martha Arellano, Richard D. Weiss, Betty F. Jameson, Grace Madrid, Barbara Shepard Baldwin, Shirley Riordan, James Gose, and Aileen Gose. Airington's lawsuit accused the defendants of actions such as creating a dangerous situation for officers, not leaving premises upon lawful order, and failing to assist the police in the removing of Salazar and themselves.

Most of the protesters had decided to go to the clinic to disrupt activities by refusing police orders and potentially subjecting themselves to arrest. In doing so, they intended to adopt a passive resistance method which involved ""going limp."" Before the protest, they were advised on how to respond if confronted by police; however, it was left up to each individual whether to obey police orders or resist and face arrest.

Following discovery, all the defendants except Salazar and Oppenheim moved for summary judgment. They argued that they had no duty to prevent Salazar from injuring Airington, that their actions or inactions were not a proximate cause of Airington's injury, and that no defendant controlled any other protester. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and severed the remaining actions to make its judgment final and appealable. The court of appeals reversed this decision, claiming that the defendants had not conclusively disproved either duty or causation.","The verdict will center on the conclusion that there is no theory under which the participating demonstrators can be held liable for the injury sustained by Officer Airington. The court will render judgment that the plaintiff takes nothing since the police officer's injury was not a foreseeable consequence of the protesters' conduct.

The court will articulate that the actions of the petitioners were not ""highly dangerous or likely to cause serious injury or death,"" which mitigates against the imposition of liability. Further supporting the petitioners' case is the emphasis on individual choice—each protester decided independently how to respond to law enforcement. The lack of direct control over one another amongst the protesters means that liability cannot be grounded in group association alone.

The opinion will underline that no existing Texas case law automatically imposes liability of group members for the misdeeds of an individual member within that group. If the demonstrators were part of an unincorporated association, the court will reason that even within that context, liability should not be imposed based solely on group affiliation.

The court will dispel the ""concert of action"" theory as a basis for the respondent's recovery, as it requires an agreement to perform a tortious act, and no evidence suggests that the defendants either agreed to injure the police officer or intentionally engaged in dangerous conduct. The absence of substantial assistance or encouragement to engage in a wrongful act will also undermine causation arguments.

Moreover, the court will not find any defendants' actions as significantly contributing to the harm — they neither provided moral support to Salazar nor had any direct control over other defendants' actions during the protest. With a lack of foreseeability of the injury, given the trained and expected competencies of police officers, the summary judgment evidence will be found conclusive in disproving any recognized or theoretical duty breached by the petitioners towards Officer Airington. The court's overall reasoning will reveal the significant barriers to recovery for the plaintiff under the facts and the rule of law applied, hence reversing the court of appeals' judgment and rendering judgment in favor of the petitioners."
"Keys & Casey, property owners and partners, filed a lawsuit against the Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Company (Telephone Company) and the Belton & Temple Traction Company (Traction Company) to recover $400 in damages for the loss of their two horses. The horses were alleged to have been killed on March 16, 1906, while on Pearl Street in the city of Belton, Texas. The horses came into contact with a wire from the Telephone Company that had fallen across a trolley wire of the Traction Company and into the street. A jury trial in the County Court of Bell County resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs, Keys & Casey, awarding them $200 from both defendants.

The Telephone Company and the Traction Company appealed, arguing that the court should have followed their request to instruct the jury that the incident was caused by an inevitable accident or act of God, in which case the jury should find in favor of the defendants. The appellants contended that the court should have set aside the jury's verdict and granted a new trial. They presented evidence suggesting that the wire was in good condition before the accident and that the cause of it falling was a severe storm with hail, wind, lightning, and heavy rain. The Telephone Company detailed that a heavy storm that night led to one of its properly maintained wires being struck by lightning and falling, an act of God over which they had no control.

The property owners maintained that the defendants had been negligent in their duties to maintain and insulate the wires and guard where their wires crossed, leading to the accident. They argued that the evidence from the trial sufficiently supported the jury's verdict and the court's judgment.

The defense claimed that there was no concurring negligence between the two companies, as the accident resulted from the wire being struck by lightning, which they could not have prevented. Furthermore, they argued that the wires were made from high-quality materials and were in good condition, thus the accident was an act of God.","The court reversed the judgment in favor of the property owners and rendered judgment in favor of the Telephone Company and the Traction Company. The reasoning for this outcome was based on the conclusion that the wire falling and resulting in the death of the horses was an unavoidable accident caused by an act of God, specifically the severe storm and lightning on the night in question. The court believed that the evidence showed that the striking of the telephone wire by lightning was the proximate cause of the horses' deaths. The court found that there was no evidence of concurrent negligence on the part of the Telephone Company for failing to insulate its wires or on the part of the Traction Company for failing to maintain guard wires. The lack of a causal link between the alleged negligence and the accident led the court to determine that the peremptory instruction – which would have directed the jury to find for the defendants – should have been given. Consequently, any negligence, such as maintaining weak, dangerous, or rusted wires as alleged by the property owners, did not contribute to the incident, and thus the companies were not liable for the deaths of the horses. Given the verdict was based on the ruling that the accident was caused by an act of God and there was no evidence supporting concurring negligence by the defendants, the court reversed and rendered the judgment in favor of the appellants."
"The background of the case involves an employee, hereinafter referred to as plaintiff, who suffered a hernia whilst working to remove a hand rail car from his employer's tracks along with his supervisor and another laborer. The plaintiff initiated a personal injury lawsuit against his employer, the appellant, arguing that the supervisor's negligence in dropping the car was the proximate cause of his injury. The plaintiff presented two grounds of negligence: 1) the negligence of the supervisor in improperly handling the hand car, and 2) the employer's failure to furnish an adequate number of men to safely carry out the task. 

At trial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $2,500 in damages. The appellant employer filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, leading to an appeal. During the appeal, the appellant contested the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury to return a verdict in its favor, among other things. The evidence presented in the trial showed detailed accounts of how the supervisor and the plaintiff attempted to move the hand car, the supervisor's sudden dropping of the car, and the immediate impact and pain experienced by the plaintiff. Additionally, testimony was given regarding the inadequate number of employees present to handle the car safely, and the supervisor's comments immediately following the incident that implied a recognition of inadequate staffing. The appellant attempted to argue that the plaintiff’s injury was the result of his physical condition and that he assumed the risks associated with the job, including the injury that occurred.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court will hold that the evidence sufficiently demonstrated the supervisor's negligence as the proximate cause of the plaintiff's hernia, thus upholding the jury's findings. The defense's first argument for a directed verdict will be rebuffed because the plaintiff's claims of negligence, particularly regarding the supervisor's actions, were supported by ample evidence that justified presenting the question to the jury.

The court will find that a peremptory instruction was not appropriate as the evidence was contested regarding the proximate cause of the injury and ordinary minds could infer that the injury was indeed due to the supervisor's actions rather than the inadequacy of the staff provided.
 
The court will also dismiss the appellant's contention that the plaintiff's pre-existing weak, sick, or diseased condition was the proximate cause of the injury. The court will establish that the plaintiff's physical condition did not contribute to the injury and that the evidence asserted this point clearly. 

Furthermore, the court will discount the appellant’s challenge to the introduction of testimony about the supervisor’s post-incident exclamation as it was relevant and qualified as part of the res gestae given its direct relation to the transaction. The court will suggest that any objection to the admission of this testimony should have been contemporaneously addressed at trial with a motion to strike or a directed request for the jury to disregard it, failure of which precludes the appellant from assigning reversible error on such basis at the appeal stage.

In conclusion, the court will uphold the trial verdict, finding no reversible errors in the record and substantiating the jury's determination of negligence on the supervisor's part as the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries."
"On April 4, 1992, Manuel Carrasco, who was seventeen years old, and James Gabriel, whose age is not specified, purchased CCI .22 long rifle mini-mag bullets from a Kmart store. Carrasco and Gabriel took the ammunition and a .22 caliber pistol they had acquired from Carrasco's younger brother and engaged in target shooting. Later, as they drove with friends, including Leonard Bell, they picked up beer, drove to the countryside to drink, and returned to a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant. That evening, in the town of Denison, they engaged in ""cruising"" and seeking a fight. During an encounter with Richard Cowart, Bell managed to get hold of the loaded pistol and, not knowing it was loaded, shot and killed Richard Cowart.

Legal actions ensued with criminal charges leading to convictions for involuntary manslaughter against both Bell and Carrasco. Subsequently, the Cowarts, Richard's parents, filed a civil suit against Carrasco, Gabriel, and Kmart. Their claim against Kmart was based on its alleged negligence in selling ammunition to minors. Kmart moved for summary judgment, claiming that the shooting was not foreseeable and that the shooter's conduct constituted an intervening and superseding cause of death, negating Kmart's liability. The trial court granted Kmart's motion for summary judgment.","The court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Kmart, concluding that Kmart's sale of ammunition to Carrasco and Gabriel could not be considered the proximate cause of Richard Cowart's death. Kmart's defense will successfully argue that the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the sale, primarily because one would expect a seventeen-year-old to have the capability to appreciate the risks associated with handling ammunition responsibly. Moreover, the court will find that the chain of events leading to the shooting was highly extraordinary, further obstructing a direct link between Kmart's actions and the fatal incident.

The court is likely to examine the legal concept of foreseeability and the nature of superseding causes as delineated by the Restatement (Second) of Torts. In addition to the foreseeability, the court will consider if the intervening act of Bell, who was not sold the ammunition directly and acted independently from Kmart's sale, brought about a different kind of harm than what the initial act could have produced. The court may also consider that Bell's criminal act, a key point, would effectively shield Kmart from liability as Kmart could not have anticipated that its sale of ammunition to Carrasco and Gabriel could culminate in such a criminal act by Bell.

The court will likely underscore the significance of the six Restatement factors in establishing Bell’s act as a superseding cause. It will conclude that the Cowarts have failed to provide adequate evidentiary support for their claim that Kmart could have foreseen the criminal application of the bullets by Bell. Consequently, the court will determine that no factual issue exists regarding the foreseeability element necessary for negligence, leading to upholding the summary judgment for Kmart."
"The background of the case involves a fire in a four-plex apartment building owned by the appellant landlord, C.L. Daniels a/k/a C.L. Mayon. Appellee Roseletta Mitchell and her two children, Kori Johnson and Kourtney Mitchell, were tenants in the building. On November 16, 1994, a fire broke out when Kourtney, age five, overturned a candle. Roseletta and her children initially escaped uninjured, and Kori, age nine, called 911. After five to seven minutes outside, Roseletta re-entered the building to alert other tenants but did not hear functioning smoke detectors. Kori followed to look for his mother and tragically died in the fire due to burns, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide toxicity.

The apartment's smoke detector beeped for less than a second and stopped, and no other alarms were heard as there were no smoke detectors in common areas. The appellees sued Daniels for negligence and gross negligence, resulting in Kori's death, arguing that Daniels failed to install or maintain proper fire safety devices and had non-compliant burglar bars on windows. The bench trial resulted in a $1,000,000 verdict against Daniels. Daniels appealed, arguing that there was no violation of Tex. Prop. Code § 92.251 et seq. regarding smoke detector installation and that there was insufficient evidence of causation. At trial, Roseletta testified about complaints to Daniels regarding the smoke detector, which Daniels did not contest.","The appellate court affirmed the trial verdict in favor of the appellees. It held that Daniels had waived her defense regarding non-compliance with the Texas Smoke Detector Statute because she did not raise the issue at trial. Even though Daniels moved for a judgment asserting no evidence of causation and also made a post-judgment motion for a new trial based on causation, she did not challenge the appellees' compliance with the request and notice provisions at any point.

Furthermore, the court found that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the lack of functioning smoke detectors was the cause in fact of the appellees' injuries. Given the absence of alarms, Roseletta's decision to re-enter the building to warn other tenants and Kori's subsequent re-entry to look for his mother were considered foreseeable. It was reasonable for them to believe that they needed to rescue others due to the lack of functioning smoke detectors and alarms. Danielle failed to install and maintain smoke detectors throughout the building, which constituted negligence and created an emergency situation requiring rescue efforts.

By applying the rescue doctrine, the court concluded that the acts of the rescuers (Roseletta and Kori) were foreseeable results of Daniels's negligent actions, as they attempted to mitigate the imminent peril caused by the absence of warning devices. The evidence was sufficient both legally and factually to support the trial court’s findings of both cause in fact and foreseeability, justifying the decision to affirm the trial court's judgment against Daniels."
"The case involves a lawsuit filed by Clyde Dalrymple and his wife Edith Dalrymple, as parents and legal representatives of their deceased minor son, Danny Dalrymple. They sued Parking, Inc., along with Zaragosa Amusement Company and the City of San Antonio, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries leading to the death of their son Danny. The incident occurred when Danny, accompanied by his uncle B.J. Dalrymple, fell into San Pedro Creek adjacent to a public parking lot operated by Parking, Inc., in San Antonio, Texas, where they had intended to go to the nearby Alameda Theatre.

The parking lot, owned by Zaragosa Amusement Company, was leased to Parking, Inc., which did not construct any fences or barriers along the property line bordering the creek. The parking lot layout involved cars parking with rear wheels backed up to the ground-placed telephone poles, and some of the cars extended over the open creek bed. There were no designated pedestrian exits from the parking lot. On the day of the incident, a heavy rain obscured visibility, and there was no warning provided about the potential hazard of the creek.

Danny and his uncle B.J. had parked in the lot, and while running to the theatre, both fell into what appeared to be a walkway but was the creek. B.J. managed to survive, and rescuers later found Danny's body downstream. B.J. recounted the events to various individuals before dying in an unrelated truck accident, but his statements were not recorded or formally documented since his deposition was never taken. The uncle's accounts were considered hearsay and presented a central issue at trial.

The Dalrymples alleged that Parking, Inc., was negligent for failing to install protective barriers or provide warnings about the creek's hazardous conditions. The trial court admitted B.J.'s hearsay statements and entered a judgment in the Dalrymples' favor. The judgment awarded damages for funeral expenses, loss suffered by the parents, and pain and mental anguish suffered by Danny. Parking, Inc. appealed, challenging the judgment and the admission of hearsay evidence, among other claims.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment favoring the Dalrymples and remand for a new trial. The reversal will be based on the trial court's error in admitting the hearsay statements made by B.J. Dalrymple as res gestae, which did not meet the criteria for admissibility and were prejudicial to Parking, Inc., as they primarily established that Danny fell from the parking lot premises.

In the new trial, the court will likely find a possibility to properly lay a sufficient predicate for the admission of some of B.J.'s statements, which could potentially be admissible as part of res gestae if made under specific circumstances that suggest spontaneity and direct relation to the occurrence.

Parking, Inc.'s assertion that the accident was not foreseeable as a matter of law will be rejected based on the general principles that an invitee of a parking lot includes those accompanying the primary invitee and that the parking lot owner owed a duty to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. As such, the owner is expected to protect invitees from foreseeable dangers, and to inspect to discover those conditions.

The parking lot's history of no prior incidents of visitors falling into the creek and the heavy rainfall alone will not relieve Parking, Inc. of liability, as it was still a foreseeable circumstance that heavy rain could occur, and that obscured visibility could lead to an invitee falling into the creek. The jury's rejection of the defense's position regarding a new and intervening cause and unavoidable accident will be seen as having a basis in evidence.

Ultimately, the appellate court will anticipate that upon a retrial, there could be evidence presented that supports the notion that Parking, Inc. could reasonably foresee someone falling into the obscured creek and thus had a duty either to erect a barrier or provide a warning about the hazard."
"In 2008, Gerald B. Hindy, president and CEO of AG Financial Solutions, met with Lance Duncan about investing in the oil and gas industry. AG Financial Solutions created Steward Energy to purchase oil and gas properties identified by Duncan, namely the Batson and Wortham leases, for a total of $10.5 million. Despite the purchase, the leases operated at a loss, leading to a dispute settlement in 2009 where Mark III agreed to pay Steward Energy $1,080,000.

In 2010, AG Financial Solutions and Steward Energy sued Duncan for various claims related to these transactions. The parties ultimately settled, with Duncan's entities agreeing to certain terms, including executing a promissory note for $9,500,000 secured by a deed of trust and the defendants signing a Confession of Judgment for $6,000,000, which was to be offset by payments made according to the promissory note terms.

A second settlement in 2013 acknowledged the outstanding judgment and set conditions for its reduction based on the outstanding sums owed to Steward Energy. A Consolidated Loan Agreement was also executed to combine outstanding debts. The Deed of Trust provided security for this agreement. In 2014, Ride the Wave, LLC sued Duncan and his entities, leading to the termination of a purchase and sale agreement (PSA) with Ryder Operating, LLC.

Steward Energy foreclosed Duncan's assets, including the Bateson and Wortham leases and Duncan's lake house, due to defaults under the loan agreement. In 2016, Duncan's entities filed suit against Appellees (including Steward Energy, AG Financial Solutions, and Hindy), claiming tortious interference, wrongful foreclosure, among other things, and seeking declaratory judgment.

Appellees asserted affirmative defenses such as release and res judicata. During the case, litigation in Freestone County also transpired, where a turnover proceeding resulted in a judgment against Duncan's entities, which they unsuccessfully attempted to overturn. The trial court ruled in favor of Appellees.","Given the history and circumstances of the case, the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of Appellees concerning Appellants' claims for tortious interference with the PSA, wrongful foreclosure, and declaratory relief was rooted in well-established legal principles including res judicata and the interpretation of contract and deed terms. Res judicata was applicable because Appellants' claim for declaratory relief could have been raised during the turnover proceeding. Concerning the wrongful foreclosure claim, the non-material alterations to the deed of trust did not render it void, and thus the foreclosure was not wrongful as the original deed of trust allowed for foreclosure given a default.

For the tortious interference claim, Appellees provided conclusive evidence that the PSA contained provisions allowing Ryder Operating to terminate the agreement validly, without breaching it. Ryder Operating exercised its contractual rights due to misrepresentations and breach of warranties by Mark III, rather than as a result of Appellees’ inducement. In summary, the trial court's decision was predicated on the doctrine of res judicata, the validity of foreclosure proceedings, and the interpretation of contractual rights within the PSA, which established that Appellees neither willfully interfered with the PSA nor wrongfully foreclosed on Appellants' assets. The Appellees’ actions were within their rights based on the established terms of the contracts and judicial findings, supporting the trial court's denial of Appellants' claims."
"The appellant in this case is the Pecos & Northern Texas Railway Company, and the appellee is Robert Collins, a former employee of the railway company. Collins was employed as a section foreman and was required to handle and unload railway ties that had been treated with a chemical solution known as creosote. On May 27, 1912, while unloading wet, creosoted ties, Collins' hands and face began to burn, and his skin was consequently damaged. Collins was unaware of the risks associated with handling creosoted ties, as he had never worked with such ties in the wet state before. Conversely, the railway company argued they were unaware that the creosote could cause such injuries when contacting the skin.

Collins alleged that the railway company knew or should have known that the ties were dangerous and that handling them could result in poisoning. He claimed the company negligently failed to warn him of this danger, leading to his injuries and subsequent health issues such as swelling, feverish limbs, paralysis, constant headaches, dizzy and numb spells, as well as damage to his back, kidneys, intestines, and other internal organs. Moreover, he contended that his nervous system was severely affected, causing him to suffer both mentally and physically, with an impact on his earning capacity and quality of life.

The jury initially found in favor of Collins, and the railway company's motion for a new trial was overruled by the trial court. The company contended that the trial court erred in not granting a peremptory charge (a direction to enter a particular verdict) and that the evidence did not show the company was aware of the potential for systemic injury from external contact with creosote. Expert testimonies during the trial were mixed, with some supporting the possibility that creosote could cause systemic poisoning and others arguing that the symptoms Collins experienced were not typical of creosote poisoning and could be attributed to another illness, such as pellagra—a conclusion the railway company's medical experts reached.

Moreover, witnesses who had handled creosoted ties in the past testified that they had never suffered injuries beyond minor skin burns. The evidence presented showed that creosote was known to cause burns when it came into contact with the skin but typically did not result in the sort of systemic poisoning that Collins experienced. It was also noted that Collins' symptoms were indicative of the disease pellagra and he hadn't handled wet creosoted ties before this incident.","The court in the end reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of Collins. The justification will likely hinge on the distinction between the apparent risks associated with handling creosote, which could have been known by the railway company—like the potential for skin burns—and the unforeseen systemic health issues that Collins experienced. There was an absence of evidence to suggest that the railway company knew or should have known that handling creosote could lead to systemic poisoning, a condition not reported in medical literature or previously observed as a consequence of external creosote exposure.

Though Collins was found to have suffered serious constitutional disorders due to his exposure to creosote, the injuries for which he could seek compensation were limited to those that the railway company could reasonably have anticipated from such exposure. The verdict did not necessarily dispute that Collins suffered from his health conditions, but rather that such outcomes were not predictable effects of handling creosote, and as such, the railway company was not expected to warn employees about risks that were not reasonably foreseeable.

Based on the evidence and testimony presented, the court will likely reason that the railway company could not be found negligent for failing to anticipate a rare constitutional injury that had not been documented prior to this case and was not a known probable consequence of external creosote exposure. As a result, the court will probably support its reversal by emphasizing the principle that an employer is not liable for unforeseen and atypical consequences of their acts that could not have been foreseen as the usual and probable result of negligence. Consequently, Collins might be entitled to damages only for the skin burns caused by creosote but not for the more severe and unexpected health issues he experienced. Given this, the case will be remanded for a new trial where Collins can pursue damages that are deemed reasonably foreseeable by the court based on the nature of creosote and the information available to the railway company at the time."
"The case involves a boundary dispute that escalated into an unneighborly fight between Bradford Turner and Jim Dudley. Bradford and his wife, Pat Turner, sued Jim and his wife, Mary Dudley, for assault, trespass, and a declaratory judgment concerning the overuse of an easement by the Dudleys. The Dudleys counterclaimed for damages to Jim's back and leg resulting from the assault. A jury sided with the Dudleys regarding the easement’s placement and use, which had been in place since they acquired the property in 1979, and found Bradford guilty of assaulting Jim. The trial court's judgment awarded Jim $57,764.58 in damages for the assault, encompassing medical bills and compensation for physical and mental suffering. The judgment referred to a 1946 case which had previously established a 24-foot easement for the Dudleys’ predecessors and an agreed 2008 judgment that resolved disputes and defined easement usage rights, preventing the Turners from interfering. The current trial court also ordered a modern survey of the roadway's actual placement, aligning it with previous adjudications regarding the easement.

On appeal, the Turners challenged the award of damages for the assault (disputing the causal relationship between the fight and Jim’s medical conditions) and contested the easement claims, arguing that the trial court essentially granted a new easement by prescription over their land. The Turners contended that the prior judgments did not entail the easement they were accused of infringing upon. It was brought up that Jim had a history of back problems and had undergone back surgeries before the altercation with Bradford. Medical records from treating surgeon Marcella Madera, M.D., were discussed, including progress notes following the assault which expressed concern but ultimately showed Jim's improvement post-surgery once scar tissue from prior surgeries was removed.","The court is likely to affirm in part and reverse and remand in part. Concerning the Turners' first point of error—the alleged award of a new easement to the Dudleys—the verdict will likely uphold the trial court's decision. The appellate court will determine that the Turners' argument about the trial court granting a new easement is unsupported by the record. Since the easement in question was established in the 1946 judgment and referred to in the 2008 agreed judgment without any expansion, the verdict on the easement dispute will stand without change.

Regarding the damages awarded to Jim for his medical conditions, the court will probably agree with the Turners that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the fight was the proximate cause of all of Jim's injuries. Although Madera's progress notes indicate concern that the fight could have worsened Jim's condition, they do not provide conclusive evidence on a reasonable medical probability. With the pain alleviated by removing scar tissue rather than direct damages from the altercation, the evidence cannot definitively link Jim's ongoing medical issues to the fight. Therefore, the court will likely rule that a lay jury could not reasonably establish a causal relationship without expert testimony and reverse Jim's award of damages.

Consequently, the court will remand the case for a new trial to accurately determine the damages directly attributable to the assault. This will necessitate professional medical testimony to make clear which of Jim's injuries, if any, were proximately caused by the altercation with Bradford. In all other regards, except for the awarded damages, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment without variation."
"The case involves a premises liability action against Amoco Chemicals Corporation, which owned and operated premises where an accident involving a nitrogen-filled reactor occurred. The reactor was located in the ""ultracracker unit"" at Amoco's Texas City refinery. The incident resulted in the deaths of Robert Milton Sutton and Aquiles Salinas, who were employees of Arsco, Inc., a sandblasting and painting contractor. Charles Marzka, an employee of Catalyst Services, Inc., another contractor, sustained injuries while attempting to rescue Sutton and Salinas. Arsco was under contract with Amoco and had an express indemnity provision in the contract. Amoco sought indemnity from Arsco after a jury verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs—survivors of the deceased and for the insurance companies who intervened due to workers' compensation claims. Both Sutton and Salinas met their deaths in reactor 101-D, one of three identical reactors equipped with temporary elevators installed by Amoco; these reactors were accessed via ladders. Appellant Amoco argued that Sutton and Salinas were not invitees when they entered the reactor, given that Amoco had no duty towards them at that particular place; they further contended knowledge of the danger associated with the reactor by Reyer, the supervisor of Sutton and Salinas, was enough to absolve Amoco of liability, and that Sutton had been warned of the dangers of nitrogen in the reactor. During the purge of the reactor with nitrogen, none of Amoco's safety measures were followed—no barriers, signs, tags, or warning personnel in place. The jurors concluded Sutton and Salinas were indeed invitees at the time of their deaths, and their entry into the reactor was reasonably foreseeable by Amoco, who owed them a duty to keep the premises safe. On the question of indemnity, Amoco argued for indemnification from Arsco under the contract regarding the deaths, which the jury agreed with, but also for Marzka's injuries, which the jury did not find Arsco responsible for.","The court affirmed the judgment that Amoco premises owner owed a duty of care to Sutton and Salinas as invitees to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The court held that due to Amoco's negligence, which created the dangerous condition that led to the deaths of Sutton and Salinas, Amoco was liable for the resulting damages. Since it was reasonably foreseeable that persons like Sutton and Salinas would enter the reactor, and given that no safety measures were enforced during the dangerous nitrogen purge procedure, Amoco failed in its duty as the occupier of the premises. The court also found that the third party (Arsco) was liable for indemnification to Amoco for the deaths, but not for the personal injuries sustained by Marzka, as the latter's injuries were deemed the result solely of Amoco’s actions, not contributory to Arsco's negligence. As to the indemnity claim, although Amoco's premises owner was entitled to indemnification from Arsco for the deaths due to the indemnity agreement, the court held that Amoco could not be indemnified for Marzka's injuries because those resulted from Amoco's sole negligence, as determined by the jury. Thus, Amoco was not entitled to any indemnity from Arsco regarding Marzka’s injuries, leading the court to reverse this portion of the judgment. In conclusion, Amoco failed to protect invitees on its premises and was held liable for damages associated with the incident. Additionally, the court outlined the limits of the indemnity provision in the contract, highlighting that the protection it provided did not extend to incidents resulting from the indemnified party's sole negligence.

"The plaintiff in error (the insurer) issued a one-year fire insurance policy to the defendant in error (Mrs. Mims) on July 2, 1917, covering a one-story brick building in Midland, Texas, for an amount not exceeding $2,500. The insurance policy included an explosion clause that exempted the insurer from liability for loss caused directly or indirectly by an explosion unless a fire ensued, and then only for fire damage. It also included a falling building clause specifying that insurance would cease if a building or any part thereof fell, except as the result of fire.

On May 28, 1918, an explosion occurred in the Westmoreland Building, which was immediately adjacent and adjoining the Mims Building. The explosion, caused by vaporized gasoline, demolished the Westmoreland Building and caused significant damage to the Mims Building. The Mims Building suffered almost complete destruction by the force of the explosion, and fire was present in the building when the first witnesses arrived. The fire damaged the Mims Building to some extent, but the primary damage was from the explosion.

Mrs. Mims sued the insurer to recover the total fire loss under the policy. The trial court awarded the insured the face value of the policy with interest. The insurer appealed the decision, questioning the application of the explosion and falling building clauses given the facts. The trial court had instructed the jury that the defendant was liable if fire caused an explosion that wrecked the Mims Building and that the plaintiff was to be awarded damages if the jury found this to be true.

The appellate court had to decide whether the falling building clause offered a defense against the loss by fire following the explosion, and whether the insurer was liable for damages from the explosion in the adjoining building caused by a fire therein. The burden of proof rested upon Mrs. Mims to show that her loss did not fall within the explosion clause exception.","Anticipating the reasoning for the verdict, the court will reverse the trial court’s decision and remand the action for a retrial, mainly because the falling building clause, when considered in context with the explosion clause, does not present a defense to the loss caused by the fire that ensued after the explosion. The existing legal consensus is that insurance against loss by fire includes all loss from explosions which are the direct result of an antecedent fire upon the insured premises. Since the fall of the Mims Building was caused by an explosion followed by a fire, the insurer is liable for the damage inflicted by the fire, but not for the damage from the explosion.

The appellate court will buttress its reasoning with precedent from similar cases where courts held that an ensuing fire's damages following an explosion led to liability under the explosion clause and the falling clause did not negate this. Such cases include Dows v. Ins. Co., Davis & Co. v. Ins. Co., and Leonard v. Ins. Co.

However, the core issue is whether the damage wrought by an explosion in the Westmoreland Building, caused by antecedent fire therein, falls within the scope of Mrs. Mims' insurance coverage. The appellate court will reason that the policy's explosion clause exempts the insurer from liability for damage caused by such an explosion. The court will consider the explosion as the proximate cause of the damage and the fire in Westmoreland Building as a remote cause. Based on the testimony and facts of the case, the fire originated in the Westmoreland Building and was communicated to the Mims Building by the explosion.

Since Mrs. Mims could not prove that the fire originated in her building, which could have implied that the explosion was caused by the fire on her premises, she failed to carry the burden of proof. The explosion thus remains the proximate cause of most damage, which the policy specifically exempted.

For these reasons, the court will determine that the insurer is liable only for damages caused by the fire following the explosion, not exceeding the policy's face amount. The absence of evidence of the specific amount of fire damage will necessitate the court's decision to reverse the trial court’s verdict and call for a new trial where proper evidence on fire damages can be presented. The other various questions presented by the case will be considered unnecessary for this decision."
"Appellant Arlington Memorial Hospital (""Arlington Memorial"") appealed a jury verdict in favor of appellee Johnny W. Baird (""Baird"") in his medical malpractice suit against the hospital. The case arose from an incident on August 12, 1993, when Baird underwent cataract removal surgery performed by Dr. Nirmal Saran at Arlington Memorial and sustained a corneal burn to his right eye. Baird claimed that the injury occurred because the surgeon used a previously used phacoemulsification tip, a device applied to the eye during the surgery to break the cataract into small particles for removal. The hospital regularly reused phaco tips until Baird's surgery, but it was disputed whether the tip used in Baird's surgery was actually used previously.

At trial, Baird sought to establish negligence on the part of the hospital through a nursing expert, Mary Scardino, R.N., who attempted to testify both about the standard of care and the medical causation of Baird's injury. The trial court permitted testimony regarding the standard of care but prohibited Scardino from testifying about the causation of Baird's burn, deeming her unqualified for such medical diagnostics. The hospital contested this exclusion and also argued that the trial court wrongly submitted the negligence issue to the jury due to a lack of evidence proving proximate causation.

Dr. Saran, Baird’s medical expert, testified that a thermal burn likely resulted in Baird's cystoid macular edema and stated that while various issues during surgery could cause a burn, he did not commit any errors, and the equipment was functioning properly upon testing. He thus reasoned the cause ""leaves the tip"" as a potential reason for the injury. However, he admitted that he could not ascertain with certainty whether the reused tip caused the burn, defining the possibility as a causation but falling short of a reasonable medical probability.

The trial court submitted the negligence issue to the jury, which found in favor of Baird, awarding damages for both negligence and gross negligence.","In the appeal, the court will focus on two main issues raised by Arlington Memorial. First, it will uphold the trial court's decision to limit the testimony of Mary Scardino, as she was not demonstrated to be qualified to medically diagnose thermal burns or be an expert on phacoemulsification equipment, which is essential for establishing causation in medical malpractice. This is consistent with prior case law distinguishing the qualifications necessary for nurses to testify regarding causation.

Secondly, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment for submitting the negligence issue to the jury, concluding that Baird failed to present more than speculative evidence as to the proximate cause of his injuries. Specifically, the court will find that Baird did not establish that there was a reasonable medical probability that Arlington Memorial's alleged negligence, reusing the tip, was a substantial factor in bringing about his injury. Baird’s reliance on mere possibilities, rather than preponderance of the evidence that would unequivocally link the hospital's actions to his injury, falls short of meeting the standard required to establish cause-in-fact under Texas law.

As a result, the court will reverse and render a judgment in favor of Arlington Memorial, effectively dismissing Baird's claim for failing to sufficiently prove that the hospital's alleged negligence was the proximate cause of his injury. The court will determine that the proper judgment should have been for the appellant because Baird did not provide substantiated evidence meeting the required threshold of reasonable medical probability. Therefore, the foreseeability element of proximate cause will also remain moot due to the absence of evidence supporting cause-in-fact."
"The case revolves around the tragic suicide of a thirteen-year-old girl, A.W., after she was treated for depression by her pediatric health-care providers at Pediatrics Cool Care. The patient had been a client of the practice since 2010 and on March 1, 2012, her mother brought A.W. to the clinic where she expressed feelings of constant sadness and an inability to control her emotions. Physician assistant Jenelle Robinson diagnosed A.W. with depression after a brief consultation, prescribed the antidepressant Celexa, and ""strongly recommended"" counseling. The medical record indicates that Robinson provided a list of counselors. A.W.'s mother, however, testified that no list was provided and that A.W. had refused counseling, preferring to rely on medication and a teacher at school for support.

Robinson's handling of the situation was questionable, as she did not recall if she had inquired about suicidal ideation or warned of Celexa's risks, though she stated it was likely she had done so following usual practice. Robinson also failed to ask A.W. privately about her feelings, did not use diagnostic checklists, and there was uncertainty over whether she instructed a follow-up visit. In addition, due to a transcription error, A.W. was prescribed three thirty-day refills for Celexa, which exceeded limits set by regulations.

On April 17, A.W. visited the practice again due to migraines. Nurse practitioner Allyn Kawalek examined her and, based on A.W. and her mother's reports, noted a positive change in mood. Subsequently, after A.W.'s parents filed a lawsuit, an unknown individual altered A.W.'s medical record from this visit.

Approximately three and a half months later, on July 31, A.W.'s mother called for a refill of the Celexa prescription. Medical assistant Bernadette Aguillon, without proper authorization, approved the refill despite A.W. being overdue for a follow-up. Aguillon later attempted to conceal this error by altering medical records after learning of A.W.'s suicide.

On the evening of August 14, A.W. was discovered dead by her mother, having committed suicide by an overdose of Benadryl. Both A.W.'s parents claimed they had no indication she was suicidal, nor had A.W. disclosed suicidal thoughts to anyone else.

A.W.'s parents sued Pediatrics Cool Care and involved healthcare providers (collectively, the providers), alleging negligence and gross negligence. Expert testimony was provided by Dr. Herschel Lessin on care deficiencies, but he did not testify on the cause of death. Another expert, Dr. Fred Moss, stated that despite the provider's negligence in prescribing Celexa, the drug was not a cause of A.W.'s suicide, and even if the providers had been negligent, A.W. might have committed suicide nonetheless. He postulated that had the providers asked the right questions, they could have presented A.W. with treatment pathways that might have prevented her suicide.

On the contrary, another expert, Dr. Armando Correa, stated that teenage suicide is often impulsive and, in most cases, cannot be prevented, though in A.W.'s case her suicide was considered to be an impulsive, unpreventable act.

The trial court asked the jury to determine if the providers proximately caused A.W.'s death. The jury found Dr. Salguero and Robinson liable and Kawalek not liable, resulting in a multi-million-dollar verdict, later reduced to $1.285 million. The liable providers appealed the sufficiency of evidence for the verdict, admission of Dr. Moss's testimony, and the calculation of prejudgment interest. The court of appeals affirmed the verdict without analyzing but-for causation and upheld Dr. Moss's testimony as factually grounded and reliable based on his experience and training.","The future prediction for the verdict in this case, considering the standard of but-for causation applied in medical malpractice cases leading to suicide, is that the court will reverse the judgment of the appellate court and render in favor of the medical providers. Despite the tragic outcome and identified negligence in the patient's care, the evidence from Dr. Moss would be deemed legally insufficient to meet the but-for causation standard required to establish proximate cause for medical negligence in a suicide case.

The test for but-for causation requires showing that the negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injury and that without the act or omission, the harm would not have occurred. Dr. Moss's testimony relied on a series of speculative assumptions: that had the providers correctly conducted an intake assessment, A.W. would have disclosed suicidal tendencies; that A.W. would have pursued treatment pathways provided by the providers; and that such treatments would have prevented her suicide.

Moreover, the expert testimony will not sufficiently exclude alternative plausible causes for the suicide. Without reliable scientific grounding to differentiate between patients who might commit suicide regardless of proper care and those who wouldn't, the court would require but-for causation as a standard.

Dr. Moss would be criticized for not presenting facts substantiating a concrete connection between A.W.'s treatment and her eventual suicide. It would be held that an expert's assumptions, however informed by clinical experience, must be supported by actual evidence in the record, not contradicted by the established facts such as the patient's prior refusal of counseling. Given the absence of evidence that without the providers' negligence, A.W.'s suicide would not have occurred, and due to the speculative nature of the expert testimony, the providers' negligence would be deemed too attenuated to be the proximate cause of the suicide. Therefore, the verdict would be rendered in favor of the providers, reversing the appellate court's judgment."
"The personal injury action in question arises from an accident that occurred on the night of February 16, 1955, involving a car hitting a train during a switching procedure. David Duffy, an 18-year-old high school senior, was a passenger in a 1941 Chevrolet automobile driven by Irving A. Hoff when the vehicle collided with a train operated by the defendant Railroad at a crossing in north Dallas County. The train was blocking the crossing, with part of it sitting directly on the crossing, and the remainder, including a caboose, extending south of the crossing. There were no lights or signals to indicate the blocked crossing, the portion of the train on the crossing was unlit, and the accident happened after dark on a moonless night. The track ran north-south, and the crossing was at grade with Belt Line Road.

The jury answered several questions concerning the circumstances of the accident, finding that the railroad crossing was more than ordinarily dangerous during nighttime switching operations, and that the railroad should have known this. They found the railroad’s failure to have a signal device or a flagman or to provide flares a proximate cause of the collision, while also finding that Hoff's manner of driving, including excessive speed and failure to keep a proper lookout, was negligent but not the sole cause of the accident. Plaintiff David Duffy was found not negligent.

The jury awarded damages to David Duffy for physical pain, mental suffering, loss of capacity to work, and earn money in the amount of $50,000. They also awarded Martin Duffy, David's father, $1,500 for medical expenses incurred. The railroad was aware of both the permanent and temporary conditions at the crossing and the high volume of traffic that passed through the area, as evidenced by prior traffic counts and a request from the county for the installation of signal lights at the crossing.

The Railroad's contention during the trial was that the crossing, being at a right angle with no curves or angles, would not be considered extra-hazardous, and any collision would result from the driver's negligence or a passenger's failure to warn. However, evidence from several witnesses, including past near-accidents and the lack of visibility of the train at night, supported the description of the crossing as extra-hazardous. The crossing was reportedly blocked frequently for switching operations, and this particular night the road would have been cleared in ""three or four minutes.""

The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs (Duffy), but the Railroad appealed, and the court reversed the decision. The Duffy plaintiffs then filed a motion for rehearing.","The motion for rehearing is going to be vacated because there is sufficient evidence that the crossing where the accident occurred was more than ordinarily dangerous at the time of night when switching operations were performed. This presents a fact issue that should be left to the jury to decide.

The court on rehearing will find that the Railroad had constructive knowledge of the dangerous conditions at the crossing due to the regularity of trains blocking the road for switching operations at night and the Railroad receiving a letter from the County Traffic Engineer expressing concerns about the crossing. The Railroad's failure to take action despite this knowledge supports a negligence finding.

In reaching a decision, the court will observe that the volume of roadway traffic is a significant factor in the character and risk assessment of a railroad crossing, as demonstrated by the daily traffic counts presented in evidence. Additionally, the lack of moonlight on the night of the accident contributed to the crossing's hazardous status, compounded by the dark-colored boxcars that were not reflective, causing approaching headlights to shine under the train instead of illuminating it.

The switching operations at this crossing differed from typical railroad crossings because the train was frequently stopped at the crossing for the interchange of cars. Coupled with the testimony of the train crew and a history of incidents, these distinguishing elements indicated an extra-hazardous condition. Observations from residents who had experienced near-collisions due to poor visibility of the train at night further substantiated the jury's findings.

The damage award for David Duffy will be upheld as reasonable and not excessive given the severe and permanent injuries he sustained, which were duly considered by the jury. The court will also conclude that there was no evidence of jury misconduct affecting the verdict.

For these reasons, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment for the plaintiffs, upholding the jury's determination of the Railroad's negligence and the award of the damages to David Duffy and Martin Duffy. The Railroad's contention that they were due a peremptory instruction will be dismissed, as the evidence supports the jury's finding of extra-hazardous conditions and the Railroad's failure to adequately signal the crossing. The Railroad's failure to investigate conditions at the crossing after being notified of traffic concerns will also weigh heavily against them. 

The trial court's original judgment in favor of the father and son plaintiffs will stand, confirming the Railroad's knowledge of the dangerous crossing conditions and its negligence in failing to provide adequate warnings for motorists."
"In the late 1980s, Tom Chambers became the owner of a property that would later be associated with the legal case. Chambers formed Annetta Development Corporation (Annetta) on April 9, 1997, deeded the property to Annetta, and then Annetta, as the property owner, entered into a Development Agreement with Aledo Construction, Inc. (Aledo), identified as the developer. The property was intended to be laid out and sold to homebuilders. 

On April 22, 1998, Sean Knight Custom Homes, Inc. (Custom Homes) entered into a contract with Annetta to purchase Lot 26 of Phase 7 of the property. Subsequently, a warranty deed to Knight from Annetta was executed on June 15. The lot was then conveyed to Rick Bloomfield, who later transferred the lot on November 17, 1998, to his father, Richard A. Bloomfield, Sr., the lot's owner at the time of the incident under litigation. 

The incident in question occurred on April 5, 1999, when Melvin Walcott, while clearing the lot in preparation for construction, ruptured Seaway's pressurized pipeline with a backhoe tractor. Before this incident, Rick Bloomfield, with a power of attorney from his father, was supposed to close the sale of the lot to the prospective homeowners, the McWeeneys; however, the closing had to be rescheduled due to issues encountered by the McWeeneys. The McWeeneys had also hired Sean Knight, owner of Custom Homes and Bloomfield, Sr.'s son-in-law, to build a house on the lot. However, the sale had not yet closed when the accident occurred.

Following the rupture, various claims were brought against Seaway, ARCO, Knight, Custom Homes, Walcott, and others involved in the development and sale of the subdivision lot, including Doyle Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta by adjoining lot owners Tim and Ashley McAuliffe. Seaway asserted cross-claims against the existing defendants, added third-party defendants, including Bloomfield, Sr., and settled with the McAuliffes. Seaway's cross-claims and third-party claims were the only matters left in this cause.

Among other claims, Seaway alleged that Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta were negligent in several ways including in platting the lot such that the pipeline crossed the front, mislocating the pipeline easement on the recorded plat, publicizing a sales map without reference to the pipeline, and failing to warn of the presence of the pipeline. Seaway claimed that Knight and Walcott were agents of Bloomfield, Sr., and that a joint enterprise was engaged with regard to the development and sale of the lot. Seaway also argued that Bloomfield, Sr., directly and through Knight and Walcott, failed to notify Seaway that excavation was to be conducted on the lot, as required by Texas law, and was liable under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act.

The trial court granted summary judgments in favor of the appellees, striking some of Seaway's evidence, including an affidavit that contained conclusory statements, and ruled that no joint enterprise existed between Bloomfield, Sr. and Knight.","In analyzing the verdict, the court would likely consider the presented facts and determine whether the appellees owed a duty to Seaway and whether any such duty was breached, resulting in the pipeline rupture. Looking at the negligence claims, the court would examine the relationship between Bloomfield, Sr., Knight, and Walcott to determine if a joint enterprise existed or if Walcott acted as Bloomfield Sr.'s agent, employee, or independent contractor. From the details provided, it appears there was insufficient evidence to establish a joint enterprise or an agency relationship that would impute Walcott's actions to Bloomfield, Sr.

Concerning Bloomfield, Sr.'s knowledge of the excavation, the court would likely deduce that there was no evidence presented that he was aware of the planned excavation, nor did he have a legal duty to notify Seaway as required by the Texas Utilities Code. Additionally, the court would assess whether Bloomfield, Sr.'s property constituted a ""solid waste facility"" under the Texas Health and Safety Code, which would likely result in a finding that it did not, as the presence of the pipeline easement alone would not render the property a waste facility according to the law's definitions.

Addressing the negligence claims against Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta, the court would analyze the connection between the platting of the lot and the causation of the pipeline rupture. The verdict would hinge on the lack of evidence demonstrating that the lot's configuration was a substantial factor in causing the rupture or that it was foreseeable to the appellees that such a rupture would occur due to their actions, including the alleged mislocating of the pipeline easement and omission of the pipeline on the sales map.

In summary, the court would affirm the summary judgment in favor of the property owners and developers based on an analysis of the detailed facts presented, which tended to show a lack of duty, breach, and proximate cause with regard to the claims made by Seaway against the appellees."
"A Texas widow, Mrs. Bessie McVeigh, filed a lawsuit against International Travelers Assurance Company seeking to recover benefits under an accidental death policy for her husband, Townsend A. McVeigh, who had passed away. According to the widow's account, her husband sustained serious injuries as a result of an accidental fall in the bathroom of his home on April 17, 1932, suffering injuries to his abdomen, organs within the abdominal cavity, and his spine. The injuries led to a ruptured appendix and subsequent peritonitis, causing his death on May 4, 1932. The insurance policy in question was against ""loss resulting from bodily injuries effected directly, independently and exclusively, of all other causes through accidental means.""

However, the insurance company opposed the claim, citing a peremptory instruction requested at the end of the widow's evidence. This was based on the discrepancy that the company named in the policy was different than the one the widow filed against. The trial court granted the company's motion and ordered that the widow take nothing. Additionally, the widow's evidence was challenged for failing to prove that the fall was the direct, independent, and exclusive cause of her husband's death. The trial court ruling emphasized the potential for a ""fatal variance"" between allegation and proof, mainly because the named entity in the policy, attached as an exhibit to the widow's petition, was the International Travelers Association, not the International Travelers Assurance Company.

During the trial, the widow and several witnesses testified about the circumstances of the fall, Mr. McVeigh's prior good health, and the immediate decline after his injuries. Medical experts provided differing views on whether the fall could have caused or aggravated the appendix condition leading to Mr. McVeigh's death. Opinions varied on whether pressure from the fall could cause such an injury, the possible existence of a chronic condition in the appendix prior to the fall, and the direct correlation between the fall and the ruptured appendix. The case was appealed, challenging the trial court's verdict.","Upon appeal, a justice held that the lower court erred in its ruling regarding the variance based on the name discrepancy between the insurance entities. The appellate court reasoned that the insurance company did not file a plea of non est factum, which would question the validity of the contract based on the naming issue. Furthermore, because the insurance company admitted its obligation to assume the contract in its pleas, it could not effectively contest the policy's validity. 

The court also found that Mr. McVeigh's health before the fall and the direct, severe impact following the fall raised a genuine issue for deliberation. This evidence supported that Mr. McVeigh was in reasonably good health prior to the incident, and his health significantly deteriorated post-injury. Legal principles favored interpreting the clause in a manner favorable to the insured unless the accident could be considered the proximate cause of death, irrespective of any existing disease. 

Further, the court held that a reviewing court must disregard any conflicts in the evidence and focus only on the evidence supporting the existence of the facts being contested in favor of the party whose evidence was being challenged. In this light, the experts' varied testimony still presented a sufficient basis that the accident may have been the direct and proximate cause of Mr. McVeigh's demise. 

Taken together, the court decided that the evidence presented a legally sufficient case to be adjudicated by a jury, rather than being dismissed through a directed verdict. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, effectively suggesting that a trial should be conducted where the jury would decide on the cause of Mr. McVeigh's death in relation to the accidental fall and its coverage under the accidental death policy. The insurance company's motion for rehearing was overruled, upholding the decision for a new trial."
"Minnie Alston had cataract surgery in 1978 that resulted in the removal of her natural lenses, compromising her peripheral vision. Lens implantation was not available at that time. In April 1996, Alston, 59, sought secondary implantation of intraocular lenses in both eyes from Dr. Thomas Marvelli, a board-certified ophthalmologist specializing in lens implant procedures. He informed her of the risks including blindness and loss of the eye, and offered alternative options, but she chose the surgery.

On May 6, 1996, Dr. Marvelli performed the secondary anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation procedure on Alston's right eye using a ""superior"" incision at the top of the eye. The same procedure was done on her left eye in August 1996. Six months later, Alston developed complications in her right eye, which led to a series of additional surgeries conducted by Dr. Marvelli. Despite initially successful results after each surgery, repeated dislocations of the lens occurred, which Dr. Marvelli attributed to Alston rubbing her eyes, and a history of drinking and smoking.

Alston's right eye experiences included a tilted lens, tearing of the iris tissue, dislocation through an iridectomy opening, and a diagnosis of a wound leak with epithelial downgrowth which is when skin cells grow into the eye and can destroy it. Attempts to save the eye by other specialists failed, and her right eye had to be removed and replaced with a prosthetic on January 9, 1999. 

Dr. Marvelli’s repeated surgeries went through the same incision site or slightly different ones, with his technique being questioned by Alston's expert witness, Dr. Norman Jaffe, as breaching the standard of care. Dr. Jaffe opined that a horizontal, rather than vertical, placement of the haptics loops on the implant, entering from the side and not from the top, would have reduced the chance of dislocation of the lens, which he believed led to the multiple surgeries and the eventual loss of Alston's eye. 

The case proceeded to a jury trial, and the jury concluded both Alston's and Dr. Marvelli's negligence were a proximate cause of the loss of her right eye, assigning 75% responsibility to Dr. Marvelli and 25% to Alston. They awarded her $100,000 for past damages and $850,000 for future damages. 

Dr. Marvelli appealed, arguing that the expert's testimonies were based on incorrect assumptions, that Dr. Jaffe’s testimonies were scientifically unreliable, improperly based on a ""loss of chance"" doctrine not recognized in Texas, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the award for future damages.","The appeal court framed its reasoning, assuming that Dr. Marvelli's first three issues, asserting that Dr. Jaffe's expert opinion testimony was not probative evidence of causation, would be overruled. Considering Texas law, the court would find that while Dr. Jaffe's testimony occasionally referenced ""chance,"" the substance of his testimony argued a ""series of probabilities"" that sufficiently established causation under a ""reasonable medical probability."" The court would determine that his opinions did not invoke the loss of chance doctrine because the record wouldn't show a preexisting condition in Alston making the ultimate harm improbable before any negligence by Dr. Marvelli. Thus, his opinion would be deemed legally sufficient to establish cause-in-fact. 

On the assertion that Dr. Jaffe's opinions constituted no more than ipse dixit, the court would consider Dr. Jaffe's extensive qualifications, peer-reviewed publications, and authoritative textbooks on the subject, ultimately determining that his opinions were based on a reliable scientific basis that rose above mere conjecture or speculation.

For Dr. Marvelli's ninth issue, concerning the future damages awarded, the court would hold the jury's determination as not excessive. It would emphasize that the judgment was within the realm of the jury's broad discretion for personal injury damages, given the evidence showing Alston's ongoing pain, disfigurement, embarrassment from her prosthetic eye, and that she would likely continue to experience these issues permanently.

Regarding the new trial motion based on the threats allegation and newly discovered evidence, like testimony from Beverly, Amanda, and Tima, the court would find no merit in Dr. Marvelli's contentions. The pretrial knowledge of Beverly Siefkas would mean due diligence was not exercised to bring forth her testimony earlier. As to Amanda Siefkas and Tima Wyatt, the testimony would be judged as cumulative and unlikely to produce a different result, thereby not meeting the requirements for granting a new trial based on new evidence. The alleged threats would not change this assessment because it would not be apparent that the exclusion of these testimonies was erroneous or had materially affected the trial's outcome.

Overall, the appellate court would affirm the judgment of the trial court, dismissing Dr. Marvelli's assertions of error and supporting the original jury verdict for future physical and mental suffering."
"Lois Stice, the appellant beneficiary, filed an action to recover benefits under her deceased husband's accidental death insurance policy. The insurer of the policy was Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (Connecticut General) and it was offered through Stice's employer, American National Life Insurance Company (American National). Stice's husband suffered an accidental fall leading to a fractured hip and subsequent complications. While hospitalized, he developed a wound infection, and his liver functions began to deteriorate due to his pre-existing condition of chronic cirrhosis of the liver, culminating in his death. 

The issues hinged on whether Mr. Stice’s accidental bodily injury was the sole proximate cause of his death and whether his pre-existing liver disease, cirrhosis, materially contributed to it. The jury answered in favor of Mrs. Stice, finding that the accidental injury was the sole proximate cause and that cirrhosis was neither the proximate nor a contributing cause. The trial court awarded $50,000 in death benefits, a statutory penalty, interest, and attorneys' fees against Connecticut General. Additionally, the trial court entered judgment for treble damages and attorneys' fees against American National for deceptive insurance practices, as it was argued that they misrepresented the policy exclusions in a brochure.

Connecticut General contended there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the jury's findings and that Mr. Stice’s death was excluded from coverage according to the policy's terms because it resulted from disease. American National challenged the judgment on the basis that Mrs. Stice sustained no damages from their representations as she recovered under the policy due to the trial court's judgment. Both insurance companies appealed the decision.","The court will likely affirm the judgment against Connecticut General. The evidence presented at trial supported the jury's determination that accidental injury was the sole proximate cause of death and cirrhosis did not materially contribute to it. Considering the testimonies and medical records, the jury's conclusion that the pre-existing liver disease was not a proximate or contributing cause of death does not appear to be against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. As such, the exclusionary clause invoked by Connecticut General, which states that no benefits would be payable if the death was caused or contributed to by a disease, is not applicable because the jury found that the disease did not play a significant role. Therefore, Mrs. Stice's right to recover is not defeated by this policy exclusion.

Regarding the judgment against American National, the court will reverse the decision and render a take-nothing judgment in their favor. The reasoning behind this is that Mrs. Stice claimed damages based on the misrepresentation of policy exclusions. However, since the jury found that her husband's death was indeed covered under the policy and she recovered the benefits due, she did not sustain actual damages as a result of American National's conduct. The damage she initially claimed was based on the denial of the policy benefits, and because she ultimately received those benefits, she lacks compensable damages stemming from the alleged deceptive practices. Thus, American National will not be held liable for treble damages and attorneys' fees as awarded by the trial court."
"In 1982, Allan J. Fox's wife, Carol H. Fox, underwent a gynecological surgery to facilitate conception at Memorial City Medical Center, during which she received two units of blood. The first unit was ordered by the anesthesiologist, Dr. Girgis, and the second by Carol's doctor, Dr. Estrada. Following her recovery, Carol's last visit to Dr. Estrada was in November 1982.

On June 15, 1984, Carol gave birth to Megan Fox. In 1990, Carol became ill, was hospitalized, and tested positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Allan and Megan were subsequently tested, with Allan testing negative and Megan testing positive for the virus. On Christmas Day in 1991, Carol passed away due to complications related to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Megan also succumbed to AIDS-related complications on June 3, 1996.

Allan J. Fox filed a medical malpractice suit against the hospital, Dr. Girgis, and later amended it to include Dr. Estrada, alleging negligence in ordering the blood transfusion for Carol that he contended led to the HIV infections and the deaths of Carol and Megan.

On January 10, 1997, Dr. Estrada moved for summary judgment, asserting that the statute of limitations had expired, and there was no legal duty or proximate cause to find in Allan's favor. The trial court granted summary judgment for Dr. Estrada on May 16, 1997, severing his part of the case from the rest, and rendering a final judgment in his favor.

Allan appealed the summary judgment, claiming the trial court erred in ruling on several points, namely:
(1) Dr. Estrada owed no duty to Megan,
(2) Dr. Estrada's alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of Megan's HIV infection,
(3) Texas does not recognize preconception torts,
(4) the statute of limitations barred all claims by Allan, individually and on behalf of both Carol and Megan.

During the appeal, evidence highlighted that in 1982, the transmission of HIV through blood transfusion was not foreseeable within the medical community because the virus and the disease had not been identified at the time of Carol's transfusion.","The court affirmed the summary judgment for Dr. Estrada, predicting that the appellant, Allan J. Fox's claims would fail because there was no foreseeable proximate cause or legal duty present at the time of Carol's transfusion in 1982. The court would rule that foreseeability is determined not by hindsight but based on whether a person of ordinary intelligence could have anticipated the danger at the time of the negligent act. Since HIV was unknown and its transmission via blood transfusion was unforeseeable in 1982, it would be ruled that Dr. Estrada could not have anticipated the risk of HIV/AIDS exposure for Carol or her yet-to-be-conceived child, Megan.

The court would note the distinction between the blood-borne pathogens known in 1982 and HIV/AIDS, underscoring that the known pathogens were treatable, rarely fatal, and did not present comparable danger. In light of this, the court would not place an obligation to foresee the HIV/AIDS risk on Dr. Estrada or the medical community. 

The question of foreseeability for Megan would be dismissed since Estada could not have known Carol would be exposed to HIV. Imposing such knowledge and liability upon Estrada for an unknowable consequence would unfairly require the medical community to act as insurers, which the court would reject.

The court's opinion would be that a claimant cannot premise liability on the anticipation of unknown risks, rejecting any argument that the medical community should have foreseen the transmission of a then-unknown blood-borne disease like HIV through a blood transfusion.

Since the judgment may be affirmed on any meritorious theory presented in the motion for summary judgment, and the foreseeability analysis for Carol also applies to Megan, the court would rule that the remaining points of error brought forth by Allan J. Fox do not alter the outcome of the summary judgment. Therefore, the verdict would support the trial court and maintain the judgment in favor of Dr. Estrada."
"The appellant, an insurance company, contested a ruling in favor of the appellee, the insured homeowner, regarding a claim for a damaged refrigerator under a Texas Standard Homeowner's insurance policy, which covered ""loss by lightning"" but excluded loss caused by rot, among other things. The appellee's refrigerator stopped functioning while he was away from home for 12 days, and as a result, the food inside rotted, resulting in damage to the refrigerator. When the appellee returned home, he discovered that the breaker switches for all 10 separate electrical circuits in his residence were in the ""off"" position, indicating an external surge of electricity had caused them to trip.

An electrical engineer (the plaintiff) stated that an exterior surge of electricity was needed to trip all the circuit breakers, suggesting that lightning could be the only cause. In addition, there was corroborating testimony from a power company employee, who stated that during the appellee's absence there were several severe electrical storms in the area and that the power company's equipment showed signs of lightning strikes and power interruptions due to severe weather. Other evidence included similar damage to electrical systems in the neighborhood due to the storms, as well as testimony from the appellee's son about concurrent damage during the storm.

The insurer argued that because the refrigerator was damaged by rotting food, which was an excluded peril, the lightning could not be considered the proximate cause of the loss. They contended that the loss was due to deterioration, which was not covered by the policy. Their stance was essentially that the lightning was a remote cause of the damage and thus did not trigger coverage under the policy.","The verdict favored the appellee, upholding the judgment that granted him coverage for the loss of the refrigerator due to lightning under the Texas Standard Homeowner's insurance policy. The court's rationale was based on the evidence of probative force suggesting that lightning was indeed the dominant, efficient, and moving cause of the refrigerator's loss. According to the evidence presented, the lightning set off subsequent incidental, resulting, and consequential processes (like the food rotting), which in a natural and continuous sequence led to the refrigerator's damage. The court will find that the rotting food was not an independent intervening cause of the damage but merely an intermediate step in the chain of causation initiated by the lightning strike.

The court, in predicting this verdict, will likely rely on precedents that establish liability for all known effects of lightning as a direct and natural consequence of the lightning itself, regardless of other incidental agencies contributing to the loss or damage. Since the evidence demonstrates that the lightning indirectly caused all 10 circuit breakers to trip, which in turn caused the refrigerator to shut down and the food to rot, the damage to the refrigerator is a direct and natural consequence of the lightning, and thus the insurer is liable for the loss. The court will also conclude that while the lightning did not strike any part of the house or the refrigerator directly, it was still the proximate cause of the loss and not merely a remote cause. Therefore, the policy did insure against the loss, and the appellee is entitled to coverage for the damage to the refrigerator."
"Baty & Associates Insurance Agency, Inc. (BAI) is an independent insurance agency in Texas where Rick D. Baty is the president and part owner. The company employed Connie Suzanne Malliaros and Treva C. Neill as sales representatives, who later became officers and shareholders, each purchasing ten percent of BAI stock in April 1993. They were bound by a Shareholders' Agreement containing covenants not to compete.

In 1994, Malliaros and Neill began planning to start their own insurance agency, ProTech. They resigned from BAI and commenced business the next day. ProTech obtained agency appointments with four insurers, also represented by BAI. After resigning, Malliaros and Neill faced a lawsuit from BAI seeking to enforce the covenants not to compete, among other claims. Eventually, the parties reached a settlement, rescinding the Shareholders' Agreement. As part of the settlement, claims were dismissed without prejudice, and Baty and BAI released Malliaros, Neill, and ProTech from any claims relating to non-compete and non-solicitation obligations.

Despite the settlement agreement, Baty and BAI filed a second lawsuit against Malliaros, Neill, ProTech, and four insurance companies (Aetna, Hartford, AMS, and Fidelity). BAI alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and accused the insurance companies of tortius interference with existing contracts, prospective business relationships, inducing breaches of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of all appellees, leading to this appeal.

The appellate court had to determine whether the settlement agreement effectively released the tort claims and whether the insurance companies lawfully granted agency appointments to Malliaros, Neill, and ProTech.","The trial court's judgment of dismissing BAI's tort claims against Malliaros, Neill, and ProTech was reversed, as it's ruled that the Settlement and Rescission Agreement did not release these tort claims due to the absence of language expressly releasing them. It will be predicted that the court will find that specific claims not identified in the settlement agreement were not intended to be included and thus were not extinguished.

The trial court's summary judgment in favor of Hartford on BAI's interference with prospective business relationships will be reversed. Based on the Texas Supreme Court's ruling in Sturges, the verdict will focus on the requirement that the plaintiff show the defendant's conduct was independently tortious, absent evidence of Hartford's intentional and unlawful interference.

However, the trial court's judgment in favor of Aetna, AMS, and Fidelity concerning BAI's claim for tortious interference with existing contracts and prospective business relationships will be affirmed. It will be reasoned that these insurance companies were performing acts they were contractually obliged to do by granting agency appointments and therefore were legally justified, emphasizing that entering into a contract does not equate to inducing or intentionally causing breach or interference.

Lastly, BAI's civil conspiracy claims will most likely not succeed against the insurance companies because conspiracy is a derivative tort requiring an underlying tort for liability. Since the trial court granted summary judgment for most of the underlying torts, there is no basis for conspiracy, leading to affirmation of these judgments.

Therefore, while the judgment against the employees will be reversed and remanded, the judgment against the insurance companies with respect to tortious interference and civil conspiracy will likely be affirmed, barring a successful appeal regarding Hartford's interference with prospective business relationships."
"Debbie Kay Crocker, aged 44, suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was admitted to the Rembrandt Center, a nursing home, in a semi-comatose state. Crocker was later hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory distress. She was subsequently discharged from the hospital and transferred to another nursing facility. Nine months after being discharged from the Rembrandt Center, Crocker died on January 18, 1998.

The appellants, Crocker's family (Johnny R. Crocker individually and as representative of the Estate of Debbie Kay Crocker, Robby Joe Crocker, Billy Jack Crocker, and Billie Smith) sued the Rembrandt Center for negligence and gross negligence in the Probate Court No. 3, Dallas County (Texas). They claimed the center did not provide adequate nursing care as they failed to give her adequate oxygen and monitor her blood sugar, leading to severe respiratory distress, hyperglycemia, and consequently her death. The Rembrandt Center filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, asserting that the Crocker family had no evidence to prove that any act or omission of the defendant caused any injury to Debbie Kay Crocker.

In response to the no-evidence summary judgment motion, the appellants provided evidence of various acts of negligence, including declarations from nurses and Crocker's medical records. They faced challenges regarding the qualification of their expert witnesses (nurses) to testify on the proximate cause of Crocker's death. The trial court granted the Rembrandt Center's motion for summary judgment, which led to the Crocker family appealing, stating that the summary judgment in favor of the Rembrandt Center was incorrect.","The appellate court upheld the judgment of the trial court, affirming the summary judgment in favor of the Rembrandt Center. The court will determine that the appellants did not raise a genuine issue of material fact on the challenged proximate cause element of their negligence claim. The reasoning for this decision will focus on:

1. Whether the Rembrandt Center's no-evidence motion for summary judgment was legally sufficient. The court will find that the motion sufficiently challenged the proximate cause element of the appellants' action, and that any lack of specificity did not warrant an objection from the appellants, hence not affecting the motion's legal sufficiency.

2. The challenge to the proximate cause evidence presented by the appellants, where the trial court will be found to have not abused its discretion in sustaining objections to it. The appellate court will rule that the appellants indeed needed to provide expert testimony to prove causation of the specific injuries alleged. 

3. The court will find that the appellants failed to establish that their nurse experts were qualified to provide expert opinion testimony specifically on the proximate cause of Crocker's claimed injuries, which included respiratory distress, hyperglycemia, and death. Since the appellants were not able to demonstrate the qualifications necessary to establish a link between the Rembrandt Center's alleged negligence and the specific injuries claimed, their evidence will not be deemed sufficient to raise a fact question on proximate cause.

4. Finally, the court will conclude that even without the stricken expert testimony, the appellants did not present more than a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause of Crocker's injuries. The non-expert evidence cited by the appellants, such as the TDHS records, will be found to not adequately establish the necessary causal link.

Based on these findings, the appellate court will predictably affirm the trial court's judgment, thereby determining that the appellants did not meet their burden in opposing the Rembrandt Center's no-evidence motion for summary judgment."
"The case involves a cattleman who has a prearranged agreement with a railway company to ship his cattle from Merkel to Waxahachie, Texas. On November 25, 1892, the cattleman penned approximately 100 head of cattle in the railway company’s stock pens, which were provided for that purpose. However, the gate to one of the pens was defective due to negligent maintenance by the railway company—a fact the company knew of but had not rectified for months. While attempting to secure the gate with a rope to prevent the cattle from escaping, a passing freight train spooked the animals into a panic. The cattle rushed the gate, resulting in it giving way and hurling the cattleman around twenty feet onto the ground, rendering him unconscious due to the impact.

In his lawsuit against the railway company, the cattleman sought damages for two claims: personal injuries sustained in the incident and damages to his cattle due to the defective gate of the stock pen. Within the legal proceedings, demurrers were filed, contesting that the injuries could not be proximately caused by the company's negligence. Despite this, the cattleman was successful at trial, attaining a favorable judgment for both claims of action, which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.","Considering the existing legal principles and precedents, the verdict will likely differentiate between the claim of personal injuries and the claim regarding the injuries to the cattle. 

For the personal injury claim, the court will probably conclude that the railway company's negligence was not the proximate cause of the cattleman's injuries. Although the cattleman would not have been injured but for the defective gate latch, the immediate cause of his injuries was the independent event of the cattle being spooked by the freight train, which is an event the railway company could not have reasonably foreseen. In this instance, the occurrence of the freight train passing and the panic-induced stampede of the cattle represents an unforeseeable, intervening cause that legally disconnects the railway company’s negligence from the personal injuries sustained by the cattleman. The active cause of the personal injury was detached from the company's negligent maintenance of the gate, which means that the company's actions cannot be held as the proximate cause of the personal injury and, as such, do not give rise to a legal claim for those personal injuries.

On the other hand, the injuries to the cattle fall within the scope of foreseeable risks associated with the defective latch on the pen's gate—a condition that the company was aware of and neglected to repair. The railway company had an implied duty to safely contain the cattle, and it should have anticipated the possibility that the cattle might escape due to the defective latch and thereby cause loss to the cattleman. Furthermore, the railway company's liability as a common carrier had already attached when it took possession of the cattle for transport. Because it was within the realm of reasonable anticipation that the cattle could escape and cause economic harm, the court is likely to uphold the cattleman's claim for damages in relation to the cattle injuries.

Overall, the court will possibly reverse the trial court judgment on the personal injury claim due to the lack of proximate cause, while affirming the decision regarding the cattle's injuries, sending the case back for further proceedings consistent with the separation of these two claims."
"Arthur B. Lee, an employee at Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. from 1964 to 1972, filed a lawsuit after becoming unable to work in 1985 due to silicosis, a debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling airborne silica particles. The disease is recognized as work-related, and his exposure occurred during his employment at Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. Lee's injuries were covered by workers' compensation insurance under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.

Lee filed suit against the manufacturer, Dresser Industries, Inc. (referred to as Dresser or appellant), on three legal theories of liability: strict liability, negligence, and breach of implied warranty. The case was tried solely on the strict liability claim. The jury found that Dresser's failure to warn about silica's dangers made the product unreasonably dangerous as marketed. The jury concluded this failure was a producing cause of Lee's silicosis, attributing 96% of the disease to Dresser's product and 4% to a product from the settling tortfeasor, Pennsylvania Glass-Sand Corporation.

The trial court signed and entered a judgment favoring Lee, awarding substantial damages. Dresser appealed, raising five points of error, arguing the trial court erred by refusing to submit its requested definitions and negligence-related questions, excluding relevant testimony, and by not giving the sole cause instruction to the jury.","The appellate court affirmed the lower court's judgment in favor of Lee. The reasoning for the verdict included that Dresser's requested question about Lee's negligence was not in a legally acceptable form, and there was no provision for a limiting instruction to prevent the jury from considering Lee's negligence relating solely to his failure to discover or guard against the danger.

Additionally, the court concluded that it was not legally permissible to consider the negligence of Lee's employer, Tyler Pipe, for the purpose of reducing Lee's recoverable damages in a suit against Dresser, a negligent third-party. This conclusion is in line with the principle established in Varela v. American Petrofina Co. which prevents the consideration of an employer's negligence in calculating damages in an employee's lawsuit against a negligent third-party.

The court also found no error in the trial court's exclusion of evidence regarding Tyler Pipe's conduct or in the denial of the sole cause instruction, reiterating that such considerations are prohibited by Varela.

Thus, the appellate court's judgment was based on the premise that the legal instructions and the limitations on permissible considerations regarding negligence were consistent with the precedents set by the Texas Supreme Court and statutory provisions. Consequently, Dresser's points of error were overruled, the strict liability judgment favoring Lee was affirmed, and all costs of the appeal were adjudged against Dresser."
"The appellant, as the sole heir of the decedent Mrs. Hernandez's estate, appealed a directed verdict granted by the 49th District Court of Webb County, Texas, in favor of the appellee physicians and their professional association in a medical malpractice case. Mrs. Hernandez suffered a heart attack and was treated by the appellees, during which a metal guide wire used to place a catheter was accidentally left in her heart. This error was discovered the next day through an X-ray, and, while all five defendant doctors were aware, the patient and her family were not informed. Instead, false information about the need for another operation was given as a pretext to remove the wire. The second procedure did remove the wire but also included actions that covered up the initial mistake. Mrs. Hernandez died on June 8th, having never been informed of the guide wire or its removal operation. After her death, the family learned of the error through an anonymous letter. There was no autopsy performed, and the wire was destroyed by one of the doctors. At trial, the appellant presented expert testimony from Dr. Ronald Katz, suggesting that the delay in removing the guide wire could have caused a fatal blood clot. The trial court instructed a verdict in favor of the appellees, accepting their argument that the appellant had not presented probative evidence linking the guide wire to a blood clot and the clot to the death of Mrs. Hernandez.","The court will reverse the directed verdict based upon the assertion that sufficient evidence was presented to raise a jury question concerning both negligence on the part of the appellee physicians and the proximate cause of Mrs. Hernandez’s death. The appellant successfully showed, through expert testimony, that the actions of the appellees were medically linked to the death of Mrs. Hernandez. The expert witness, Dr. Katz, testified that blood clots could easily form on metal guide wires like the one left in Mrs. Hernandez's heart, and that, based on reasonable medical probability, such a clot formed and caused her death. The court will determine that Dr. Katz's lack of specialization in hematology does not preclude his qualifications to testify about the negligence and proximate cause, given that he is a medical doctor and had pertinent knowledge related to the issue. Moreover, the court will find appellees' argument that there were other possible causes of death insufficient to negate the evidence presented since the expert established that the probability of death from the blood clot was higher than all other potential causes combined. The court will consider that the lack of an autopsy and the destruction of the wire by the appellees should not benefit them, stating a party cannot destroy evidence and then complain about a lack of proof. The court will also find that there are factual underpinnings to support the expert's reasonable medical probability findings, specifically in the presentation of general medical principles that enable the jury to infer causation. Therefore, the court will conclude that the evidence was adequate to entitle the appellant to have a jury determine issues of negligence and proximate cause, making the directed verdict improper. The judgment against the appellant will be reversed and remanded for trial, as the appellant is entitled to have these factual disagreements evaluated by a jury.

"Appellee Robert Barrera, an employee of Tri-State Wholesale Associated Grocers, Inc. (appellant employer), suffered injuries resulting from a workplace accident. On August 15, 1990, another Tri-State employee, Louis Calderon, while operating a forklift in the freezer section of Warehouse B, lost control of the vehicle on an accumulated sheet of ice and became trapped after crashing into merchandise racks. Barrera, hearing Calderon's cries for help, attempted to rescue him by clearing merchandise, which allowed Calderon to free himself.

Calderon, fearing further accidents because of the forklift's proximity to the obscured freezer door and the possibility of another vehicle entering, requested Barrera to move the forklift. While attempting this, Barrera activated the forklift, which moved in reverse and pinned him against the rack, causing injuries including a herniated disc and impairment to his work capacity.

Barrera filed a lawsuit against Tri-State, claiming negligence. The jury found Tri-State liable, as they had permitted ice to accumulate, creating hazardous working conditions. Furthermore, they ruled the actions of Barrera, as a rescuer, were foreseeable consequences of the original negligence. On appeal, the appellant argued that there was insufficiency of evidence to prove negligence, and that the rescue attempt by a third party (Barrera) was an unforeseeable intervening cause, absolving them of liability. Furthermore, Tri-State claimed the trial court erred by excluding evidence that was intended for impeachment regarding Barrera's work proficiency post-accident. The performance report in question would have potentially refuted Barrera's claims about his reduced work capability.","The appellate court upheld the judgment against the appellant and provided reasoning that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to establish Tri-State's negligence. The accumulation of ice within the facility was a known hazard, Tri-State admitted knowledge of frequent ice formation near the freezer doors, and failed to regularly mitigate this risk. This contributed to the incident which was the proximate cause of Barrera's injuries. The court rejected the argument that the third party's (Barrera's) rescue attempt broke the chain of causality, noting that actions of rescuers are typically foreseeable outcomes of the initial negligent act. In the specific situation, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Barrera's actions were a direct and foreseeable result of the conditions created by Tri-State's negligence.

Additionally, the exclusion of the impeachment evidence was upheld because Tri-State failed to produce the performance report in response to Barrera's discovery request. This was mandatory under the rules governing discovery, which state that withheld items need to be supplemented when obtained. The exclusion was automatic for Tri-State's failure to comply, and the court emphasized that the rule's implementation is mandatory with exclusion as the sole sanction.

In conclusion, the appellate court supported the jury's findings on all counts, affirming Tri-State's liability for negligence and maintaining that the excluded evidence remained invalid due to procedural non-compliance."
"D.B., a premature infant, was born on May 19, 2005, at Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. At birth, she weighed 600 grams (1.32 pounds) and had a gestational age between 23 weeks and 1 day and 24 weeks. Due to her severe prematurity, D.B. had a 90-100% chance of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding retinal disorder. Unfortunately, D.B. suffered total blindness in her right eye and severe vision impairment in her left eye as a result of ROP.

D.B.’s parents, the Bustamantes, filed a lawsuit against Del Sol Medical Center, Enrique N. Ponte Jr., M.D. (neonatologist and NICU medical director), and Jorge Fabio Llamas-Soforo, M.D. (ophthalmologist), claiming their negligence resulted in D.B.'s vision loss. Del Sol settled before trial, and a jury trial proceeded against Dr. Ponte and Dr. Llamas.

Dr. Ponte testified he requested an ""early"" examination of D.B.'s eyes by Dr. Llamas, who first examined D.B.'s eyes on July 4, 2005, noting ""incomplete vascularization in zone II of the retina"" although due to a transcription error, the records indicated ""complete vascularization."" Dr. Llamas scheduled a follow-up in four weeks, ignoring the 2001 Statement regarding ROP screening, which dictated closer follow-up intervals given D.B.'s situation.

On August 1, Dr. Llamas diagnosed that ROP had developed significantly and recommended immediate laser therapy, which was delayed for three more days. Despite the treatment, D.B.'s right retina detached, causing permanent blindness. In her left eye, she has severe visual impairment demanding her to hold items close even with glasses.

Competing expert witnesses testified on whether the doctors’ negligence was the proximate cause of D.B.'s impaired vision. Dr. Good and Dr. Phelps, experts for the Bustamantes, opined the untimely diagnosis and treatment were substantial factors in D.B.'s outcomes. Dr. Good believed that with proper exam schedule adherence, treatment could have occurred earlier, thus averting the severe results.

After the trial, the jury found Dr. Ponte 45% responsible and Dr. Llamas 45% responsible for D.B.’s injuries, awarding total damages of over $2.1 million. The non-settling defendants appealed, arguing the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's findings, and the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of causation, as the experts' testimonies did not establish a ""but-for"" cause of D.B.'s injuries.","The Supreme Court of Texas will reverse the court of appeals’ judgment regarding Dr. Ponte and his professional association and remand the case for further consideration due to errors made by the lower court. The Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding of negligence on the part of Dr. Ponte, emphasizing that the substantial-factor test, rather than a strict but-for causation standard, should have been applied in assessing the combined negligence leading to D.B.’s poor visual outcome.

The Court will determine that rejecting the statistical evidence premised on the ETROP study was an error and that Dr. Good's and Dr. Phelps's expert opinions were indeed based on substantial evidence and were not merely conclusory. Both experts' testimonies, albeit imperfect, provided a rationale for their opinions and explained how earlier diagnosis and treatment could have likely changed D.B.'s prognosis. The Court will assert that the cumulative evidence from the trial demonstrated D.B.'s vision loss was more likely than not caused by the combined negligence in delaying diagnosis and treatment of her ROP. Consequently, the Court will remand the case, instructing the court of appeals to address any other outstanding issues that have not been previously examined."
"The underlying incident is a three-vehicle freeway collision that resulted in one death and serious injuries. Evelyn Lane (decedent) ran over debris and stopped her car on the freeway. Thomas Hurst (plaintiff driver) stopped his postal truck behind her. Defendant driver, operating a tractor-trailer owned by defendant corporation, subsequently hit Hurst's truck, causing it to collide with Lane's car, which led to an explosion. Both Lane and Hurst filed negligence actions against the defendant driver and corporation, seeking damages for the collision. These suits were consolidated and tried before a jury. The jury found Lane to be 30% negligent, Hurst 30% negligent, and the defendant driver 40% negligent. The trial court awarded plaintiffs 70% of the damages. The defendants appealed, claiming that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of a potential fourth vehicle's involvement. The witness, Joseph Horn, was prevented from relaying a statement from the driver of this fourth vehicle—a light-colored pickup—which could corroborate the defense's account of the accident circumstances. They also claimed the exclusion of evidence about a gasoline can in Lane's car affected the causation issue, arguing it directly contributed to the fire and Lane's death. The defendants further contended that the trial court erred in its submission of general negligence and proximate cause issues to the jury, the severance of the third-party claim, and the treatment of contributory negligence in the final judgment.","The court will likely reverse and remand for a new trial, finding errors in the trial court's handling of the excluded witness testimony and the gasoline can evidence. The testimony about the fourth vehicle's involvement, regarded as a spontaneous declaration under the hearsay exception rules, was improperly excluded, which likely prejudiced the defendants' case. The defendants should have been able to present the gasoline can as part of the causation evidence, considering its potential role in the fatality. Therefore, these exclusions probably impacted the jury's verdict. Regarding the general negligence and proximate cause issue, the court will probably recognize concerns related to the combined submission of negligence and proximate cause but may not consider these to warrant reversal due to the defendants' insufficient specificity in their trial court objections. However, a more specific submission upon retrial may be suggested to avoid ambiguity. The court will likely not find that Mrs. Lane's estate was an indispensable party since the defendants had the responsibility to include them and did not sufficiently show diligence. However, a motion to consolidate third-party action in the retrial may be given consideration. The negligence attributed to Lane in carrying a gasoline can may be deemed relevant to damages but not as a contributory negligence factor in the accident. The court will also likely address the allocation of negligence among parties and how it affects each plaintiff's award. The comparative negligence statute may be interpreted as requiring each plaintiff's recovery to be assessed separately, without considering the negligence of the other plaintiff. This arrangement avoids altering substantive rights due to procedural consolidation. The percentages of negligence may not need to total 100%, and each plaintiff’s recovery may be diminished in proportion only to their own negligence compared to the defendant's negligence. Therefore, the defendants' request to diminish plaintiffs' recovery or dismiss the case on combined negligence will likely be refuted. The court will address these and potentially other issues, setting forth a verdict that mandates a fair and legally sound retrial.

"The Texas Hotel Company of Longview (local company) operated Hotel Longview in Longview, Texas. On March 29, 1934, a fire at the hotel resulted in deaths and injuries, including the death of F.D. Jones. The plaintiffs in the case were Lasca Graham (formerly Mrs. F.D. Jones), her current husband Frank Graham, their minor son Edwin Jones (represented by a guardian), and the Maryland Casualty Company, which had paid compensation as Jones's employer's insurer. The plaintiffs filed an action to recover damages for Jones's death against both the local company and the National Hotel Company (national company), alleging negligence. The claim against the national company was that it owned and controlled the local company as a dummy corporation and was operating the hotel through this agency.

The plaintiffs argued that these companies failed to immediately call the fire department upon discovering the fire and did not warn the occupants, including Jones, which they alleged was negligence and the proximate cause of his death. The local company's defenses included a general denial of negligence, the plea of assumption of risk, and the argument that the rapid spread of the fire was the sole proximate cause of death. The national company adopted the local company's defenses and filed additional demurrers and special exceptions.

The jury found that Jones had died in the fire and that the employees of the hotel failed to promptly call the fire department and warn the occupants, determining these failures were negligent and proximately caused Jones's death. However, the jury rejected that the fire's suddenness and fierceness was the cause of death. The case against the national company was identical to an already decided case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, where the court had concluded there was no liability due to the fire's swift nature and the Supreme Court of Texas had affirmed.","In reaching a verdict, the court would analyze the previous case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, and the current case's parallelism in detail and evidence. Since the Supreme Court has already ruled on a similar case with the same defendants and has concluded that the national company was not liable because the swift nature of the fire was beyond control, it would likely lead to the dismissal of the plaintiffs' case against the national company. Consequently, the court will predictably reverse the trial court's judgment against the national company and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing in their cause of action against said company.

With regards to the local company, the court would examine the evidence regarding the hotel employees' alleged negligence in warning Jones and the delay in calling the fire department. Given the similarity in evidence to the Motley case and the recent decision in Texas Hotel Company of Longview et al. v. R. W. Cosby et al., the court would likely find that even if the employees were negligent, their actions (or inactions) were too speculative to be considered the proximate cause of Jones's death. Thus, the court would predictably reverse the trial court's judgment against the local company and remand for further proceedings, focusing on whether the negligence alleged was truly a proximate cause of death."
"W.W. Chandler, a citizen of Montague County of unsound mind, purchased a tract of land in 1907, which is traversed by Jones Creek. The Bowie Sewerage Company, a private corporation, constructed a sewage disposal plant in 1914 on a tract through which Jones Creek flows, about a mile or a mile and a half northeast of Chandler's property. The disposal plant served the town of Bowie, and the waste matter was treated in a system designed to dissolve refuse, which was then released into Jones Creek in September 1925. The creek flows onto Chandler's property approximately a mile from the discharge point. After the operation of the disposal plant, the creek on Chandler's property began to emit offensive odors and potentially harmful disease germs, causing discoloration and pollution of the creek bed. The overflow from the creek also damaged Chandler's land used for growing vegetables, adversely affecting his crops and the value of his land. A further claim was made regarding Chandler's wife's illness caused by the conditions created by the company.

Chandler's next friend filed suit on his behalf alleging the conditions constituted a nuisance, specifically a permanent one, and sought damages for the devaluation of Chandler's land and the illness suffered by Chandler's wife. During the trial, several demurrers, special exceptions, and pleas of limitations were overruled, and the jury was presented with 27 special issues to determine. The jury found in favor of Chandler on several points, including the establishment that the company's disposal plant discharge was the source of offensive odors and disease germs. They assessed the decline in the value of Chandler's property caused by the nuisances. However, the jury found against Chandler on issues relating to his wife's health and issued conflicting answers regarding the source of the disease germs. Chandler was awarded $1,470 in damages with an additional six percent interest from January 1, 1926. Following the trial, the company's motions for mistrial, refusal of judgment, and a new trial were all denied, leading to the company's appeal.","Upon reviewing the details provided in the appeal, the court will conclude that Chandler's pleadings and evidence illustrate only a temporary nuisance that could potentially be abated by the defendant, not a permanent nuisance. The judgment for damages will be considered incorrect because the measure of damages applied was based on the assumption of a permanent nuisance. The court will opine that Chandler needed to plead and prove that the company's disposal plant was unsuitable for its intended purpose or negligently operated, which was not sufficiently demonstrated.

Furthermore, the court will take judicial notice of the disposal plant's intent, which was to treat sewage and prevent it from being a nuisance. Since the burden is on Chandler to prove it is a nuisance, and the proof presented falls short, the court will not sustain the trial court’s judgment on this ground.

The court will also find fault with the lay testimony accepted regarding Chandler's mental capacity, stating that a witness can only testify about the person's mental state after establishing qualification through fact-based observations. Additionally, the court will identify inconsistencies in the jury's findings, which should preclude judgment being based on the given verdict, and will disapprove of the trial court awarding damages with interest from a prior date, as it is not an established practice.

Moreover, the court will take issue with the submission of certain special issues to the jury, particularly regarding the necessity of expert testimony to establish the presence of disease germs and the failure to define the term ""materially offensive.""

Based on these considerations, the court will reverse the judgment from the trial court and remand the cause, meaning the case will be sent back to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court’s findings."
"Richard Wynne O'Banion, Sr. (""O'Banion"") was admitted to Christus St. Mary Hospital following a heart attack. O'Banion had a medical history that included coronary artery disease, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and heart surgery. O'Banion's initial condition post-admission seemed to be improving, but during his stay, he fell while a nursing assistant helped him from the bathroom. This fall resulted in a broken right cheekbone and brain injuries, as evidenced by a CT scan that showed a complex fracture in the facial area and several small intracranial hematomas, along with encephalomalacia from previous cerebrovascular attacks. O'Banion was discharged to a nursing home, where he died a few days later.

At the trial, appellees (O'Banion's wife and children) provided testimonies from four physicians: Drs. Udonta, Croft, Smith, and Meissner. The testimonies covered various aspects, including O'Banion's prognosis following the fall, complications from brain injuries potentially contributing to his death, and the impact of the fall on his treatment and therapy likely resulting in secondary complications like pneumonia, infections, blood clots, or decubitus ulcers. Despite improvements in his condition prior to the fall, medical experts testified that the fall changed O'Banion's clinical course and that O'Banion became prone to many complications due to being bedridden and the discontinuation of Coumadin. However, there was some contradiction in the evidence on whether the fall directly caused O'Banion's death or if his existing heart condition was the actual cause. Ultimately, expert testimony did not conclusively state that the fall was the direct cause of death or identify specific complications from the fall as the cause. The case then went to appeal on the basis that this testimony provided insufficient evidence to prove proximate cause.","The appellant hospital is likely to have the judgment reversed and rendered that the appellees take nothing from the hospital based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence regarding proximate cause. To successfully uphold the jury's verdict, there needed to be legally sufficient evidence to demonstrate that O'Banion's death was a direct result of the fall, which required ruling out other potential causes. The plaintiff must prove that the negligent act or omission was a substantial factor in the harm and that without it, the harm would not have occurred. Expert testimonies did not establish this causation beyond the point of conjecture as they did not provide concrete evidence that the fall was directly responsible for O'Banion's death, only that his condition was negatively impacted following the fall. For instance, they indicated that while the fall may have altered O'Banion's prognosis and led to additional risks or complications like pneumonia or heart problems due to the altered treatment regime post-fall, no expert could rule out the possibility that O'Banion could have died from his preexisting heart condition regardless of the fall. 

Furthermore, testimonies referring to an increased mortality rate or potential contributions to the death were not precise enough to satisfy the legal requirement for proving proximate cause. Mortality rates and the loss of a chance of survival are not recognized as adequate evidence of proximate cause under Texas law. Given the other plausible causes of death not ruled out by the testimonies, such as heart failure or a cardiac event, and the inability of the experts to definitively link the fall to the death through an identified complication, it seems that the hospital's assertion regarding the legal insufficiency of evidence stands. Considering the standard that a preponderance of the evidence shows the negligent act was a substantial factor in the harm and without which the harm would not have occurred, the court is likely to find in favor of the appellant, Christus St. Mary Hospital. Consequently, the judgment in favor of the appellees will be reversed, and a judgment will be rendered that appellees take nothing from the hospital."
"Jeanette Galin, the appellant, brought a survivorship and wrongful death action against Robert Packard and his company, Banjo Distributing Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as appellees), following the death of her husband, Ronald Galin. The incident occurred on July 24, 1993, when Ronald Galin drowned while fishing on Lake Medina with Packard. Both men were not wearing life preservers while fishing, and upon Galin falling into the water, Packard attempted a rescue by extending a fishing pole, throwing a rope, and finally a flotation device; all of which failed to save Galin.

The appellant sued for negligence, alleging eight specific failures on Packard's part, including not providing or using adequate flotation devices, not maintaining control of the boat or keeping it in a safe condition, inadequate rescue attempts, failing to warn, creating a hazardous condition, and operating the boat with disregard for safety. The appellant later amended the complaint to include negligence per se claims based on alleged violations of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code.

The appellees filed a motion for summary judgment which acknowledged all of the appellant's claims but contended that these could be translated into two theories of liability: the failure to require the use of flotation devices and the failure to rescue Galin. The motion for summary judgment did not address the negligence per se claims raised in the appellant's amended petition since they were not present when the appellees filed their motion. However, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees, which was then appealed by the appellant.","The court will reverse the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. The appellate court will find that the appellees did not demonstrate entitlement to summary judgment on all the appellant's claims. Specifically, the appellees' motion failed to address the five out of eight original allegations of negligence not encompassed by their two proposed theories of liability. Consequently, the court will reason that summary judgment should not have been granted when the appellees' motion did not address each cause of action explicitly.

Additionally, the appellate court will hold that the appellees were not entitled to summary judgment on the negligence per se claims because these were added to the appellant's petition after the summary judgment motion was filed, and the appellees did not amend their motion to address these new allegations. Since the trial court's decision appeared to encompass all claims, including those not addressed in the appellees’ motion or those raised in the amendment, the court will find error in the summary judgment on this ground as well.

The appellate court will emphasize the necessity for a motion for summary judgment to expressly and completely address each cause of action claimed by the non-movant. Because several of the appellant’s negligence accusations and all of the negligence per se claims were not addressed, the appellees will fail to meet the strict standard required to grant summary judgment, leading to the reversal of the trial court's decision."
"Appellant employees Joe Garcia, Francisco Salinas, and Guadalupe Salinas were injured (or killed, in the case of Salinas) when they fell from a scaffold having a hoisting mechanism belonging to appellee manufacturer, Sky Climber, which was leased to appellant employer (Texas Concrete Silo Company). The accident occurred on July 24, 1967, while they were sealing concrete blocks on a silo using this scaffold with a hoisting mechanism for elevation. The scaffold belonged to Silo Builders, Inc., but the hoisting mechanism belonged to Sky Climber and was attached to the top of the silo by a ""sky hook."" Garcia and Salinas were on the scaffold when the wire rope unraveled, and they fell to the ground. The wire rope was relatively new, and defects such as kinks, bird-cages, or fish hooks were considered extremely dangerous as they could jam or break the rope.

The employees originally sued on theories including that the hoisting mechanism got caught and tore apart the good condition rope or that it was a strict liability theory of design defect. They suggested a fail-safe inertia type braking system could have been designed to prevent such accidents. The jury's answers were inconsistent; they found the device was not unfit for use, but the design was defective and negligently so, although not a proximate cause of the accident. The jury also found various other elements related to the use of safety belts and failure to warn of damaged cables, alongside determinations of damages for both injured and deceased employees' families.

During the trial, certain instructions that the court gave to the jury were challenged by the appellants. They contended that these instructions were not accurate for a strict liability case, were an improper general charge, and constituted a comment on the evidence, which was impermissible. There were also complaints about the testimony of a witness, Dye, regarding statements made by Kenneth Perry, the foreman, which were considered hearsay and not a declaration against interest that could be admissible. Furthermore, the appellants challenged the admissibility of the wire rope presented at trial due to questions about its chain of possession and whether it was tampered with, as well as particular special issues submitted to the jury related to proximate cause.

Appellant employer Texas Concrete Silo Company, was involved due to an indemnity clause in the lease agreement with Sky Climber, requiring them to indemnify Sky Climber for the costs in defending the suit, including attorney’s fees and court costs.","The court, in its reasoning, will affirm the judgment as to appellant employer Texas Concrete Silo Company, acknowledging the indemnity clauses within the lease agreement to hold Sky Climber harmless from any claim, which includes costs incurred in defending itself against lawsuits. The indemnity provisions are sufficiently broad and detailed, indicating appellant employer’s full liability for any loss, expense, or damage sustained by appellee. The evidence presented sustains this holding to indemnify, including a precedent that attorney's fees and court costs are typically covered under general indemnity agreements. 

Regarding appellant employees, the court is likely to reverse and remand based on the improper jury instruction given by the trial court. The instruction on the law was too general, not properly limited to strict liability issues, and could be seen to bias the jury against the appellants' case. The instruction likely prejudiced one of the parties (the appellants) and was an impermissible comment on the evidence. The trial court’s error in providing unnecessary comments directed the jury's attention too specifically, leading to informed speculation that these comments influenced the jury's conflicted resolutions. 

Additionally, the court will find that the admission of testimony considered hearsay was not justified as a prior inconsistent statement of a witness (as the witness was not confronted with the statement) nor as a declaration against interest, as there was no evidence that the declarant had authority to bind the company. 

Also, probable speculation suggests that the court will agree with the appellants that no proper chain of custody or identity was established for the wire rope presented at trial, and, as such, it should not have been admitted without confirming it was the same rope involved in the accident, and unaltered.

Furthermore, it can be predicted that the court will side with the appellants on the applicability of strict liability to the case regarding a product's defective design, following reasoning from adherent states and supported by legal precedents. This will entail validating the arguments that the product was defective and thus unreasonably dangerous to the users, warranting a reversal due to errors in jury instructions related to these points.

The result will be an intricate consideration of legal principles, errors in the initial trial, and implications of the lease agreement terms, leading to the affirmation of the employer's judgement for indemnity and a reversal and remand for the appellants (Garcia and the Salinas estate) on the basis of improperly admitted evidence, incorrect jury instructions, and the misapplication of the law regarding strict liability in defective design."
"The petitioner, horse owner John Archibald, placed his Arabian mare in the training program offered by the respondent, Act III Arabians. The mare was to be trained in an English pleasure riding style, but proved difficult to manage, often bucking when commanded to trot. During a particularly rigorous training session aimed at breaking the mare's bucking habit, one of the respondent's trainers used a riding crop extensively, causing welts on the mare. This led to abrasions and swelling, which were treated by a veterinarian. However, the mare's condition worsened as her skin began to slough off, leading to the development of founder, a disease impairing blood circulation to the hoof. Ultimately, the mare's condition became so severe that she had to be destroyed.

Archibald sued Act III Arabians, claiming damages as a result of the mare's death, based on allegations of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). The jury found that Act III Arabians did not train the mare in a good and workmanlike manner, contributing to the mare's death and assessing her fair market value at $75,000. However, the trial court rendered a judgment against Archibald, ruling that no implied warranties exist for services under Texas law. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, taking the view that horse training did not fall under the scope of implied warranties for services related to the repair or modification of existing tangible goods or property.","The case revolves around determining whether horse training services fall under the scope of an implied warranty of good and workmanlike performance. An implied warranty of this nature applies to services that involve the repair or modification of existing tangible goods or property. As a horse is defined as ""existing tangible goods"" and horse training is an activity that modifies a horse's demeanor, skills, intrinsic ability to perform, obey commands, and its market value, the court will likely find that horse training is a service that should be implicitly warranted to be of good and workmanlike performance.

Given the outcome of the previous court rulings and focusing on the Texas Supreme Court precedent in Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, the court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for consideration of further points of error that have not yet been addressed. Given that the jury found the training was not conducted in a good and workmanlike manner and contributed to the mare's death, the court will acknowledge this service rendered by the respondent fell under the scope of an implied warranty, which was breached. Therefore, the petitioner will be entitled to recover under the grounds of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of the DTPA, considering the improper training amounted to a modification of the mare's intrinsic value as an existing tangible good."
"Appellant Bradley Alan Jacobson was injured while attempting to stop the demolition of a building that was property secured by a promissory note held by the Jacobson Family Trust I. Jacobson sued Avi Ron, the appellee and owner of the building, for premises liability and general negligence. Jacobson argued that Ron failed to maintain the property, did not erect fencing, created a dangerous condition, and was liable under the ""rescue doctrine,"" as Jacobson was attempting to rescue the collateral (the building) from destruction. Ron purchased the property from the Trust, and with a portion of the note outstanding, began demolishing the building. Jacobson, directed by the trustee (his mother), attempted to intervene in the demolition but fell and injured his knee on debris. Ron moved for summary judgment on the grounds that he had negated the elements of duty, breach, and causation in Jacobson's claims. Ron argued that he was not liable for maintaining the property, that the ""rescue doctrine"" did not apply to property, and that he was not liable for the actions of Delaney Construction Company, the independent contractor performing the demolition. Ron appended evidence that included promissory note and deed of trust, his and others' deposition testimonies. Jacobson countered with evidence to refute Ron's contentions. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Ron, leading Jacobson to appeal the decision.","The court, in assessing the verdict, will affirm the trial court's decision based on several key points. Firstly, the court will consider Jacobson a licensee, since he entered the property at the trustee's direction and on business for someone other than the possessor (the trustee). As a licensee, Jacobson would only be owed a duty by Ron if there were dangers unknown to him. Since the evidence shows that Jacobson was aware of the rubble and the uneven ground when he attempted to approach the bulldozer, the condition was not hidden and hence Ron had no duty to warn him or make the area safe. Consequently, the court will rule that Ron is not liable under premises liability as he had no duty to cordon off the area or to make it safe for Jacobson, as Jacobson had actual knowledge of the danger.

Regarding the application of the rescue doctrine, the court will rule that it does not extend to cover the rescue of property. Jacobson asserted that Ron negligently created a dangerous condition with the foreseeable outcome being Jacobson's intervention to rescue the property. However, the court will find no basis in governing authority or sound reason to apply the rescue doctrine in this instance. The doctrine is meant to support heroic acts of individuals rescuing others from imminent peril, but no other individual was in peril in this case. The court, therefore, finds that the rescue doctrine is inapplicable to Jacobson's general negligence claim.

Based on these determinations, the court will conclude by affirming the summary judgment granted in favor of Ron, ruling that Ron did not breach any duty that could have contributed to Jacobson's injury, and determining that the rescue doctrine does not apply to the circumstances of this case."
"The incident at the core of this case took place around 5:00 a.m. on May 24, 1969, on Interstate Highway 10 in Texas. The situation began when an automobile operated by someone named Benoit collided with the rear end of a truck belonging to Home Transportation Company. After the collision, the truck did not stop and left the Benoit automobile blocking the inside lane of the highway. Subsequently, the victim, Guillory, arrived as a passenger in a separate vehicle. Guillory and the driver of the third vehicle stopped to check on the Benoit automobile. During this examination, an automobile driven by Croker struck and killed Guillory.

During the trial, the jury determined that the driver of the Home Transportation Company truck was negligent for leaving the scene, failing to place fusees (safety flares or similar warning devices), and failing to stop and render aid, with these acts of negligence contributing to Guillory's death. The jury did not find any negligence on Croker's part or any contributory negligence from Guillory. Benoit, the driver of the automobile that initially collided with the truck, was also found to be driving under the influence, which the jury acknowledged as negligent and a proximate cause of the collision between the Croker automobile and Guillory. However, there was no direct evidence showing Benoit's intoxication caused the original collision or the subsequent accident involving Guillory.

The trial court disregarded the jury's findings and entered judgment non obstante veredicto (notwithstanding the verdict), in favor of the defendant trucking company. The plaintiff, the surviving spouse, sought review of that decision, challenging the judgment entered in favor of the Benoit Estate and Home Transportation Company.","The court will affirm the judgment non obstante veredicto for the defendant trucking company because the evidence does not establish that the trucking company created a dangerous condition through negligence. In their reasoning, the court will likely distinguish between a moral obligation and a legal duty to render assistance or warn of potential dangers. Despite the jury's finding of negligence against the trucking company for its actions after the initial collision, the court will conclude that the company did not have a legal duty to Guillory because the incident resulted from the lawful and non-negligent use of the highway by the trucking company.

The court's application of legal precedent will consider whether the defendant trucking company ""created a dangerous condition,"" as this is a pivotal factor in determining legal duty. Drawing from precedents such as Buchanan v. Rose and Coleman v. Hudson Gas and Oil Corporation, the court will determine that creating a dangerous condition requires affirmative action such as making an excavation or obstructing the roadway, which was not demonstrated by the plaintiff in this case. As there was no direct evidence that the Home Transportation Company's driver acted negligently to cause the collision that led to Guillory's death, the court will affirm that there was no legal duty violated by the defendant and, therefore, no basis for liability. 

Furthermore, the court will not recognize intoxication as an ""ultimate issue"" in itself, but rather as a potential act of negligence that must be proven to be a ""cause in fact"" of the incident, which was not done in this case. The decision will uphold the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant trucking company, emphasizing the absence of legal duty and the failure of the plaintiff to prove the existence and violation of such a duty."
"The decedent, S. H. Moses, was killed by coming in contact with an electrical wire of the defendant ice and electric company while traveling at night, in wet conditions, in a bus after a rainstorm. When the bus reached a point on Kickapoo street, one of the horses pulling the bus fell, and the bus driver instructed the decedent to remain inside while he sought assistance. Upon the driver's return, he found the horses gone, an electrical wire in the street, and the decedent's body nearby, evidently killed by the wire's electric shock.

The company had constructed its power lines over a public road, causing the danger. The widow and children of the decedent filed a wrongful death action. The plaintiffs charged the defendant with several acts of negligence, including allowing wires to come into contact with tree limbs, permitting a broken wire to remain in the street, failing to properly insulate its wires, and failing to have suitable appliances to detect when a wire was grounded or down, or failing to inspect such appliances if they did exist. The defense argued that the wire was broken due to lightning during a storm, and the decedent was contributively negligent because he disobeyed the bus driver's instruction to stay inside the bus and came in contact with the fallen wire. The trial court left it to the jury to assess whether the company had performed its duty of care and whether there was contributory negligence by the decedent, which the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs with an award of $10,000.","The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is affirmed. The company had an obligation to exercise care that was proportionate to the danger its operations posed. This included a duty to employ precautions necessary and prudent to guard against the risk of injury for those using the highway near its electrical wires. The legal principles pertaining to the company's duty and the jury's role in assessing adherence to that standard are typically correct. By placing its electricity wires in an environment where they could interfere with public safety, the company needed to conform to a high standard, and it was proper to have the jury determine whether that standard had been met.

Regarding contributory negligence, such negligence is not to be presumed; it must be demonstrated with evidence. In this case, the evidence did not raise an issue of contributory negligence by the decedent. His actions in exiting the bus under unclear circumstances, potentially for his own safety, did not constitute negligence, and his contact with the wire seemed accidental.

The refusal of the court to give special charges requested by the defendant on contributory negligence and inspection duties is justified because either the evidence did not support these charges or they reiterated points already covered in the main charge.

If the presence of the company's wires over the public highway was unauthorized, as indicated by the testimony that the street was outside the corporate limits of the town of Jacksonville and no authority had been granted for the wires, then the defendant was maintaining a nuisance and would be responsible for resulting injuries from such obstruction. Thus, even if the company's wire broke due to lighting—a natural phenomenon—it would be liable for the consequences of the dangerous condition it created by stringing wires across a public highway without proper authority.

The company's use of an appliance within its plant to indicate downed or grounded wires shifted no responsibility from the corporation itself in ensuring timely inspection and response to wire conditions. Woodward, the employee in charge who failed to inspect, was considered the company's agent in fulfilling this duty. Therefore, any failure on his part was effectively a failure of the company itself to perform its non-delegable duties.

In affirming the lower court’s judgment, the higher court reiterates that the company had a non-delegable duty to maintain its wires and take appropriate actions to ensure public safety. Negligence on part of its employees in performing these duties is imputed to the company, and it cannot escape liability for the wrongful acts that caused the decedent's death."
"The worker (appellee) filed a lawsuit against the sand supplier (appellant) for personal injuries attributed to the use of silica-based abrasive supplied by the appellant to his employer for abrasive blasting work. Documented connections between silica sand and silicosis have been known in the industry since the 1920s, with safety codes enacted as early as 1938. The appellee performed abrasive blasting from 1984 to 1987 and contracted subacute silicosis, reducing his life expectancy by 20 to 25 years. The appellee had used the protective equipment but sometimes inadequately.

The warning on the product at the time stated, ""May be injurious to health if proper protective equipment is not used."" The appellee testified that he used an air-supplied hood and a paper dust mask for protection, assuming the hood was for protecting his face from rebounding particles and the mask for nuisance dust. The particles causing silicosis are invisible and can be inhaled without an awareness of danger. The appellant provided a Material Safety Data Sheet and Technical Fact Sheet to the employer that recommended using air-supplied hoods for ""eye protection"" but did not explicitly mention silicosis or its harmful effects.

In 1993, the appellant enhanced the warning labels following the appellee's diagnosis. Information known about the risks of silica dust and safety procedures when they first began selling the product in 1982 was only communicated in the revised warning labels in 1993. Under Texas law, a product is unreasonably dangerous without adequate warnings.

The appellant argued that they provided sufficient warning and maintained a ""sophisticated user defense,"" claiming they were absolved from failure-to-warn liability on the premise that the product was only sold to industrial businesses who should know the risks. Appellant argued that they could reasonably rely on the intermediary (employer) to warn the ultimate consumer (employee). The trial court, however, found against the appellant, denying the ""sophisticated user defense"" and upholding that the appellant still had a duty to warn the appellee.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court examined several factors, including the magnitude of the risk, the product’s danger, the warnings provided, the intermediary's ability to communicate risks to the users, and the burden on the supplier to warn users directly.

In this case, the product was dangerous, and the warnings did not inform the appellee of the health risks or the proper safety measures. Despite some knowledge of risks at Spincote (appellee's employer), there was evidence that Spincote did not fully comprehend the hazards or adhere to proper safety standards. Therefore, the intermediary could not be considered a reliable conveyor of the necessary safety information to the appellee. Given silicosis can lead to severe health complications and death, the risk was significant, and the burden on the appellant to place an adequate warning on the bags was minimal.

The sophisticated user defense did not absolve the appellant because there was no reasonable assurance that the employer (intermediary) would inform and protect employees. The reliance on the employer to provide warnings was not reasonable due to the foreseeable deviations from necessary safety practices. According to Restatement (Second) of Torts § 388, if the product is highly dangerous and practical means are available for the supplier to directly inform users, such measures must be taken, especially when the supplier cannot reasonably trust the intermediary to do so.

Given this, the appellate court concluded that the appellant retained the duty to provide adequate warnings to the ultimate user and that their failure to do so justified the verdict. The sophisticated user defense was unavailable to the appellant based on the evidence. The appellate court also did not find error in the trial court's decision to exclude certain evidence concerning causation or its refusal to instruct the jury on the sophisticated user defense. Therefore, the judgment in favor of the appellee was affirmed."
"In November 1987, Joe Pickle, an employee of LTV Aerospace and Defense Co. (LTV), was killed when he was crushed between a hangar door and a wall at LTV's premises. The hangar was being renovated, which included relocating door control switches to a security booth for access control. In February 1987, LTV contracted with Bel-Ton Electric Service, Inc. (Bel-Ton) to move these switches. Bel-Ton relocated one set of switches but left another set on the hangar’s east wall, contending that their contract did not mandate moving these switches.

After the relocation by Bel-Ton, an LTV computer programmer jammed one of the east wall switches to discourage personnel from using the hangar door as a shortcut to the restrooms, leading to the hangar door operating unexpectedly. When Joe Pickle opened the hangar door using the relocated switches and attempted to change light bulbs, he was unexpectedly caught and crushed as the hangar door closed due to the other jammed switch.

Suzie Y. Pickle and National Union Fire Insurance Co. filed a lawsuit against Bel-Ton, contending that it was negligent for not moving both sets of hangar door switches, which they argued was a proximate cause of Joe Pickle’s death. Bel-Ton contended that it was not contractually obliged to move the second set of switches, the possibly ""jammable"" switch was not modified by them, and that the jamming of the switch by the LTV employee was an unforeseeable, intervening cause that excused them from liability.

The trial court ruled against Bel-Ton, finding its failure to relocate all switches a proximate cause of the death. The court refused Bel-Ton’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and denied its motion for a credit on compensatory damages for $345,000 paid by LTV to Mrs. Pickle in an out-of-court settlement. Bel-Ton submitted that this credit should be applied on the basis that both defendants were responsible for the same damages, and that the settlement compensated for the same injury for which Bel-Ton was found liable. Bel-Ton appealed the decision.","The evidence presented suggests that Bel-Ton had a duty to create safe conditions, which it breached by not relocating both sets of switches. There is credible testimony that not moving both sets of switches to the security booth was negligent and contributed to creating an unsafe condition that was a proximate cause of Joe Pickle’s death. The foreseeability aspect of proximate cause is likely satisfied because Bel-Ton could or should have anticipated that leaving two sets of operational switches could lead to unpredictable and hazardous situations. 

Additionally, the accident investigator Edward Campbell affirmed that having two operational switches controlling one door created an unsafe condition. Charles Rovell, lead safety engineer at LTV, also testified that the accident might not have occurred if Bel-Ton had removed the east-wall switches as he had expected them to do based on the blueprints.

The act of the LTV employee in jamming the switch is likely not a superseding intervening cause because the potentially harmful situation was already in existence due to Bel-Ton's negligence. Both legal and factual sufficiency exist to support the jury's findings because there is significant evidence that Bel-Ton's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the accident and the injury was foreseeable. Consequently, given the evidence, it is probable that the appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision, determining that Bel-Ton was a proximate cause of the decedent’s death, and it will validate the trial court's refusal to grant Bel-Ton’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.

Concerning the settlement credit, without evidence of the terms of the LTV settlement (allegedly for exemplary damages for gross negligence), the appellate court will not be able to determine if the set-off requested is applicable under the ""one satisfaction"" rule. If it's proven that the settlement with LTV covered exemplary damages only, and Bel-Ton’s liability pertains solely to actual damages for simple negligence, Bel-Ton will not be entitled to the credit. Absent evidence of the terms of the settlement agreement, Bel-Ton will fail in its burden of proof, and the appellate court will likely reject the claim for credits towards the judgment based on the earlier settlement by LTV."
"The insured, Eli Landman, suffered from pulmonary emphysema and congestive heart failure and had been hospitalized three months before his death. On December 1, 1969, he sustained injuries, including rib fractures and liver lacerations, in an automobile accident. He passed away in the early hours of December 10, 1969. Four physicians provided testimony regarding whether the heart and lung diseases were substantial proximate causes of death or if they were indirect and remote causes. All agreed that the car accident injuries precipitated the final hospitalization and death on the exact date, but there was disagreement over the role of the liver injury in causing death. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy insisted Landman ""died of liver lacerations,"" arguing that it was not a reasonable probability for the lung and heart conditions to have contributed as causes of death.

The insurance policy issued by Union Mutual Life Insurance Company excluded coverage for ""any loss to an Insured Person caused by or resulting from...disease of any kind."" The coverage was for loss resulting from an injury defined as ""bodily injury caused by an accident...resulting directly and independently of all other causes.""

The plaintiff sued the defendant insurer to recover accidental death benefits. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendant insurer, concluding no benefits were owed. The appellate court reversed the decision, causing the insurer to appeal. The appellate court's decision was influenced by conflicting jury findings related to the causes of Landman's death. The jury found that the auto accident injuries were the sole and independent causes of his death but also found the lung and heart disease to be proximate causes of his death, which contradicted each other. The irreconcilable findings did not support a clear judgment for either side.

The trial court gave no other instructions or definitions related to these issues besides the definition of ""proximate cause"" that states a cause must naturally and continuously produce an event and without it, the event would not have occurred. Multiple proximate causes could exist for an event.","The verdict will affirm the reversal of the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant insurer because of the irreconcilable findings that the jury presented. Since the jury found the auto accident injuries to be the sole and independent causes of Landman’s death, their concurrent determination that his pre-existing lung and heart disease were proximate causes created an irreconcilable conflict. This inconsistency means that the jury did not offer an acceptable resolution to the disputed facts of the case.

Despite the plaintiff having the burden of proving that insured's death resulted directly from bodily injuries caused by the accident and not from lung and heart disease, the conflicting jury findings prevent a definite judgment for the defendant. The law requires that the factual issue be resolved before a judgment can be rendered, and since the plaintiff could not conclusively prove the issues surrounding the exclusion in the insurance contract due to the contradictory jury findings, the case must be retried to establish a consistent fact pattern.

Given this assessment, the likely reasoning behind the affirmation of the appellate court's decision is based on procedural grounds, requiring a new trial to acquire a consistent verdict that can support a legal conclusion regarding the insurance claim. The insurer will not be successful in overturning the appellate court's decision because of the unaddressed conflict in the jury's findings, which does not support a clear judgment."
"Members of the Assembly of God Church in Kaufman, Texas, experienced a power outage on January 21, 1998, due to a lightning strike that hit a nearby transformer. Pastor D.G. Council called 9-1-1 and was informed that Texas Utilities Electric Company (T.U.) would restore the power as soon as possible. The church members left the building safely, and no one checked for tripped breakers. The next day, the church still had no power, and after multiple checks by church officials, it was clear there was no exterior damage to the church. In the evening, Gary Graves, the church's music director, reported the outage to Council, who then called T.U.'s emergency line, requesting to be informed when power would be restored. A senior serviceman from T.U. was dispatched, found lightning damage to the pole facility serving the church, and was instructed to replace the transformers that evening. The repair crew did not notify Council, despite his request and Council not answering when they tried to reach him. After repairs, power was restored, and within an hour, the church was on fire, ultimately leading to the sanctuary's destruction.

The church sued T.U. for negligence and gross negligence in repairing and restoring power. T.U. filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that their possible negligence did not exclusively cause the damages and citing a tariff that limited its liability. This tariff stipulated that T.U. was not liable for damages from faulty downstream wiring or acts of God unless T.U.'s negligence was the sole proximate cause. The church challenged the tariff as unreasonable and in violation of the Texas Constitution.

T.U. presented evidence from the repairs and the incident, including oral depositions, statements, experts' reports, and the tariff; the trial court granted the summary judgment without specifying grounds, leading to this appeal. The church argued that T.U. did not negate its negligence as the sole proximate cause; that T.U.'s conduct was grossly negligent; and that the service tariff was unreasonable and unconstitutional.}

{","When reviewing the appeals court's affirmation of the trial court's judgment, it will focus on the church's claims against T.U. and the reasonableness of the service tariff. The court will find that the tariff is indeed reasonable as it pertains to economic damages, as it has been approved by the Public Utility Commission (P.U.C.) and only holds the utility liable if its negligence is the sole proximate cause of damages. This aligns with Texas law, which traditionally finds such tariffs reasonable on their face when applied to economic damages caused by an utility's ordinary negligence.

As for the negligence claim, the appellate court will resolve that the church has not presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether T.U.'s alleged negligence was the sole proximate cause of the fire and resulting damages. The evidence will suggest that there were multiple proximate causes for the fire, including the initial lightning strike, possible damage to internal wiring, a failure by the church to turn off equipment after the outage, and the restoration of power. Since there cannot be one sole cause when multiple factors led to the fire, the court will hold that the church has not met the standard imposed by the tariff for T.U. to be liable.

Regarding gross negligence, the court will determine that the church has failed to present evidence that T.U.'s conduct both involved an extreme risk considering the potential harm and that T.U. had actual subjective awareness of that risk and nevertheless proceeded with conscious indifference. Without such evidence, the church cannot show that T.U.'s conduct went beyond ordinary negligence to gross negligence.

Consequently, the appeals court will overrule all three points of error raised by the church and affirm the trial court's judgment, meaning T.U. will not be held liable for the damage to the church's property.}"
"In the early morning hours of January 31, 1998, Karen Bay's car collided with a retaining wall on Interstate Highway 35. Bay exited the vehicle and was on the lane near the HOV lane. Chad Rosell stopped to assist Bay. Loyd Rieve, driving a Central West bus, attempted to pass the accident in the HOV lane, driving at least fifty miles per hour, striking and killing Chad. The plaintiffs, Chad's survivors, filed a wrongful death and survival action against Central West, Rieve, and Bay. Central West accepted that Rieve was operating within his employment scope. The trial court excluded Central West from the apportionment question, addressing only Rieve, Bay, and Chad's negligence. The jury found actual damages of $809,312.96, found Central West grossly negligent, and awarded $1,250,000.00 in punitive damages. However, fault for Chad's death was apportioned as 70% to Chad, 20% to Rieve, and 10% to Bay. Under Texas law, because Chad’s fault exceeded 50%, a take-nothing judgment was rendered against the plaintiffs. On appeal, issues raised by the plaintiffs included the trial judge's qualifications, jury submission errors regarding liability and apportionment questions, error in omitting instructions on the Good Samaritan and rescue doctrines, factual insufficiency supporting the negligence apportionment, punitive damages exclusion, and an improper jury influence claim.","The judgment was affirmed by the appellate court, which found no reversible errors in the trial proceedings. The trial judge’s suspension of his law license for nonpayment of bar dues and subsequent reinstatement were deemed not appropriate grounds for appeal, as he was still considered a de facto judge. The appellate court agreed that Central West's inclusion in the ordinary negligence liability question was unnecessary since respondeat superior established liability based on Rieve's negligence. Further, gross negligence claims justified the separate jury questions regarding Central West’s negligent entrustment, hiring, supervision, and retention. The jury had discretion in allocating responsibility and their finding that Chad was 70% at fault was supported by sufficient evidence, despite conflicting testimony. There was no jury misconduct warranting a new trial since information about court scheduling did not qualify as an outside influence on the deliberations that could affect the verdict. Lastly, because the Rosells were barred from recovering actual damages due to Chad's percentage of fault, they could not receive punitive damages, notwithstanding the jury's findings of Central West's gross negligence."
"The deceased child's parents, appellants Jose and Florencia Campos, brought a lawsuit against Ysleta General Hospital, Inc., Pedro Ortega, and Centro Medico Del Valle (the appellees) claiming negligence and intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress following the death of their five-year-old son. The mother, Mrs. Campos, had sought medical treatment for her ill son Jose, first at Ysleta General Hospital where she was turned away because she couldn't prove she could pay for the medical expenses. Then at Centro Medico Del Valle, a community health clinic, she was told to fill out paperwork and wait for an available room; perceiving this as another payment impediment, she decided to take her son to another hospital. After being admitted to the emergency room at R.E. Thomason General Hospital, the child was pronounced dead due to respiratory arrest caused by cerebral edema.

In the trial, the appellants claimed the refusal by the appellees to provide prompt medical attention resulted in negligence and the infliction of emotional distress. The trial court, however, granted a directed verdict in favor of the appellees, which led the appellants to seek further review. The appellants contended that there was sufficient evidence to raise material facts related to each cause of action and that the trial court erred in excluding certain testimony. During the appeal, the court had to review whether there was any evidence of probative force that established the appellees' actions proximately caused the death and whether the appellants' emotional distress was a result thereof. The physicians' testimonies indicated possibilities but did not confirm a causal connection based on reasonable medical probability, thus failing to support proximate cause.","The court would affirm the directed verdict because the evidence presented by the appellants does not prove with sufficient probative force that the actions of the appellees proximately caused the death of the child. It would be noted that proximate cause requires both foreseeability and cause-in-fact, with cause-in-fact needing a substantial factor in bringing about the injury which would not have occurred otherwise. In this case, the cause-in-fact is not established because the medical testimonies only suggest a possibility, not a probability, that earlier treatment could have saved the child, thus constituting mere speculation that is insufficient for establishing a causal link. 

For the emotional distress claims, the appellants would be required to show that appellees acted intentionally or recklessly, and that such conduct was extreme and outrageous, directly causing severe emotional distress to appellants. However, the court would deem that any emotional distress suffered by the appellants arose from the death of their son, rather than from any proven actions of the appellees. Since cause and severe emotional distress could not be satisfactorily proven to be directly attributable to appellees' actions, the claims for both negligence and infliction of emotional distress would not hold, and the verdict in favor of the appellees would be affirmed."
"Celia Smith, a 91-year-old resident at McKinney Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center (MHRC), had multiple health issues including dementia, hypertension, and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). She required constant medical care, including anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. After a dosage increase, Smith became lethargic with poor oxygenation and a high fever. She was admitted to the hospital with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her condition initially improved with treatment, but her Coumadin was discontinued. Smith's health declined again, and despite subsequent medical interventions, including antibiotics, she returned to the hospital in respiratory distress. She suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and was declared dead hours later.

Smith's son, appellant Marcus Smith, filed a medical negligence action against MHRC and Menur Beshir, LVN, alleging MHRC staff and Beshir failed to follow physician orders, implement nursing interventions, and perform and report appropriate nursing assessments. They contended that the negligence in monitoring and administering Coumadin was the proximate cause of Smith's hospitalization and infection. Appellant sought survival damages on behalf of Smith's estate and damages for wrongful death. Dr. Summit Gupta was designated as an expert witness for the appellant, but the court excluded his testimony on the cause of Smith's death as unreliable, leading to a summary judgment in favor of the appellees (MHRC and Beshir). The appellant appealed the summary judgment and exclusion of Dr. Gupta's testimony.","The appellate court will affirm the exclusion of Dr. Gupta's testimony regarding causation of death, considering it unreliable. The court will find his speculative opinions cannot establish the medical causation necessary for a medical negligence claim. However, the court will also find that Dr. Gupta addressed the standard of care and other related issues for Smith's initial hospitalization, which were not part of the appellees' motion to exclude and therefore should not have been entirely excluded.

The appellate court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the wrongful death claim but will critique the trial court for dismissing the case in its entirety, including the survival claim. It will determine that Dr. Gupta's testimony didn't raise a genuine issue of material fact on proximate cause due to his inability to conclusively link the alleged acts of negligence with the cause of death. As for the claims against Beshir, the appellate court will agree with the trial court's decision, considering there was a lack of specific evidence that he breached any standard of care or that his actions were a proximate cause of injury or damages.

Nonetheless, the appellate court will challenge the judgment on appellant's survival claim against MHRC. It will find the survival claim, alleging negligence that caused injury to Smith prior to her death, was not fully considered, as the appellees' summary judgment motion focused on the negligence causing death, not injury. Consequently, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment with respect to the survival claim and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.

ROBERT D. BURNS, III
CHIEF JUSTICE"
"The case involves an appeal by the appellant, Community Public Service Company, an electric company, challenging the order of the District Court of Red River County, Texas, which found in favor of the appellee, Raymond D. Dugger. Dugger sought damages for the destruction of his barn and other property by fire, which he alleged was proximately caused by the negligence of the appellant's employees.

The incident occurred on June 16, 1967, after a thunderstorm in the Fulbright area of Red River County, Texas. The appellant's employees had been dispatched to repair and restore electrical service to the area, including the appellee's property. The appellant's employees discovered a blown fuse in a transformer serving the appellee's property and, upon replacing the fuse, found that it blew out again. Without adequately checking for short circuits or taking necessary precautionary measures, they replaced the fuse a second time, even though there was evidence of arcing and a popping noise, indicating a short circuit. They also re-energized the line connecting to the appellee's barn, which had no fuse protection from short circuits, soon after which the barn caught fire and was destroyed, along with its contents and nearby buildings.

The appellee introduced both direct and circumstantial evidence of negligence on the part of the appellant's employees. The appellant contended that ""no evidence"" or ""insufficient evidence"" supported the implied findings of negligence and proximate cause in the trial court's ruling.","The court would affirm the order finding the appellant liable for damages, as the question of whether the appellant’s negligence proximately caused the fire could be proven by circumstantial evidence. Given the detailed evidence provided, it would be considered that appellant's employees had a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence to prevent injury or damage when handling electricity. The appellant's employees were aware of the dangers inherent in electrical short circuits and were also aware that there was a short circuit present in one of the appellee's lines. They were also knowledgeable that the appellee's barn had no fuse protection. Nonetheless, they carelessly re-energized the line with knowledge of these hazards. 

This failure to properly inspect and ascertain where the short circuit was on the line, or to notify the appellee despite knowing the lack of fuse protection, would be deemed negligent. The employees’ decision to proceed without remedying the identified dangers was a breach of the standard of care expected from a reasonable person under similar circumstances, and thus constituted negligence. 

The prediction would also consider the law that places a duty on those who handle electricity to do so with care proportional to the danger involved. Moreover, the decision would acknowledge that issues of negligence and proximate cause can be supported by circumstantial evidence, which was sufficiently available in this case.

Applying the legal principle that circumstantial evidence can establish cause, the court found that it was more probable than not that the appellant's negligence was the proximate cause of the fire. Theories proposed by the appellant, such as lightning being the cause of the fire, were discounted by their employees’ testimonies. With no alternative explanations reasonably outweighing the circumstantial evidence of negligence, the appellant's argument regarding their service contract with the appellee would not relieve them from liability; attempts to contract out of such responsibility would be contrary to public policy.

Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed, sustaining the venue of the cause in Red River County, Texas, and concluding that the negligence of the appellant through its employees more probably than not resulted in the destructive fire, leading to the ensuing damages for which the appellant would be held responsible."
"Appellants Anthony F. Ambrosio, Jr. and Linda W. Ambrosio, individually and as Personal Representatives of the Estate of Alek W. Ambrosio, sued appellee Carter's Shooting Center d/b/a Carter's Country, a Texas corporation that operates gun stores, following the murder of their son, Alek, who was killed during a car jacking. The murder happened after a gun, previously stolen from one of appellee's stores, was used by the perpetrator, Jaime Guerrero. The appellants alleged four causes of action: negligence, negligence per se, strict liability, and gross negligence, claiming that appellee violated its duty to exercise proper care in the storage and display of firearms.

The gun, a nine millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun, was stolen by Rafael Monsivaiz from an unlocked display case at appellee's Katy Freeway store. After the theft, the gun was sold and changed hands multiple times before ending up with Guerrero. Appellee had knowledge of prior gun thefts from its stores, including a past incident where a stolen gun was used in a murder.

Appellee filed a general denial and a third-party action for contribution and indemnity against those directly involved in the carjacking and murder and moved for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment. The trial court granted the traditional motion and denied the no-evidence motion.

The appellants raised four points of error on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there were disputed material facts regarding foreseeability and causation; (2) the trial court erred in excluding government reports and expert witness affidavits; (3) the trial court erred in denying a motion for continuance; and (4) the trial court erred in denying a motion for new trial.","The ruling that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellee will be affirmed due to the legal principle that disproves the element of proximate cause, specifically cause in fact, as a matter of law. In this context, proximate cause requires both foreseeability and cause in fact. Foreseeability exists as appellee might have anticipated the danger that lax security could lead to stolen guns being used in crimes. However, cause in fact necessitates that the negligent act be a substantial factor in the injury, without which the harm would not have occurred. It must be shown by evidence that is substantive and not merely speculative, and cannot just furnish conditions that made the injury possible.

Here, appellee's failure to secure the firearms only created a condition that allowed the theft to occur. This, however, was too remote from the murder to constitute a legal cause. The chain of events from the theft to the murder included multiple transfers of the gun and a temporal, geographical separation between the store and the crime scene.

Given that cause in fact was negated as a matter of law, the negligence and negligence per se claims were correctly dismissed. There is no substantial evidence that directly connects appellee's conduct to the crime in a way that would not have happened otherwise. With regards to the second and third points, the evidence and testimony that were excluded would not raise additional material fact issues on the element of cause in fact. Denial of the motion for continuance was within the trial court's discretion as any further evidence would not affect the determination of cause in fact. The fourth point, along with the cross-points by appellee, become moot given the trial court's correct application of law in granting summary judgment."
"In Nacogdoches County, Texas, a group of cotton sellers (the appellants) took legal action against a set of carriers (the appellees) for damages due to the loss of cotton that was being hauled by the carriers. The carriers transported goods part-time while focusing primarily on farming. During one particular instance, while hauling cotton for the sellers, the bales caught fire and were completely destroyed. In the initial trials, no verdict was achieved in the first, and in the subsequent two, the jury found in favor of the defendants (carriers).

The carriers contended they were not common carriers but rather bailees or carriers for hire in only this particular instance, thus assuming they should not be liable under the stringent responsibilities of common carriers. They also argued that even if they were considered common carriers, they should be exempt from liability as the destruction of cotton was caused by an act of God—a sudden wind that was not under their control and was therefore not their fault.

The appeal brought into question whether entities that transport goods for hire, occasionally and not as a principal occupation, should be considered common carriers subject to the full extent of liabilities that accompany that designation. Definitions cited from legal authorities defined common carriers as those who undertake to carry goods for hire for the public, irrespective of whether this is a continuous or occasional occupation. The case also discussed the concept of an act of God as a possible defense for carriers, questioning whether an ordinary wind that spread fire to the cotton could be considered such an act.","The court held that common carriers are defined by their service of transporting goods for hire for the public, regardless of whether it is their usual occupation or only an incidental one. Therefore, any individual who transports goods for hire periodically and intermittently is to be considered a common carrier and is to shoulder all the associated responsibilities.

The appeals court, in considering the verdict, will evaluate the explanations of common carriers by various legal authorities and deduce that the appellees fall under that category. The court will find that the fact the carriers only operated their wagon during the hauling season, and that transporting goods was an incidental occupation, does not prevent them from being classified as common carriers.

In terms of the 'act of God' defense, the appeals court will predict that placing the cotton in proximity to a fire, even without an existing wind, can be seen as an overt risk, and the carriers should have foreseen the potential for the wind to carry the fire to the cotton. The fact that the wind is deemed an ordinary event in nature that can reasonably be anticipated will lead to the conclusion that the carriers are not relieved of their responsibilities in this regard. The court will presume that because the carriers hold the status of common carriers and since no act of God can be established, they are liable for the loss.

Taking these considerations into account, the court is likely to reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of the carriers and would remand the case for a new trial, concluding that the carriers, as common carriers, are responsible for the loss of the cotton."
"Hygeia Dairy Co. (""Hygeia"") sold 51 heads of dairy cattle to Abelardo Gonzalez in April 1991, which were then incorporated into Gonzalez's existing herd. Gonzalez later purchased additional cattle from another supplier. In 1993 and 1994, cattle in Gonzalez's herd began dying, leading to a total herd liquidation at the end of 1994. Gonzalez sued Hygeia for negligence and gross negligence for failing to disclose that Hygeia’s herd contained diseased cattle. During the trial, a jury found Hygeia negligent and grossly negligent, attributing 35% contributory negligence to Gonzalez and assessing actual damages at $291,000 and punitive damages at $3,000,000. The trial court reformed the punitive damage award to align with Texas law, offset Gonzalez's contributory negligence from actual damages, and awarded $1,419,501.98, including prejudgment interest.

Hygeia's appeal raised four points of contention: 1) error in failing to instruct the jury on mitigation of damages, 2) insufficiency of evidence supporting the gross negligence finding, 3) lack of duty to disclose common cattle diseases, and 4) inaccuracies in the trial record. The appeals court noted Hygeia was liable for selling diseased cattle but found Hygeia was entitled to an instruction on mitigation of damages, meaning a new trial was necessary.

Detailed facts about the cattle purchase, diseases, herd management, and evidence presented at trial underline the substantial losses and production issues faced by Gonzalez, the realization of disease presence in the herd sold by Hygeia, and the subsequent legal proceedings. Experts testified about the management of diseases and the impact on Gonzalez's herd, while the record accuracy and the broader question of Hygeia’s duty to disclose herd diseases were contested.","The appeals court is expected to affirm the trial court's ruling in part, recognizing that Hygeia had a duty to disclose communicable diseases known to substantially harm the productivity of the buyer's herd. Affirmation of the duty to disclose is based on the evidence indicating that Gonzalez sought healthy cows, combined with expert testimony suggesting that a reasonably prudent dairy farmer would disclose diseases such as Johne's disease due to transmission risks and eradication difficulties.

However, the court will also reverse and remand in part, specifically concerning Hygeia's contention on the issue of mitigation of damages. The court will find that the evidence presented should have entitled Hygeia to an instruction on the mitigation of damages for the jury to consider, as the trial evidence showed that Gonzalez had not taken all reasonable measures to understand and control the spread of disease in his herd after the cattle purchase. The trial court's refusal to submit a jury instruction on mitigation of damages will be deemed an error because evidence indicated that a reasonably prudent dairy farmer in Gonzalez's position would have taken additional steps, including testing and autopsies, to minimize losses, which Gonzalez failed to do.

In summary, Hygeia's failure to disclose known communicable diseases in its herd upholds the duty to disclose finding, but the trial court's omission of a mitigation instruction warrants a new trial where jury considerations include Gonzalez's potential contributory negligence in failing to mitigate damages post-discovery of the diseases in his herd."
"Lela Baker, as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy issued by JCPenney Life Insurance Company to her husband Howard Baker, filed a suit after JCPenney paid $40,000 under part III of Howard's policy for ""all other injuries resulting in a loss"" but denied liability under part II, which provided a $100,000 benefit for injuries by accident while occupying a private passenger automobile. On March 13, 1996, around 5:45 a.m., Howard's truck drove off the road and plunged into Lake Granbury while he was making deliveries. Eyewitnesses saw the truck go into the water and later saw Howard resurface momentarily before disappearing. His body was later retrieved from Lake Granbury. Autopsy results by Dr. Nizam Peerwani indicated the cause of death as ""severe occlusive coronary atherosclerosis with terminal drowning (lake),"" and noted heart-related issues such as hypertension and enlarged heart. Despite findings that suggested a heart attack might have contributed to the accident, the exact sequence of events that led to Howard entering the water could not be conclusively determined. Dr. Kuban, an expert in internal medicine, challenged the assertion that Howard's heart condition played a role in his death. He clarified how heart attacks and cardiac conduction problems would likely have prevented Howard from exiting the truck if they had occurred. The case hinged on whether Howard's death was caused by an accident directly and independently of all other causes, as required by the insurance policy. The trial also involved the definition of ""occupying"" the vehicle at the time of the incident, and whether or not Howard was still in the truck when he began drowning. There were conflicting testimonies about the time Howard's truck was underwater and how long Howard was seen in the water. In regards to the expert witness, Dr. Kuban, there was debate over his qualifications and the reliability of his testimony based on his experience and expertise related to internal medicine, cardiac conditions, and the interpretation of autopsy reports.","The jury's verdict in favor of Lela Baker was based on evidence suggesting that Howard's death was indeed caused by drowning, an accidental bodily injury directly and independently of all other causes. Despite Peerwani's indication of Howard's pre-existing heart conditions, it was not proven that these conditions were a proximate or concurrent cause of death. The jury could have reasoned that even if a non-lethal heart event occurred, it did not materially contribute to Howard's death, aligning with the precedent set by cases such as Stroburg versus Insurance Company of North America. The jury might have accepted Dr. Kuban's testimony about the effects of serious heart conduction problems, and relied on the argument that a fatal heart condition would have made it impossible for Howard to free himself and exit the vehicle. 

It was plausible for the jury to infer from available evidence that Howard began inhaling water while still within his submerged vehicle, meeting the definition of ""occupying"" as stated in the policy. This inference was supported by the chain of events, the physical state of Howard's body when found, and witness testimonies regarding his brief resurfacing and subsequent disappearance.

Dr. Kuban's qualifications as an expert witness likely rested upon his extensive experience in internal medicine, specifically with treating cardiac and respiratory issues, and his routine practice of making cause-of-death determinations. By showing that Kuban's expertise was directly related to the key medical issues in the case, the trial court could have found his opinion reliable. Applying the Gammill standard, which allows for reliable experience-based testimony beyond strictly scientific evidence, Kuban's explanation about the lack of postmortem evidence of a heart attack or severe cardiac conduction problem could have been accepted. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deeming Kuban's testimony reliable.

Considering the aforementioned points, the final outcome of the case would affirm the trial court's judgment against JCPenney Life Insurance Company, upholding the jury's verdict and the awarded damages to Lela Baker, including the statutory penalty, interest, and attorney's fees. The appellate court would likely not find the evidence so against the weight and preponderance as to be manifestly unjust, and would rule that the trial court acted within its discretion regarding the admissibility of expert testimony."
"The representative of the patient's estate, Dianne Swan, and other wrongful death beneficiaries, collectively referred to as ""appellees,"" filed a healthcare liability claim against various hospitals and healthcare providers, collectively referred to as ""appellants,"" and other defendants. The claim arose after Dr. John Q.A. Webb, treating Jennifer Renee Abshire for a herniated disc, referred her to Dr. Merrimon Baker, an orthopedic surgeon. Baker performed a bilateral lumbar laminectomy and diskectomy on Abshire at Renaissance Hospital. During the surgery, Baker accidentally transected Abshire's right internal iliac artery and failed to recognize and repair the artery, which led to massive internal hemorrhaging, cardiac arrest, and Abshire's death.

Appellees filed claims for malicious credentialing, negligence, and gross negligence against appellants. They argued that appellants failed to maintain an appropriate standard of care by allowing incompetent and unqualified physicians to operate and inadequately evaluating, training, and supervising nursing and staff members. There were claims that the various defendants were also involved in a joint enterprise aimed at making a profit via the delivery of medical services to Abshire.

Appellees supported their claims with expert reports from an anesthesiologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a family physician, and a hospital administrator. Appellants filed objections and motions to dismiss under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 74.351, which requires plaintiffs to provide expert reports in healthcare liability claims, challenging the reports' adequacy. The trial court denied appellants' objections and motions to dismiss, leading to appellants filing an appeal.","The appellate court upheld the trial court's denial of the appellants' motions to dismiss. The court found that the expert reports provided by appellees discussed standards of care, breach, and causation with sufficient specificity and thereby informed appellants of the representative's allegations and allowed the trial court to conclude that the claims had merit. The qualifications of the experts, including Simpson's prior involvement with hospital quality assurance committees and the lack of a direct physician-patient relationship between some of the appellants and Abshire, were not seen as hindrances to the acceptance of their reports. In the instance of Shorr not being a physician, his report does not offer an opinion concerning causation and thus was not disqualified on those grounds.

The reports explained in detail how the standard of care was breached by both the treatment providers and the credentialing process conducted by the appellants. The causal relationship between the transection of Abshire's artery and her subsequent death was further clarified by explaining the progression of events and the negligent actions responsible for the failure to diagnose and treat the hemorrhage appropriately. The appellate court viewed the cumulative nature of the reports as adequately addressing all types of claims asserted by appellees, including negligence, malicious credentialing, and gross negligence.

Overall, the court found that the expert reports demonstrated a reasonable, good-faith effort to comply with the statutory definition of an expert report and rejected appellants' arguments that the reports had to address each specific factual allegation of negligence enumerated in the plaintiff's petition or provide detailed insights into appellants' internal processes or credentialing standards. Therefore, the reports were deemed both non-speculative and well-founded, and the judgment against appellants was affirmed."
"The case involves two related wrongful death and survival actions brought by the estates of victims (respondents) against the petitioner alcohol beverage licensees (El Chico Corporation and Joleemo, Inc.) in Texas. The victims died in separate incidents involving intoxicated drivers who had been served alcoholic beverages by the petitioners. The lower courts initially dismissed the cases, one by summary judgment and the other for failure to state a cause of action. However, upon appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissals, determining that the matters should proceed to trial.

In the first case, El Chico v. Poole, the Pooles sued El Chico Corporation and Rene Saenz for the death of their son, Larry. El Chico served alcohol to Saenz, an admitted alcoholic who ""blacked out"" and couldn't remember the events leading to the accident where he collided with Larry's car after running a red light. Saenz's intoxication was evident at the scene of the collision, and a breath alcohol test showed a reading of 0.18. The appeals court found that El Chico owed a duty to the public not to serve alcohol to an already intoxicated person and that whether El Chico breached this duty and caused the Pooles' damages was for a jury to decide.

In the second case, Joleemo v. Evans, the Evanses sued Joleemo, Inc., d/b/a Bandy's, for the death of their son, Patrick, alleging that Bandy's continued to serve alcohol to Henry Scott Smith even though they knew or should have known he was intoxicated. Smith later hit Patrick's motorcycle. The lower court dismissed this case for failing to state a cause of action, but the appeals court reversed, holding that a tavern owner who continues to serve an intoxicated person may owe a duty to third persons.

Both El Chico and Joleemo subsequently sought review, arguing that without a legislative dramshop act explicitly creating a civil remedy and cause of action against alcohol beverage licensees, no cause of action could be maintained against them.","The court will affirm the reversal of the lower courts' dismissals, upholding the decisions of the Court of Appeals. The verdict will acknowledge that alcoholic beverage licensees owe a duty to the general public not to serve alcoholic beverages to a person when the licensee knows or should have known the patron was intoxicated. Serving alcohol to an already intoxicated person who is likely to drive constitutes negligence as a matter of law. Whether each petitioner breached their duty and if that breach proximately caused the victims' injuries and deaths, taking into account the concepts of cause in fact and foreseeability, will be determined as an issue of fact for a jury to decide.

The verdict will be guided by a combination of common law negligence principles and statutory standards of conduct under the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, specifically Section 101.63(a), which prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons. The court will hold that the statute embodies a reasonable standard of care that serves to protect the welfare, health, peace, temperance, and safety of the public.

Furthermore, the petitioners' argument that the absence of a legislative dramshop act equates to no civil cause of action will be rejected. The court will note that the regulation of alcoholic beverages does not preclude the applicability of civil standards of conduct. The court will emphasize that the common law of torts evolves with society's changes, and as such, courts must recognize the evolution of these principles and acknowledge the legislative efforts to protect the public from the hazards associated with intoxication and driving.

Lastly, the court will dismiss concern that the announced rule is overly burdensome on licensees, stating that they are already bound by law to control the amount of alcohol served. Petitioners are expected only to exercise reasonable care in discontinuing service to patrons they know or should know are intoxicated. The establishment of this cause of action aims to incentivize compliance with safety regulations, ensure justice for victims, and affirm that every person has a duty to prevent foreseeable risks of injury to others. As such, the cause of action announced will stand as valid under the principles of negligence owed to all individuals in society."
"The appellants in this case, which include a hospital and associated medical personnel, are appealing a judgment of $3,311,500.00 that was based on a jury verdict. The proceedings revolved around a medical malpractice case concerning retrolental fibroplasia (RLF), a condition that led to the blindness of Kellie Birchfield, the appellees' child. Kellie was born prematurely at Wadley Hospital in Texarkana and weighed only two pounds seven ounces. Due to her preterm birth, she required special medical attention in the hospital nursery, including the administration of high levels of oxygen—a factor scientifically linked to the development of RLF in premature infants. The appellees, Kellie's parents, claimed damages for the blindness caused by alleged medical malpractice.

The hospital and physicians raised various points of error in their appeal, including concerns over jury instructions, qualification of attorneys, and the admittance of hearsay evidence. They also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict, and the inclusion of all damages and judgment interest. The appellees counter-claimed that not all damages awarded were included in the judgment. Furthermore, the court's opinion detailed numerous testimonies and specifics of the case such as the hospital's knowledge of the risks associated with high oxygen levels, the lack of necessary equipment and training for medical staff, and the failure to adequately monitor and adjust Kellie's oxygen levels or consider transferring her to a more equipped facility. Additionally, the child's blindness was known to Dr. Hall before discharge, but this information was not communicated to the parents until later.","The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, modifying it to include interest on the award, but deleted $1,000 awarded to each of Phillip J. Birchfield and Mary Jo Birchfield for shock and emotional trauma. This was predicated on the fact that such damages are effectively encompassed within the term ""mental anguish,"" which had already been assessed by the jury. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in regards to its evidentiary rulings, refusal to disqualify attorneys as requested, nor its judgment concerning exhibited physical evidence and testimony related to negligence, proximate cause, and gross negligence. 

There was sufficient legal and factual evidence presented at the trial to substantiate claims of negligence in the care Kellie Birchfield received, which included the hospital's acknowledged inadequacies and refusal to upgrade nursery facilities, despite available funds and external warnings. It was determined that the hospital's negligence resulted in the administering of excessive supplemental oxygen without appropriate monitoring of blood gases, leading to Kellie's blindness, and a failure to obtain informed consent from the Birchfields regarding the risks. The court also held that there was objective and subjective evidence of gross negligence by the hospital, justifying the award for mental anguish to Kellie's parents, who were initially unaware of her condition upon discharge from the hospital.

Moreover, the court validated damages for the impaired parent-child relationship, as such damages recognize the lost experiences typically shared between parents and children. On the issue of damages for past physical pain and mental anguish, the court ruled that these should include prejudgment interest, compounded daily, from six months after Kellie's birth until the date of judgment. As for the hospital's contention about the duplicated award categories in the judgment, the court agreed and modified the judgment, ensuring that interest would begin from the date of the judgment, with specific exceptions noted.

However, the court found that the Birchfields were not entitled to both treble damages under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act and exemplary damages, as these remedies would amount to a double recovery for punitive damages stemming from the same conduct. Because the Birchfields failed to elect which remedy they sought, the court allowed only one measure of damages to stand. The calculation of prejudgment interest was further detailed, using a 10.79 percent rate compounded daily for the specific period leading up to the judgment, thereby adding to the affirmed recovery amount.

Lastly, the court took care to address whether certain instructions and issues presented to the jury might have constituted a comment on the weight of the evidence or mislead the jury. It concluded that although the wording of the gross negligence issue was not recommended, the jury was unlikely to have misinterpreted it.

"Charles Crump had received a kidney transplant in 1975 and was under a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressant drug therapy. In May 2000, while working for Frito-Lay, he sustained a knee injury resulting in a contusion and a hematoma. Following a series of health complications requiring hospitalizations, Crump died in January 2001. His wife, Joyce Crump, applied for workers' compensation death benefits, alleging the knee injury was a producing cause of his death. After administrative proceedings concluded in favor of Joyce Crump, the insurance carrier, Transcontinental Insurance Company, sought judicial review. During the trial, Transcontinental contended the May 2000 injury was not a producing cause of Crump's death. Their expert, Dr. Judson Hunt, testified that Crump's existing immunosuppressed state and health conditions, independent of his work injury, caused his death. Conversely, Dr. John Daller, Crump's treating physician, testified that the work injury was a producing cause of Crump's death, stating the injury led to an infection which compounded Crump's existing health issues, causing organ failure and death. Ultimately, the jury found the knee injury was a producing cause of death and awarded attorney's fees to Joyce Crump. Transcontinental appealed, arguing Daller's testimony was unreliable for being based on differential diagnosis, objecting to the definition of ""producing cause"" the jury was given, and disputing the manner in which attorney's fees were determined. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision, and Transcontinental then sought further review.","The Texas Supreme Court held that there were three key errors with the trial court’s proceedings. Firstly, the expert medical causation testimony from Dr. Daller, Crump's treating physician, was considered legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict since his use of differential diagnosis was deemed a reliable foundation for his testimony. This would affirm his testimony's credibility and thus sustain the finding that the jury could have reasonably believed that the knee injury was a producing cause of his death. Secondly, the Court found it was reversible error for the jury to be instructed without a 'but-for' component included in the definition of ""producing cause."" Predictively, the Supreme Court will likely conclude that the term ""producing cause"" should be defined accurately as a substantial factor in bringing about an injury or death and without which the death would not have occurred. The Court will emphasize that the omission of the but-for component was harmful because it led the jury to potentially render an incorrect verdict on the sole issue of causation. Therefore, the Supreme Court will hold that this charge error warrants a new trial. Thirdly, the Texas Supreme Court will determine that when a factual dispute exists regarding reasonable and necessary attorney's fees under Texas Labor Code § 408.221(c), an insurance carrier has the right to have a jury trial on the contested amount. In this case, Transcontinental Insurance Company will have the right to a jury trial on the amount of attorney's fees because those fees were in dispute. This means the manner in which attorney's fees were determined was improvidently done by the trial court as the decision should have been reserved for a jury's determination. 

In conclusion, the Texas Supreme Court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial, in light of the erroneous jury instruction regarding ""producing cause"" and the misplaced determination of attorney's fees without utilizing a jury for that factual dispute. The sustaining of Dr. Daller’s testimony, while leaving room for a different result on retrial, nonetheless will uphold the legal sufficiency of his causation evidence in accordance with existing legal standards for expert testimony."
"Judith Weathersby sued Dr. Rex M. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association to recover damages for injuries she claims to have sustained as a result of alleged negligence during a post-hire physical examination. After being hired by ACS Industries, Inc., Weathersby underwent her employer-mandated physical examination conducted by Dr. Crago at MacGregor, a professional association of physicians. The examination included various tests, and during a Dynatron test—an evaluation of physical strength requiring the patient to pull upwards on a stationary bar—Weathersby strained her back.

Weathersby's lawsuit alleges that Dr. Crago’s negligence in administering the Dynatron test resulted in a spine compression fracture. However, Dr. Crago and MacGregor countered the allegations by moving for summary judgment on the basis that Weathersby’s claim fell under medical negligence, requiring her to prove duty, a breach of the standard of care, injury, and that the breach proximately caused the injury. 

According to the defendants, Dr. Crago complied with the standard of care, owed Weathersby no duty, and did not cause her injuries. Dr. Crago noted that x-rays taken the day after the test did not reveal a compression fracture but diagnosed her with a muscle spasm. He further testified regarding his compliance with the standard of care and argued that the injuries were not proximately caused by his treatment. He additionally supported his defense by pointing out that hundreds of other patients had taken the Dynatron test without injury before and after Weathersby's test.

The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and Weathersby appealed claiming that the trial court erred because the summary judgment addressed a medical malpractice claim rather than a claim of ordinary negligence.","The court will affirm the summary judgment for Dr. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association due to the appellants' failure to prove proximate cause. The defendants negated the essential proximate cause element, which consists of cause in fact and foreseeability. Dr. Crago successfully presented undisputed evidence negating cause in fact by testifying that the treatment did not cause or contribute to Weathersby’s alleged injuries or damages. Specifically, he referenced Weathersby's medical questionnaire and her current medical conditions, asserting complications developed independently of the Dynatron test. As for foreseeability, Dr. Crago’s expert affidavit negated this prong, attesting to the safety and appropriateness of the test, the lack of previous injuries during similar tests, Weathersby’s absence of back trouble, and the passive nature of the exercise, which rendered her injuries unforeseeable. 

Since Dr. Crago and MacGregor disproved both elements of proximate cause (cause in fact and foreseeability) and as the plaintiff did not respond with a controverting affidavit under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c), the court will determine that Weathersby failed to create a fact issue on proximate cause, leading to the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of Dr. Crago or MacGregor. Therefore, Weathersby's points of error will be overruled and the trial court judgment will be affirmed."
"Kevin Schronk and his son Dustin filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Burleson and Laerdal Medical Corporation after emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the city-employed emergency services could not revive Kevin's wife, Helen, using an AED made by Laerdal. On the incident day, the AED failed because the battery was insufficiently charged to deliver the necessary defibrillating shock, despite several attempts leading to Helen's death.

The survivors charged the City with negligence due to the improper AED maintenance and violations of statutes related to emergency service providers, specifically Texas Health & Safety Code Ann. § 779.003. They contended that Laerdal was negligent in various aspects of manufacturing, marketing, and labeling the AED, as well as in training City staff on its operation and maintenance. They also asserted product liability claims against Laerdal, alleging the AED was unreasonably dangerous.

The City responded with a plea to the jurisdiction, arguing sovereign immunity and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction as the City had not waived this immunity. Laerdal filed a motion for summary judgment claiming there was no evidence for the claims against it and that the AED was not defective or a contributing factor to Helen's death. The trial court granted the City's plea to jurisdiction, Laerdal's motion for summary judgment, and sustained the City's objections to some evidence offered by the Schronks.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision, including the grant of the City's plea to the jurisdiction and Laerdal's motion for summary judgment. Concerning the plea to jurisdiction, the appellate court will find that the trial court erred because there exist disputed material facts regarding whether the City's use of the AED was a proximate cause of Helen's death, and whether the City failed to comply with applicable emergency action laws. Specifically, it will highlight evidence suggesting the City may have violated statutes by not adhering to the manufacturer's maintenance guidelines, thus removing the City from the exceptions of sovereign immunity protection under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Ann. §§ 101.055(2) and 101.062(b).

Regarding the summary judgment in favor of Laerdal, the appellate court will find that genuine issues of material fact remain about whether the AED and its battery were defective—factoring in potential AED malfunctions and mislabeled battery replacement dates—and whether Laerdal's supposed negligence in advising battery lifespans and failing to label batteries correctly could have proximately caused Helen Schronk's death. The court will discount Laerdal's contentions that Dr. Reese's affidavit is not substantiated because the affidavit, according to the court, is based on types of data reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.

Therefore, the case will be remanded back to the trial court for further proceedings, taking into account the evidence suggesting potential proximate causes for Helen Schronk's death tied to the City and Laerdal's actions or failures to act."
"The case involves an action initiated by the plaintiff, the estate of a deceased employee, Ruben A. Short, against the defendant, a railroad company, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA, 45 U.S.C.S. §§ 51-59). The employee was killed in a train crash near Eagle Ford, Texas. The engineer operating the train, T. B. Petty, had not qualified according to the company’s rules before taking charge of the engine. The employee inaccurately informed the engineer that the turnout was just west of Dallas when it was actually just west of Eagle Ford. The train approached a curved track at the turnout at an excessive speed, leading to the crash. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the estate after finding that the railroad company was negligent on multiple counts, including failing to ensure the engineer qualified, running the train at a dangerous speed, not informing the engineer about a track change, not maintaining a signboard to indicate the curve, and providing incorrect information in a time-table. The jury also found the employee’s failure to read a bulletin board about the turnout's location to not be contributory negligence and not the proximate cause of the injury. The trial court's refusal to submit the issue of the employee’s assumption of risk to the jury was considered harmless error.","In predicting the outcome, the Verdict will likely affirm the decision of the trial court, citing several reasons. The court will probably rule that contributory negligence was not conclusively established as a matter of law, and therefore, a peremptory instruction would not be justified. The employee's failure to read a bulletin about the turnout location will not constitute contributory negligence because foreseeing injury from such omission as a matter of law is unjustifiable. The court will also dismiss the argument that the employee’s incorrect statement to the engineer about the turnout location was a proximate cause of the crash, as the mistake did not demonstrate a failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. Additionally, because the employee stated he did not have knowledge of the turnout location, the court will likely find no duty on his part to have known its exact position.

Regarding assumed risk, the court will possibly determine there was no issue to submit to the jury since at least one of the negligence grounds was not associated with assumed risk evidence. Specifically, the failure to maintain a warning sign was not an assumed risk, as the employee had no knowledge of the turnout location. In addition, the court will likely conclude any error in refusing to submit the issue of assumed risk to the jury would be inconsequential.

On the issue of warnings about proximate cause, the court will probably rule that its definition as ""efficient and producing cause but for which the injury would not have happened and which could have been reasonably foreseen as causing the injuries complained of, or some similar injury"" was adequate. The court is anticipated to find explanations for the meaning of legal terms like ""efficient cause"" and ""efficient and producing cause"" unnecessary for the jury to render their verdict, and that such terms do not differ in their legal connotation from their common understanding.

Unless an argument or error could be definitively identified as having influenced the outcome of the trial, the court will likely not reverse judgment on the grounds of improper argument or action by the trial court or counsel. Thus, the verdict will probably conclude that no reversible error has been demonstrated, and as a result, the court's decision will be to affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff."
"Denise Castaneda sought damages from Provident American Insurance Company for alleged violations of the Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) due to the denial of her insurance claim. Denise was covered under a family insurance policy that her father, Guillermo Castaneda Sr., had purchased in May 1991. The policy contained two relevant limitations: that illnesses manifesting within 30 days from the policy's effective date were not covered, and diseases or disorders of specific internal organs, including the gallbladder, were excluded unless the loss occurred six months after the policy’s effective date. Denise and her brother exhibited yellow skin throughout their lives, and in July 1991, within 30 days of the policy taking effect, they were diagnosed with hereditary hemolytic spherocytosis (HS) which led to gallstones. Their claims were denied initially due to the six-month gallbladder exclusion but were later denied on the basis that HS had manifested within the 30-day waiting period. Multiple communication attempts were made by Denise's family and doctors to dispute the denial, all of which were denied or remained unacknowledged.","The court will reverse the appellate court's verdict on the grounds that the evidence presented was legally insufficient to support the findings that the insurance company had no reason to deny Denise Castaneda's claim, or that the insurer's liability was reasonably clear. The analysis will hinge upon the understanding that ""manifestation"" of an illness, relative to the policy's exemptions, does not necessarily mean that the insured had to be aware of the illness for it to manifest. Since both Denise and her brother had exhibited yellow skin and various symptoms before the healthcare policy was enacted, and given the details provided about the uncle's diagnosis within the 30-day period, there is a substantiated argument that HS manifested within the precluded window. Thus, it is predictable that a reasonable insurer could have decided to deny Denise's claims, especially considering the provided timelines and information available to the insurer at the time of denial. Furthermore, the testimony of Denise Castaneda, indicating she had been denied credit cards, is legally insufficient to support a claim for loss of credit reputation due to the absence of evidence proving that the denial of her claim directly resulted in injury or financial harm, such as the inability to obtain loans or incur higher interest rates. As there is no evidence of bad faith or other legal violations by the insurer, and with no findings of liability based on the theories submitted to the jury, the court will render judgment in favor of the insurer, indicating that Castaneda will not recover any damages."
"In May 2018, Jaime Montoya, Sr., an employee of Pepe Le'Pew Oilfield Rental, was working at RSP Permian's Johnson Ranch wellsite No. 1022MS in Martin County. He was there to operate a pump and tank for his employer. Consultant Don Frank Thomas saw the decedent working upon arrival at the well, but left the site for about fifteen to twenty minutes. Upon Thomas's return, he found the decedent ""slumped over"" and initiated CPR after not finding a pulse. The appellants, Maria Montoya, Jaime Montoya, Jr., and Javier Montoya, survivors of Jaime Montoya, Sr., filed suit alleging his death was due to inhaling hydrogen sulfide gas attributable to the appellees' negligence.

The appellants claimed various acts of negligence predicated on the assertion that hydrogen sulfide inhalation caused the decedent's death. They argued evidence spoliation occurred, contending that the hydrogen sulfide monitor provided to them was not the one decedent wore at his death; Thomas moved the body from the original location; and that Thomas and a Pepe Le'Pew representative influenced the justice of the peace not to perform an autopsy. No autopsy was performed at death, and the justice of the peace ruled natural causes. Over thirty days post-embalming, Dr. Thomas Parsons performed a ""private autopsy"" but did not find evidence of death by hydrogen sulfide and pointed to cardiovascular disease indications.

Evidence showed that Thomas did not smell hydrogen sulfide, his monitor did not go off, nor did decedent’s monitor or others’ respond when decedent was found. The well was shut in, to prevent gas flow. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Pepe Le'Pew for not providing adequate hydrogen sulfide hazard training, referencing the date and location of the decedent's death, but did not conclude hydrogen sulfide caused the death. OSHA cause of death was ""undetermined"".","Considering the detailed background of the case, the court was likely to affirm the trial court’s decision to grant no-evidence motions for summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the basis that the appellants could not demonstrate with evidence that the decedent’s death was caused by hydrogen sulfide exposure. The evidence presented did not rise above speculative levels to establish a causal link between the death of Jaime Montoya, Sr., and exposure to the gas at the worksite.

The complaints of spoliation of evidence likely lacked merit because reasonable explanations were provided for all actions taken post-incident (such as Thomas performing CPR), and no abuse of discretion appeared on behalf of the trial court regarding these matters. Since the OSHA citation did not directly tie the lack of training to the decedent's death and was not admissible for common law negligence, it did not serve as sufficient evidence for a causal connection.

The court would affirm the summary judgments on grounds that there was no more than a scintilla of evidence to prove hydrogen sulfide was a cause in fact of the decedent’s death. Without evidence of proximate cause and given that the other people present were not affected, signs of the decedent’s arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a lack of alarms from hydrogen sulfide monitors, the appellants could not meet their burden to show that the exposure was a substantial factor in the death. Hence, the appellants' negligence claims lacked a causal basis, supporting the appellees' grants for summary judgment."
"Tonya M. Archibeque, as the heir of the deceased Janae Devries, filed a wrongful death and survival action against North Texas State Hospital (appellee), which is part of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Archibeque's mother, Janae Devries, was a patient at the hospital and allegedly committed suicide by using a trash bag and shoe laces. Archibeque claims that the hospital was negligent in providing Devries with the means to commit suicide, given her history of suicidal tendencies. She also alleges that the hospital employees were negligent in their monitoring of Devries during sleeping hours by failing to use a flashlight and by improperly diagnosing Devries's mental status in her medical chart.

Archibeque appealed the trial court's dismissal of her case, which was based on the hospital's plea to the jurisdiction. The hospital claimed sovereign immunity since the legislature had not consented to the suit. The court's dismissal was grounded on the hospital's assertion of sovereign immunity due to the absence of legislative consent to the action, as is required for tort liability claims against governmental entities.

In her appeal, Archibeque contends that the hospital’s sovereign immunity has been waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act because the death was caused by the use or misuse of tangible personal property, specifically the trash bag and shoe laces. The hospital’s plea was based on the allegation that it was immune from suit for tort liability since the legislature did not consent to the suit, and the court challenge was primarily to contest the hospital's sovereign immunity.","The verdict upheld the trial court’s decision that the hospital's immunity from suit had not been waived and thus, the hospital remained sovereignly immune from suit. The court will reason that Archibeque did not sufficiently allege that her mother’s death was proximately caused by the hospital's use or misuse of the tangible personal property in question. While Devries used a trash bag and shoe laces to commit suicide, the court will rule that Archibeque's arguments did not establish that the hospital's provision or use of these items proximately caused her death. The mere presence of these items in Devries's room was found to only create a condition that made suicide possible, but it was not the use of the property that led to the death. 

The court will conclude that Archibeque failed to state a claim for which immunity is waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act. Archibeque’s assertions of nonuse of property (failing to use a flashlight and improperly utilizing Devries's medical chart) will be dismissed, as nonuse of property does not support a claim under the Act. Furthermore, the detail of medical diagnosis or lack thereof on paper is not considered tangible property under the Act. The central substance of Archibeque's complaint will be determined to be the failure of the hospital staff to protect Devries from harm due to her suicidal history, rather than the use of the trash bag and shoelaces, which will not fall within the limited waiver of immunity provided by the Texas Tort Claims Act. Consequently, the court’s reasoning will maintain that Archibeque did not affirmatively establish the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, and as such, the plea to the jurisdiction was properly granted by the lower court. Archibeque’s sole point on appeal will be overruled, and the court will affirm the trial court’s judgment."
"Ethel Sawyer, the widow of Arthur P. Sawyer, and her minor son Orville Sawyer, filed a lawsuit against El Paso Electric Company for damages due to the death of Arthur Sawyer. Arthur Sawyer, employed by the electric company, was an experienced electrician and lineman engaged in work on one of the company's power line poles at the time of the fatal incident. He died from electric shocks while working alongside another lineman and co-employee, Joseph W. Watson, to make alterations to the electrical apparatus on the pole.

The work involved connecting a new transformer to a cut-out box previously connected to an old transformer by an insulated copper wire, known as a primary lead. Arthur Sawyer, who was responsible for this task, inserted the new primary lead into the cut-out box without removing the old wire first, leaving the old wire dangling from the slot.

Watson later clipped the old wire close to the slot and inserted the plug into the cut-out box, thus electrifying the wires, including the piece of copper wire left in the slot. Watson notified another worker that the current was on, which Sawyer knew as well. Shortly after, Sawyer, while scraping insulation from another wire, came into contact with the cut-out box and presumably with the exposed end of the clipped copper wire. This contact resulted in an electric shock that threw Sawyer back into a guy wire attached to the pole, which was in contact with a ground wire without a circuit breaker. Sawyer received additional shocks from this contact, resulting in his death.

The trial court found in favor of Ethel Sawyer, based on the jury's findings that the electric company was negligent in four specific ways: inserting the plug into the cut-out box, leaving an exposed live wire in the cut-out box, maintaining the guy wire without a circuit breaker, and allowing the guy wire to contact a live electric wire. Each of these acts was deemed a proximate cause of Arthur Sawyer's death. The jury also found that although Sawyer was negligent in not removing the idle wire, it was not the sole proximate cause of his death.

The electric company appealed the judgment, raising several points of error, objecting to the charge to the jury and arguing that Sawyer's own negligence was either the sole proximate cause of his death or that the negligence found on the part of the company was not a proximate cause. They also contended that assumed risk issues should have been submitted to the jury among other grounds.","Predictively, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, holding the electric company liable under Texas statutes, specifically Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 8306. This will be done even considering that Arthur Sawyer may have been guilty of contributory negligence by not removing the idle wire. The rationale for this will be based on Texas law which, at the time, did not allow contributory negligence to serve as a full defense against employer negligence in worker's injuries or deaths. 

The court will reject the appellant's argument that Sawyer's failure to remove the old primary lead was solely and proximately responsible for his injury and death because it was only one of several acts of negligence that caused the incident. The court will likely support the idea that several acts of negligence can each be proximate causes of an injury and that it is usually a fact for the jury to determine which negligent act was a proximate cause of the injury. 

Additionally, the court will dismiss the electric company's argument about the negligence of Sawyer being a sufficient proximate cause by clarifying the difference between ""the proximate cause"" and ""a proximate cause."" It will emphasize that for a defense to be valid under the statute, Sawyer's negligence would have had to be the sole proximate cause, which the jury did not find.

Regarding the appellant's contention about assumed risk, the court will uphold that the defense of assumed risk has been abolished by statute in the context of workers' compensation and is, therefore, not applicable. 

Lastly, the court will respond to other points of error raised by the appellant, such as the insertion of the word ""sole"" in certain jury instructions and the refusal to submit certain special issues to the jury. The court will conclude that the instructions given were legally sound and that the jury was not misdirected by the inclusion of terms like ""sole"" in the instructions related to proximate cause.

In summary, given the detailed background information, the court's ruling will likely be highly technical, considering the various legal nuances, particularly concerning proximate cause, contributory negligence, and assumed risk under the relevant Texas statutes."
"The appellant insurer brought a case to review a decision made by the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which ruled in favor of the appellee beneficiary regarding a life insurance policy claim. The insured, George Isham Baldwin, experienced a severe fall on July 8, 1921, at his residence in Dallas, resulting in a head injury, bruises, and prolonged unconsciousness. Despite his suffering from Bright's disease, a history of partial paralysis, and an advanced age of approximately 58 years, he had maintained an active lifestyle prior to the fall. The insured passed away on August 1, 1921, but the insurer was not notified of the injury or death until December 21, 1921. The insurance policy included a clause requiring notice of injury or death within ten days of the incident, and stipulated a forfeiture of claims if not reported within the specified time. Moreover, it stated that no payment would be made for cases of death caused, wholly or partially, by disease.

At trial, testimonies conflicted regarding the cause of death, with Dr. William S. Baldwin (insured’s twin brother and a physician) attributing his death directly to the fall, while Dr. E. B. Brannin (the attending physician) suggested the primary cause as terminal pneumonia, exacerbated by the fall injury. The jury found the injuries sustained from the fall were the proximate cause of death, ruling out other diseases as a factor, and specifically including terminal pneumonia in this exclusion. The jury answered all relevant issues favorably to the appellee. The appellant insurer contended that no recovery should be made due to a lack of timely notice and absence of evidence supporting death by injury. The case also involved the scrutiny of a policy clause against the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5714(3)5C, which invalidates any policy stipulation requiring notice of a claim for damages within less than 90 days as a condition precedent to the right to sue.","Considering the extensive facts presented, the court will likely affirm the trial court’s judgment in favor of the appellee beneficiary. The court will reason that the policy provision requiring notice within ten days as a condition precedent to the right to sue is invalid under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5714(3)5C, and must be construed as if no such time frame was specified. Given that the policy’s notice clause is void and cannot be enforced, the delay in providing notification to the appellant insurer cannot serve as grounds for denying the claim. Furthermore, considering the evidence provided during the trial, specifically Dr. William S. Baldwin’s testimony combined with the insured's compromised consciousness post-fall, the court will regard the jury’s decision that the injury was the proximate cause of death as justifiable.

With respect to the cause of death, the court will determine that the evidence supports the jury's finding that the assured’s death was solely and directly caused by the injury from the fall. Despite the insured's prior medical conditions, the injury's immediate consequences will be considered distinct and influential in leading to his death. The court will rule that the testimony given by Dr. Baldwin is sufficient to establish an issue of fact, and the jury’s decision—based on said testimony and the circumstances following the injury—was within their discretion to conclude that the injury led to the insured’s death. Given this assessment and analysis of the testimonies and the relevant statutory law, the court will uphold the jury’s verdict, rejecting the insurer's arguments related to the policy’s notice requirements and the causation of the insured's death."
"Marcos Rios was employed by A Guardian Angel Child Care Center, Inc. (the ""Appellant"") as a van driver whose job was to transport children to and from the daycare center. On January 28, 2013, Rios was exposed to fumes from a fire extinguisher that accidentally discharged in the vehicle. Following this incident, Rios began experiencing respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, a scratchy throat, and ultimately respiratory failure, leading to Rios requiring a permanent tracheostomy. Rios subsequently sued his employer for negligence, claiming that the facility's failure to properly secure the fire extinguisher, lack of employee training, and provision of an unsafe workplace caused his injuries. At trial, Rios provided lay testimony about the accident and his resultant symptoms, but did not present expert medical testimony explicitly linking his medical conditions to the fire extinguisher incident. He also introduced his medical records and bills, attributing the entirety of his medical expenses to the incident without segregating charges for respiratory care from other treatments. Rios won at trial, with the jury awarding him damages that included full compensation for past medical expenses, mental anguish, disfigurement, lost earnings, and lost earning capacity.","The appellate court reversed the trial court’s judgment and concluded that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that the fire extinguisher incident caused all of Rios’s claimed medical expenses. Expert medical testimony was necessary to establish proximate causation for many of the medical conditions and treatments, particularly since Rios was diagnosed with and treated for multiple chronic health conditions unrelated to respiratory issues. The court looked favorably upon the evidence relating to the time period between January 28, 2013, and February 28, 2013, during which Rios received treatment for his respiratory problems, assessing that only those conditions commonly known to relate to respiratory distress could be causally linked to the incident based on lay testimony. The court also noted that Rios's medical records did not segregate charges directly caused by the fire extinguisher incident from charges for other treatments or illnesses. As a result, it was nearly impossible for a jury to accurately determine which medical expenses were directly tied to Rios's respiratory issues resulting from the fire extinguisher exposure. Therefore, while the lay testimony supported some damages, the absence of expert medical testimony rendered the lay testimony legally insufficient to support the full amount awarded by the jury for past medical expenses.

Given that there was evidence to support some damages, the court indicated that Rios should be given another opportunity to develop the evidence further through a new trial on both liability and damages. A new trial on both liability and damages was deemed necessary due to the contested liability issues in the case. Thus, the court remanded for a new trial consistent with their opinion."
"Appellant patient, Doris Penrod, appealed a take-nothing judgment entered in favor of appellee doctor, David R. Schecter, M.D., Individually, and d/b/a Schecter and Blumenfeld, P.A., following a jury trial on her medical malpractice claim.

The case stemmed from an eye injury Penrod sustained on August 6, 2003, when she was scheduled for cataract surgery on her left eye with Dr. Schecter. An anesthesiologist administered a retrobulbar injection of anesthesia, causing a small retrobulbar hemorrhage (RBH) in Penrod's eye. This is a rare complication, with an even smaller percentage posing a risk to the optic nerve. Dr. Schecter observed no change in the RBH and did not use a tonometer to measure intraocular pressure, choosing instead to cancel the surgery due to potential complications.

Penrod was discharged with instructions and returned the following morning experiencing bruising, no vision, and significant pain. Dr. Schecter diagnosed a rebleed and prescribed medications to lower intraocular pressure. Penrod did not improve and was later diagnosed with ischemic optic atrophy, which can be caused by RBH.

At trial, Penrod's expert witness contended that the standard of care required measurement of intraocular pressure and vision evaluation. Dr. Schecter's expert disagreed, asserting that the practice was to evaluate by clinical observation, which indicated no need for further immediate intervention.

During the charge conference at trial, there was an error introduced in the jury instructions concerning proximate cause: the inclusion of unrelated ""new and independent cause"" language. Penrod objected but was cut off by the court, and the mistake was carried into the jury's instructions. The jury found no negligence proximately causing the injury. Penrod filed a motion for a new trial based on this error, which was rejected by the trial court.","The court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial. Proximate cause instruction will be critically reassessed because the inclusion of ""unbroken by any new and independent cause"" was found by the appellate court to be erroneous and unsupported by evidence. There was no proof that Penrod's post-discharge rebleed was independent of the original alleged negligence. The jury should have been exclusively guided by the definition and relationship of direct causation regarding Dr. Schecter's actions.

The error will likely be considered harmful for appeal purposes, as it relates to a contested, critical issue—causation—and defense counsel's argument regarding the new and independent cause was one that could only have been made due to the defective proximate cause instruction. Furthermore, the appellate court will probably consider the introduction of the flawed language into the charge to constitute harmful error as it provided the jury with an inappropriate basis to find that the negligence of Dr. Schecter, if any, did not proximately cause Doris Penrod's injury.

The provision of a flawed instruction regarding proximate cause will be seen on appeal as misleading to the jury, allowing them to improperly consider factors outside the direct evidence and testimony presented. The error gave the appellant an unintended defensive argument that shifted the jury's focus from evaluating whether Dr. Schecter breached the standard of care directly causing the injury, to considering an unfounded 'new and independent cause.' Therefore, the jury's consideration of causation was based on a legally incorrect standard. As such, reversing and remanding for a new trial will be deemed necessary to ensure a verdict based on a correct understanding and application of the law to the facts presented, which could provide the appellant with a fair reevaluation of the evidence in light of properly articulated legal standards."
"Harley R. Walker, the respondent property owner, initiated legal proceedings against several insurance companies—Houston Fire and Casualty Company and two others (the petitioners)—based on Builders Risk Insurance policies. Walker's claim involved damage to a reinforced concrete dam, which he asserted was caused by lightning. However, the insurance policies in question described Walker's brick veneer dwelling and did not include the concrete dam that was reportedly destroyed. Consequently, Walker sought a reformation of the policies, alleging mutual mistake, to encompass the dam. The insurance companies countered with a general denial, attributing the dam's damage to flood waters, not lightning, and contended that the dam was not covered under the policy's terms.

The trial court sided with the insurance companies, resulting in a judgment that Walker receive nothing. Walker then appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals based only on the trial court transcript, proclaiming that a statement of facts was unnecessary for an appellate decision. The insurance companies prepared a statement of facts, which was initially accepted by the appellate court, but later, an order was issued rescinding the acceptance of the statement of facts. The appellate court subsequently adjudged in favor of Walker based solely on the transcript, reforming the policies and issuing a judgment for the amount determined by the jury. The determination was based on the view that, according to the verdict, Walker was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

In response to the appellate court judgment, the insurers appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate court's decision to reverse the trial court's judgment based only on the transcript was erroneous, with several special issues decided by the trial court not being properly considered. The contention was that without a statement of facts, the appellate court should not have reversed the trial court’s judgment. Walker continued to maintain that the appellate court’s review should be based only on the trial transcript.

The Supreme Court’s review focused on the procedural aspects of the case instead of a full record, due to the absence of a statement of facts and because that was the central issue presented by the parties. The trial court's special issues and jury's answers indicated that the jury believed a tree near the dam was struck by lightning, but that the tree was not expelled from the ground by the strike, which might have been necessary for the tree to have caused the damage to the dam. The Court of Civil Appeals considered Special Issue No. 3, about the tree being expelled from the ground, to be immaterial, thus disregarding it and holding that respondents were entitled to judgment on the other issues.","The Supreme Court is slated to reverse the appellate court's judgment that rested solely on the trial transcript. The reversal will be based on the principle that without a statement of facts, an appellate court usually cannot and should not overturn a trial court's judgment. Specifically, in this instance, it's expected that the Supreme Court will hold that the appellate court erred in deeming Special Issue No. 3 as immaterial and in excluding it from consideration, as this was indeed a material issue based on the trial judge's submission of evidence and the importance of the issue in establishing causation for the damage.

The Supreme Court will likely emphasize the importance of the special issues decided by the jury—especially the negative response to Special Issue No. 3—which was central to establishing whether the tree’s being struck by lightning was a proximate cause of the damage to the dam. The lack of evidence supporting the jury's affirmative response to Special Issue No. 4, in light of the negative response to No. 3, will be highlighted, underscoring the principle that an appellate court cannot declare a trial court's finding that an issue was unsupported by evidence to be incorrect in the absence of a statement of facts.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court will conclude that the trial court implicitly found the causation evidence sufficient only for Special Issue No. 3, and when the jury answered it negatively, it left no evidence to support an affirmative answer to Special Issue No. 4. The decision will affirm the trial court's judgment of ""take nothing"" in favor of the insurers because the evidence on causation—an essential element of Walker's claim—was not found sufficient by the jury, thereby not warranting reformation of the insurance policies to include the dam. The Supreme Court's decision will validate the trial court's judgment as procedurally sound given the absence of a statement of facts to review."
"Petitioner parents, Tom and Gloria Nelson, brought an action for wrongful birth and wrongful life against respondents, Dr. Edward Krusen and Baylor University Medical Center, after Dr. Krusen advised them that Mrs. Nelson was not a carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and, consequentially, their potential child was not at an increased risk of being affected by the disease. Based on this advice, the Nelsons decided not to terminate the pregnancy, and their child, Mark Nelson, was born on November 24, 1976. Shortly after his third birthday, Mark was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The Nelsons filed suit alleging that if they had known of the risk of the disease, they would have terminated the pregnancy. They also claimed that the hospital had conducted or reported certain tests negligently, contributing to the misinformation provided by Dr. Krusen. The trial court, however, rendered summary judgment for Dr. Krusen and Baylor on the grounds that the two-year statute of limitations had run on the wrongful birth claim, and that no cause of action for wrongful life existed in Texas. The court of appeals affirmed this decision before the Nelsons further appealed.

The Texas Supreme Court, upon reviewing the appeal, focused on two major issues:

1. *Statute of Limitations*: The defendants contended that the Nelsons' actions were barred as they were not brought within two years of the last examination by Dr. Krusen, based on the limitations period prescribed by article 5.82, section 4 of the Insurance Code.

2. *Wrongful Life*: The court needed to decide whether the child, through his next friend, could assert a separate cause of action for ""wrongful life,"" arguing that Dr. Krusen's negligence was the proximate cause of his birth with muscular dystrophy.

The court considered whether enforcing such a limitations period as is would be unconstitutional, specifically in relation to the ""open courts"" provision of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees remedy by due course of law. The Nelsons contended that this guarantee makes any legislative attempt to bar their cause of action prior to its discovery unconstitutional.

The court examined previous decisions construing the open courts provision, the principles of which establish that imposition of an impossible condition, such as barring a cause of action before the party knows or reasonably should know they have been injured, is unconstitutional. The limitation period of article 5.82, section 4, if applied as written, would thus contravene these principles by requiring the Nelsons to sue before they had any reason to know they should sue.","The Texas Supreme Court held the two-year statute of limitations unconstitutional under the open courts provision to the extent it purported to cut off an injured person's right to sue before they had a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit. It was concluded that article I, section 13 prohibits the legislature from denying a remedy by due course of law, and it cannot operate to bar a parent's cause of action before they knew it existed or could reasonably have discovered it within two years.

For the parents' wrongful birth claim, the statute's application was deemed unreasonable and arbitrary, as it would cut off their cause of action before it was possible to discover their injury. The existence of a ""wrongful birth"" cause of action was upheld under Texas law, recognizing that parents may recover for the care and treatment of their child's impairment when caused by a physician who has negligently failed to inform them of the risk of such an impairment.

However, the court affirmed the judgment that there is no cause of action for wrongful life in Texas, thus denying the separate suit brought on behalf of Mark Nelson. The court reasoned that compared to the claim of the parents, the wrongful life claim would require weighing the benefits of life against the detriments of an impaired life--a calculation deemed rationally unresolvable. The idea of assessment of damages is predicated upon the notion that but for the negligence, the plaintiff would have been in a condition different from the actual one post-negligence. In a wrongful life case, such comparison was deemed nonsensical, as it would require comparing an impaired life to nonexistence.

Therefore, the Supreme Court reversed the part of the judgment affirming summary judgment on the wrongful birth claim and remanded the case for trial, while also affirming the determination that prevents the recognition of wrongful life claims under Texas law."
"The husband of a woman who swallowed glass from a bottle of soda produced by the Texas Coca-Cola Bottling Company filed a lawsuit to recover damages for his wife's injuries. The wife had consumed the soda, discovered broken glass inside, and was purportedly injured as a result. A trial court jury found the company negligent and liable for the injuries she sustained. The company appealed the judgment. They argued firstly that the jury should not have been informed about the company carrying indemnity insurance, which was disclosed during cross-examination. However, the court noted that such a revelation was volunteered by the defense, excusing the issue. The main contention of the appeal was whether the award for pain, suffering, and incapacity could include issues relating to pre-existing conditions the wife might have had. The husband confirmed she had had several operations prior to the incident but claimed she was healthy at the time of the glass ingestion. The company maintained that some of the wife's suffering was related to these prior conditions unrelated to the incident. Ultimately, the jury awarded the plaintiff $15,125, deciding the physical suffering was not solely due to previous health issues.","The appellate court reversed the trial court decision. The judges will likely conclude that the instructions given to the jury failed to adequately guide them to consider whether a portion of the wife's suffering and incapacity was attributable to pre-existing conditions that were not aggravated by swallowing glass.  Despite the jury finding that the suffering was not solely due to previous disease, the appellate court will reconcile this with the evidence suggesting that at least some health issues could have predated and existed independently of the incident. The testimony from medical professionals about the expected healing process for a cut in the stomach and the fact that ulcers are not commonly caused by ingesting foreign objects will be particularly persuasive. The court will emphasize that the defendant should only be liable for pain and incapacities caused by negligence (i.e., the glass ingestion), excluding those stemming from any pre-existing conditions unless those conditions were exacerbated by the incident.

The court will reference the Texas Supreme Court precedent set forth in the Ector case, offering clear guidance: where evidence raises an issue that part of claimed injuries could be due to pre-existing conditions, specific jury instructions should exclude damages related to those pre-existing conditions not aggravated by the defendant's negligence. As such, they will argue that standard explanations or definitions for damages should exclude those components not attributable to the defendant's actions, providing further context to the jury.

The verdict will similarly draw upon additional cases cited in the background illustrating the required precision in jury instructions to isolate damages directly linked to the alleged negligence from those which might stem from a previous or unrelated condition. Hence, the appellate court will assert that the trial court erred by not providing explicit instructions to the jury to evaluate and omit elements of damages unrelated to the glass ingestion. 

The reversal will lead to the appellate court remanding the case for further proceedings, potentially including a retrial where the jury will be properly instructed on what damages they can consider based on the defendant's proven negligence."
"Clodus B. Wright, the appellant insured, was covered under a policy by The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, the appellee insurer, which agreed to pay him $5,000.00 for the loss of a foot ""solely as a result of accidental bodily injury sustained or disease contracted while this policy is in force."" While the policy was active, Wright's leg had to be amputated due to gangrene, which developed as a result of a gunshot wound he incurred during a robbery at the Brook Hollow Country Club. Wright argued that he was entitled to the policy benefits, as his leg's amputation—the loss of his foot—was solely due to the gangrene, a disease contracted while the policy was in effect. Wright also contended that the policy's language did not preclude coverage for loss due to disease contracted from an injury obtained during a robbery.

The insurance company maintained that Wright should have reasonably expected to be shot and injured given his involvement in the robbery, consequently deeming the injury not accidental. Additionally, they argued that the gunshot wound, not just the gangrene, was a proximate cause of the amputation, disqualifying the loss from being solely due to a disease. Both parties motioned for a summary judgment. The 116th District Court of Dallas County granted summary judgment to the insurance company, concluding that Wright was not entitled to recover under the policy and ordered that he take nothing.","The appellate court is predicted to affirm the lower court's decision, upholding the award of summary judgment to the appellee insurer and ruling that the appellant insured take nothing. It will likely be reasoned that, based on the stipulated facts, Wright should have reasonably anticipated the potential of being shot during the robbery, which negates the argument that the injury was accidental. Consequently, the insurance policy's coverage requiring loss solely due to accidental bodily injury or disease contracted would not be applicable in this case.

Moreover, the court will probably determine that the gunshot wound was indeed a proximate cause of the gangrene and thus the amputation. Despite the disease being the immediate reason for the loss of the foot, the resulting condition cannot be separated from the prior injury that was self-inflicted during an unlawful act. Since the policy specifies that the insurer would pay for losses resulting solely from accidental injuries or diseases, and given that the gunshot wound—deemed not accidental due to the circumstances—contributed to the need for amputation, the condition for coverage as per the policy is not met.

The court's reasoning will likely include the stance that the presence of the gunshot wound as a contributing factor disqualifies the loss from being solely due to the gangrene, and therefore, based on the contract terms and applicable legal precedents, the appellant's loss was not solely from disease. The court will find no merit in Wright's claim that gangrene should be considered an independent cause, and consequently, his recovery under the policy is unsubstantiated by the contract terms and established law. As a result, the judgment for the appellee insurer will be affirmed, and Wright's appeal dismissed."
"On October 22, 1963, Elma Gravis experienced abdominal pain, for which her husband, C. K. Gravis Jr., contacted Dr. Philip S. Joseph. Meeting at the emergency room of the Physicians & Surgeons Hospital of Alice, Texas, Mrs. Gravis received an examination and pain medication, followed by observation. Further examinations and tests were conducted, inclusive of X-rays and various medications, like sedatives, antibiotics, and pain relievers. On October 24, an emergency exploratory surgery was performed to address an intestinal obstruction, during which Mrs. Gravis received spinal anesthetic and pentothal sodium. Post-surgery, Mrs. Gravis developed permanent disabilities, including bladder issues, phlebitis of the left leg, and partial paralysis.

The Gravises sued on multiple grounds including assault and battery, fraud, duty to warn, breach of contract, administrative negligence, and various acts of negligence and malpractice. Following extensive discovery with depositions, affidavits, and other legal filings, the defendants each moved for summary judgment. The trial court held that based on the uncontroverted evidence, there was no material fact issue and thus granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment. Mrs. Gravis was the patient; Dr. Joseph was the operating physician; Dr. John C. Turnham Jr. was the assisting physician; and Ruth B. Grose was the nursing supervisor and anesthetist at the hospital.

The plaintiffs contested the summary judgment on two main points: failure to prove the absence of genuine issues of fact and improper judgment despite this alleged failure. However, during both the admission and the operation, Mrs. Gravis was heavily sedated. The evidence showed that Dr. Joseph sought and received verbal consent from Mr. Gravis for the emergency operation when Mrs. Gravis' condition deteriorated, and Mr. Gravis signed a written consent form. No objections to the operation were recorded from either Mr. or Mrs. Gravis, and the primary contention seemed to center on the specific anesthetic used, which medical evidence suggested was standard and posed an extremely rare risk.","The appellate court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. It will consider that the necessity for emergency surgery meant that informed consent was not required under the circumstances, as timely action was crucial. The notion of consent will be extended to Mr. Gravis, who agreed to the surgery under emergent conditions, and this consent will be judged to be legally sufficient. The verdict will rely on the professional medical opinions presented, which will testify that the emergency situation justified actions taken without prior express consent and that the anesthetics and medical practices employed were routine and carried negligible known risks.

The appeal will fail to prove that informed consent was necessary given the emergency nature of the surgery, which will be supported by professional standards and expectations of medical practice at the time. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' inability to present expert medical evidence linking the defendants' actions to Mrs. Gravis's injuries will be pivotal. The absence of such crucial expert testimony regarding the standard of care and proximate causation leaves no fact issue for a jury to resolve.

Therefore, the court will conclude that the plaintiffs have not met the burden of proof required in malpractice cases and that the defendants acted within the bounds of reasonable medical practice. The lack of evidence that any other physician acting under similar circumstances would have disclosed further information about the potential risks or would have acted differently will be instrumental in affirming the judgment. The verdict will clarify that an allergic reaction to anesthesia, while devastating, was unforeseeable and not a direct result of any negligence on the part of the medical staff."
"The case concerns a wrongful death and survival action brought by plaintiffs, the estate of Darla Blackmon and her daughter Sheila Shultz, against the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) after Blackmon died from pneumonia while incarcerated at a Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facility where UTMB provided medical services. Blackmon, who was undergoing alcoholism treatment, fell ill in December 2000 and sought medical attention on multiple occasions in January 2001 without being referred to a physician, ordered diagnostic tests, or receiving antibiotics. During her last visit to UTMB medical services, Nurse Lancaster used a stethoscope and pulse oxymeter to assess Blackmon's condition but sent her back to her room without detecting her severe pneumonia. Blackmon died the next morning from asphyxiation caused by untreated pneumonia. Shultz claimed a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), alleging that Blackmon's death was proximately caused by the negligent use of tangible personal property, specifically a stethoscope and pulse oxymeter. UTMB argued that Shultz did not sufficiently plead or show that the use of tangible property proximately caused the death and filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the trial court denied. UTMB appealed the decision.","The court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny UTMB's plea to the jurisdiction. In reaching this decision, the court will recognize that Shultz's claim fell within the TTCA's statutory waiver. The court will acknowledge that traditional proximate cause analysis under TTCA does not require the tangible property itself, such as the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter, to be the instrument of harm. Rather, it requires a sufficient causal nexus between the negligent use—or misuse—of such property and the victim's death. The court will emphasize that UTMB's use of the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter must be more than mere involvement with the property; it must have actually contributed causally to the death. The court will focus on whether Shultz has adequately alleged that the negligent use or misuse of the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter was a substantial factor in bringing about the death, and that, but for the negligence alleged, the pneumonia would have been detected, and Blackmon's life could have been saved.

The court will further distinguish this case from precedents where there was no direct misuse of property or where misuse did not result in harm. It will assert that the alleged negligent actions of the UTMB providers are neither too temporally attenuated from Blackmon's death nor too weak in their causal relationship to remove them from TTCA's waiver of immunity. The court will predict that the ruling will be made on the basis that the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter were tangible personal property used with the purpose of detecting the very conditions that led to Blackmon's death, and the alleged misuse of these tools nine hours before her death is alleged to have directly impacted the failure to treat her life-threatening condition, leading to the lung failure that caused her death, thereby satisfying the use-of-property criterion required by TTCA for waiver of sovereign immunity.

"Appellant, Albert Benser, doing business as Carrier Square Apartments, seeks review of a decision by the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which ruled in favor of appellee, Cynthia Johnson, and her daughter in an apartment premises negligence lawsuit. On February 1, 1983, Cynthia Johnson and her daughter moved into the appellant's apartment complex and soon discovered that the locks on their living room and bedroom windows were broken. She reported this issue to the management, who provided her with ""screw-type"" locks for both windows and a stick to secure one window. However, these measures were inadequate as the new locks did not function properly. On February 18, 1984, an intruder drilled a small hole in the living-room window, removed the stick, and entered the apartment due to the non-working lock. The intruder then raped Mrs. Johnson in the presence of her daughter. Mrs. Johnson subsequently filed a negligence lawsuit against Mr. Benser for failing to provide proper locks and security for her apartment. The jury ruled in her favor.

At trial, evidence demonstrated the appellant's knowledge of the broken locks and refusal to install working replacements, despite being aware that the complex was in a high-crime area and had experienced previous criminal activities. A police officer testified that the presence of the stick in the window could indicate to an intruder that the window was vulnerable, potentially inviting unlawful entry.

The jury was required to consider cause in fact and foreseeability to establish proximate cause. The case law suggests that a landlord may be liable if their negligence creates an opportunity for crime that is foreseeable. Federal and state court decisions in similar cases were reviewed, and they supported the premises that landlords can be held accountable for negligence that leads to criminal acts such as break-ins when they fail to take reasonable security measures, especially in high crime areas or in light of previous criminal activity on the premises.","The court will affirm the judgment as the jury's findings are not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence to the extent of being manifestly unjust. It is foreseeable that a landlord's failure to maintain secure locks, especially in a high-crime area with a history of criminal activity, could lead to criminal conduct such as burglary or assault. The appellant's prolonged negligence concerning broken locks, despite repeated complaints and awareness of the crime risks, will be considered a substantial factor in the harm suffered by the appellees. The jury could rightfully conclude that the negligence in maintaining building security directly contributed to the criminal act and the subsequent injuries sustained by the appellees.

Given the presented evidence and findings from similar cases, the court will deem the appellant's inaction to provide functional locks as the proximate cause of the appellee's injuries. Consequently, the court will find that the appellant's negligence facilitated the intruder's entry and the subsequent criminal act, upholding the trial court's ruling in favor of the appellee for damages sustained from the incident."
"Daisy Mae Simpson, a known diabetic, underwent coronary bypass surgery at the Methodist Hospital. After developing a decubitus ulcer post-operatively at Methodist, she was transferred to Select Specialty Hospital-Houston, Inc. (Select) for long-term care. Simpson later died from sepsis, which allegedly originated from the ulcer.

Deborah Wade, representing Simpson's heirs, sued Methodist and Select, claiming that the hospitals' failure to use an egg crate mattress led to Simpson developing the pressure ulcer and subsequent infection, resulting in her death. The lawsuit was filed on November 5, 2001.

The case was governed by the former Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, which required the filing of an expert report within 180 days of initiating a lawsuit, with a possible 30-day extension. Methodist filed a motion to dismiss on July 25, 2002, claiming the expert report deadline had passed, and Select followed with a similar motion.

Wade admitted to missing the deadline and requested an extension, attributing the delay to her solo-practitioner counsel's busy schedule. However, she argued that an expert report was unnecessary because the alleged negligence was within common knowledge and fell under common law negligence and res ipsa loquitur principles.

The trial court granted the hospitals' motions to dismiss, and Wade appealed, claiming: 1) the expert report should not have been required, 2) the trial court should have granted an extension, 3) the trial court failed to apply progressive sanctions before dismissing the case, and the hospitals waived their right to an expert report by engaging in discovery and waiting more than 210 days to file their motions to dismiss.","The appellate court will affirm the trial court's dismissal, basing its decision on the clear legislative requirements and prior jurisprudence regarding expert reports in medical malpractice cases. It will reject Wade's argument that the case falls within common law exceptions that do not require expert testimony. The court will find that Wade has failed to provide sufficient evidence that most people are aware of the use of an egg crate mattress to prevent bedsores and that no expert testimony is necessary.

Regarding the procedural requisites, the appellate court will determine that the trial court did not deviate from the Act's requirements. Since Wade's counsel was aware of the expert report deadline but was too occupied to meet it, this constitutes a failure to demonstrate accident, mistake, or innocence.

As to the argument of waiver, the court will conclude that neither the Act nor case law supports the idea that Methodist and Select waived their rights to dismissal by engaging in discovery or waiting to file the motion to dismiss.

For the request for extension, Wade will fail to prove an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Being inundated with work does not meet the criteria for accident or mistake necessary to grant an extension.

Finally, the court will find that Wade's contention that the trial court erred by not reinstating her claims falls short. The justification for reinstatement does not meet the legal threshold for proving mistake or accident, as the failure to file was due to her attorney being busy, which is insufficient to demonstrate absence of intentional or conscious indifference.

In conclusion, the requirement for an expert report was not met, no proper justification for an extension was provided, the hospitals did not waive their rights, and there was no procedural error by the trial court. Thus, the appellate court will uphold the judgment of the trial court to dismiss the case."
"The plaintiff insured sought recovery on an insurance policy after a windstorm struck his car while driving near Colorado City, Texas, causing the car to go off-road and crash into a post, resulting in substantial damage. The jury found that there was indeed a windstorm that proximately caused damage to the insured's car. Based on this finding and an agreement on the amount of damage ($850.00), the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. 

The insurance company defendant appealed, raising questions about the trial court’s definition of ""windstorm"" and whether the evidence and definition fit within the terms and meaning of the policy. The defendant challenged the trial court's definition, which didn't incorporate the element of wind with ""unusual, tumultuous violence"" often with little or no rainfall. The defendant also argued that the policy excluded loss caused by a collision with another object, suggesting the damage was caused by such a collision rather than a windstorm.

The plaintiff provided evidence through deposition and testimony, corroborated by his wife, that a windstorm blew the car from the road and directly into the post. There was no dispute over the facts, primarily the issue was the definition of ""windstorm."" Appellate courts from other jurisdictions defined ""windstorm"" as a wind of unusual violence without necessarily including rainfall. The policy had two relevant provisions: Coverage W excluding loss caused by collision except for exceptions such as windstorm, and Coverage F-1 covering loss due to windstorm regardless of rainfall.","The verdict of this case will affirm the judgment of the trial court based on several key points. The definition of ""windstorm"" given by the trial court will be considered sufficient to qualify the event that caused the damage as within the policy's coverage. The evidence presented showed that the windstorm was of sufficient violence and tumultuous force to be deemed a ""storm.""

Despite the defendant's objections to the trial court's definition lacking the element of ""wind with unusual, tumultuous violence,"" the appellate court will find this unnecessary for the definition of a windstorm within the given policy context. Moreover, the observed variations in windstorm characteristics across different regions and the presence (or absence) of rainfall will be seen as irrelevant to the policy coverage determination under these circumstances.

The damage to the car will be considered to have been proximately caused by the windstorm, as the wind was the moving cause of the accident, and the collision with the post was incidental and not the original cause of the damage. Additionally, the court will determine that appellant’s contentions of the damage being caused by a ""collision with another object"" are not supported by the evidence and are not upheld by the provisions of the policy that clearly state windstorm damage is not regarded as a loss caused by collision or upset.

Therefore, given the findings of the jury and the evidence being uncontradicted and supported by testimony, the court will conclude that the loss was caused by the windstorm as defined by the trial court and covered under the policy, and will overrule the defendant's objections and theories as they do not align with the evidence presented. Hence, the trial court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiff will be affirmed."
"Dorman Smith, a self-employed drywaller finisher, utilized joint compound products in his work from around 1955 to the mid-1980s. In early 2005, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma—an aggressive cancer commonly associated with asbestos exposure. Following the diagnosis, Dorman and his personal representatives, Rosemary Smith, Brady Smith, and Donna Hubbard (collectively, the Smiths), initiated a products liability lawsuit against several defendants, including Kelly-Moore Paint Company, Inc. (Kelly-Moore), alleging that Dorman's mesothelioma was proximately caused by exposure to asbestos in the defendants' joint compound products. Dorman Smith died on December 9, 2005, after the lawsuit had been filed.

The case was moved to the 11th District Court for pretrial proceedings. Kelly-Moore moved for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, maintaining that there was insufficient evidence that asbestos exposure from its products was responsible for Dorman Smith’s mesothelioma. The basis for their argument was the substantial factor causation test from the case Borg-Warner Corp. v. Flores, requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate frequent, regular, and proximate exposure to the product as well as reasonable quantitative evidence of increased risk. Following the court's decision for a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore, the case returned to the 153rd District Court for trial, but with all other claims against remaining entities either settled or dismissed, the summary judgment against Kelly-Moore stood as final, prompting the Smiths' appeal.

During the initial and appellate procedures, various pieces of evidence were presented. Dorman had worked with many brands of joint compound, including Kelly-Moore's, which he used until the mid to late 1970s—around the time Kelly-Moore removed asbestos from its products. Brady Smith testified to using Kelly-Moore ready-mixed joint compound on a ""pretty regular basis"" but less frequently than others due to its cost. Dorman's son also provided estimated percentages concerning the time spent sanding and mixing joint compound on the job.

Dr. Ronald Dodson conducted a tissue burden analysis of Dorman's lungs post-mortem, finding chrysotile fibers longer than those commonly found in the lungs of the general, non-occupationally exposed population. Patricia Hall offered an estimate of Dorman's exposure duration and fiber count, while Dr. William Longo provided fiber release measurements corresponding to typical work activities involving joint compounds. All evidence pointed towards exposure exceeding recommended limits.

Dr. Arnold Brody and Dr. John Maddox provided expert opinions on causation. Dr. Brody spoke to the general capacity of asbestos fibers, regardless of type or length, to cause genetic errors, while Dr. Maddox explicitly connected significant exposure to asbestos dust with Dorman's mesothelioma, criticizing the concept of a minimum threshold of exposure above background levels as ""logical nonsense."" Maddox also cited studies indicating that various forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are capable of causing mesothelioma.","In determining the verdict, the appellate court will uphold the trial court's judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore. The court will have noted that, while there is some evidence to suggest how often Dorman used Kelly-Moore's products, and therefore of his exposure to its compound, the Smiths will not have provided sufficient scientific evidence of a minimum threshold of exposure to chrysotile asbestos alone that poses an increased risk of developing mesothelioma. Given the precedent set in the Borg-Warner case, the court will expect the Smiths to offer a quantifiable level of exposure to Kelly-Moore's compound that could be considered a substantial factor in causing Dorman's mesothelioma.

While the Smiths will raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the Lohrmann factors (frequency, regularity, and proximity of exposure), there will have been no evidence to pinpoint a minimum threshold dose of chrysotile asbestos from Kelly-Moore's product above which mesothelioma does not occur. The absence of this crucial information will be most influential in the court's reasoning, supported by the Smiths' failure to distinguish between different asbestos types in epidemiological studies and lacking correlation in case reports and animal studies between exposure thresholds and the increased risk of mesothelioma.

Ultimately, the court will emphasize that the Borg-Warner ""substantial factor causation test"" applies to all asbestos-related claims, regardless of the asbestos disease type. Thus, without the necessary minimum exposure level evidence, expert testimonies will be seen as lacking the required foundation to raise a fact issue as to specific causation. Therefore, the Smiths' inability to establish specific causation, as required by Borg-Warner standard, will be the key to the court affirming the summary judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore."
"Mecia Motley, the plaintiff, brought a lawsuit against Texas Hotel Company of Longview and National Hotel Company, the defendants, seeking damages for injuries she sustained by jumping from a third-floor window during a fire at Hotel Longview on March 29, 1934. The case was focused on the tort of negligence, with the plaintiff claiming the defendants were negligent due to the mere existence of the fire in the hotel of unknown origin. A jury trial had been conducted, resulting in findings against both defendants.

The jury found that on the aforementioned date, Motley did sustain injuries on the occasion of the fire in the hotel. It further found that the Texas Hotel Company of Longview was not operating as an independent corporation in good faith and was under the management and control of the National Hotel Company. Additionally, the jury established that the Texas Hotel Company of Longview was the agent of the National Hotel Company in the operation of Hotel Longview.

Significantly, the jury concluded that the employees of the Hotel Longview failed to immediately call the fire department upon discovering the fire, a fact which constituted negligence and was a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Equally, facts were established that a porter's closet under the hotel’s lobby, which was under the exclusive control of the Hotel Longview management, was negligently operated—a negligence that was applied as a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.

The jury also found facts that indicated the hotel management allowed the fire to start through negligence, but it did not specifically determine if the failure to warn the guest was an act of negligence or if it was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. There were further findings that the fire did not result from an unavoidable accident and that while it was sudden and fierce, this was not the sole proximate cause of the injury to Motley.

Other elements that the jury considered included information about previous fires at the hotel, the hotel management's instructions in case of another fire, and the use of flammable construction materials, but these were not central to the jury's verdict. Contributory negligence claims were resolved in favor of the plaintiff. Damages were set at $17,680.

The defendants, both the Texas Hotel Company and the National Hotel Company, challenged the findings, suggesting that the National Hotel Company should not be deemed negligent simply for being a holding company or the potential master of an allegedly negligent subsidiary, the Texas Hotel Company. They disputed the applicability of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in the case.

The case reveals a complex interplay of corporate relationships, where the National Hotel Company's charter powers and actions were scrutinized to determine whether it was indeed the entity conducting the hotel business through the Texas Hotel Company as a front. Evidence relating to corporate control, the incorporation of the entities, and the actions of their respective officers was assessed.","The National Hotel Company, as a dominant company, would only be liable for the subsidiary’s negligence if it had actual control over the Hotel Longview operations. Here, it was not established that the National Hotel Company exceeded its charter powers or engaged in the hotel business directly. The evidence did not sufficiently demonstrate that the National Hotel Company owned or managed Hotel Longview in a way that would make it liable for the hotel's operational negligence.

For liability to attach to the National Hotel Company under the presented facts, it would need to be proven that the organization was not just a holding company but actively engaged in hotel operations beyond its scope as permitted by its charter. Since there was insufficient proof of such engagement, it was argued that the National Hotel Company should not be held accountable for any alleged failure of the hotel staff to act properly during the fire, and the relationship between the two companies was not one where the parent was using the subsidiary to conduct its business.

The jury’s findings on the negligence of the Texas Hotel Company of Longview are deemed problematic. The evidence surrounding the fire and the company's alleged failure to call the fire department promptly was conflicting. Plaintiff’s testimony, suggesting a delay in calling the fire department, was contradicted by evidence showing that the fire department was called in a timely manner. Moreover, even if there was a delay, there was no conclusive proof that calling the fire department earlier would have prevented the plaintiff's injuries.

The court is likely to determine that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is inapplicable because a fire of unknown origin dwelling within a hotel does not automatically imply negligence by the hotel management. The relationship between the fire starting in the porter’s closet and the resultant injuries was not clearly one of causation directly attributable to hotel management negligence.

Given these issues, the court will reverse the judgment for the guest and rule in favor of the defendants, specifically ruling that the National Hotel Company is not liable for the negligence attributed to the Texas Hotel Company of Longview, and that the negligence charges against the hotel in the fire incident were not substantiated by the evidence presented. The court will instruct a verdict in favor of the National Hotel Company due to the absence of evidence that supports the assertion that they had direct involvement in the hotel operations that could result in liability. As for the Texas Hotel Company of Longview, the court will find that there was no conclusive evidence that negligence on the part of the hotel was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries.

Overall, the court will emphasize the importance of clear evidence linking the specific actions of a defendant to the injuries sustained by a plaintiff and will resist inferences of negligence without a direct causal connection. The court will caution against association of corporate entities' relationships as grounds for negligence without definitive proof of operational involvement, particularly when dealing with a holding company structure."
"Danny Sprabary (Appellant), sued Goodman Networks, Inc. (Appellee) for the wrongful death of his son, alleging that Goodman was aware of his son's diabetes, and had a plan in place to contact the son's girlfriend or brother if he began to suffer from hypoglycemia or other health-related issues while working. The Appellant argued that the company failed to execute this plan on the day of his son's death. According to the Appellant, the son was scheduled to meet with a trainee at a Wal-Mart before going on a service call. The son experienced distress, which was communicated to his supervisor; however, the supervisor failed to contact the designated individuals and instructed the trainee to return the son to the Wal-Mart parking lot, where he later died.

Goodman filed a summary judgment motion, asserting there was no evidence that it owed a duty to the son, that it breached this duty, or that any such breach caused the son's death. They argued that heart disease, not diabetes or any omission on their part, was the proximate cause of death, and included deposition testimony from the medical examiner to support this claim. In response, the Appellant presented an affidavit from Dr. Marvin Pietruszka, which asserted that the son's death was proximately caused by complications related to diabetes mellitus based on autopsy findings.

The trial court struck Dr. Pietruszka's affidavit, deeming it to be conclusory and speculative without any factual explanation of how findings from the autopsy report supported a diabetes-related cause of death over heart disease. The trial court granted summary judgment for Goodman, and the Appellant appealed this decision.","The Appellate Court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The Appellate Court will likely hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking the affidavit of the Appellant's expert witness, Dr. Pietruszka. The Appellate Court will reason that the expert witness's opinion was speculative and conclusory, for he failed to provide a factual explanation or discussion to substantiate the claim that the son's death was caused by diabetes-related complications, as opposed to sudden adult death due to heart disease. Additionally, the Appellate Court will find that the expert witness did not effectively eliminate other possible causes of death, such as heart disease, or provide a basis for concluding that complications related to the son's diabetes mellitus were the proximate cause of death.

The Appellate Court will hold that, with the exclusion of Dr. Pietruszka's affidavit, the Appellant failed to provide more than a scintilla of evidence to show that Goodman's alleged breach of duty and the theory that the son's death was related to his diabetes rather than heart disease. As a result, the Appellant will not have met his burden to overcome the no-evidence summary judgment motion filed by Goodman. The Appellate Court will conclude that the Appellant did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged negligence of Goodman and its causal connection to the son's death. Thus, the Appellant's issues will be overruled, and the trial court's judgment in favor of Goodman will be affirmed."
"Defendant employer Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation was taken to court by 18 plaintiff employees and surviving spouses who claimed damages for personal injuries, wrongful death, and loss of consortium due to long-term exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured at Owens-Corning's plant. These individuals had alleged injuries from the exposure to asbestos during their employment with Owens-Corning.

The case was consolidated from over ninety-six asbestos personal injury cases to eighteen by the time of the trial. Of the 18, twelve employees had alleged ""bystander exposure"" to Kaylo, an Owens-Corning product, while six spouses claimed loss of consortium due to their partners' illnesses. Two workers had died by the time of the trial: one from asbestos-related lung cancer and another from a condition unrelated to asbestos. Notably, settlements for the wrongful death claims were reached early in the proceedings.

Owens-Corning contested the consolidation of cases, arguing it would lead to jury confusion and prejudice, thus denying a fair trial, and specifically objected to including the lung cancer death case with noncancer cases. The trial court overruled these objections. The trial lasted over two weeks, with three plaintiffs settling after testimony began. The trial court instructed the jury to disregard testimonies specific to settled cases.

Legal debates included whether Texas procedural law allowing a 10-2 split jury verdict was valid when Alabama substantive law required unanimity and whether the trial court had used incorrect elements of Alabama liability law in jury instructions on common-law negligence. Owens-Corning also contended that the jury's verdict showed actual prejudice due to the consolidation, arguing the jury ""pigeon-holed"" claimants into four categories of damages arbitrarily.","The court affirmed the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff employees and surviving spouses. The trial court was deemed to have acted correctly in consolidating the remaining 18 causes of action because the similarities in each case’s common issues of law and fact outweighed the dissimilarities. Despite variations in plaintiffs' ages, diseases, occupations, types of asbestos exposure, and medical histories, the cases shared a substantial relationship due to exposure to the same product (Kaylo), with most claiming bystander exposure, and the cases being governed by Alabama law.

The court further held that the defendant failed to demonstrate actual prejudice from the consolidation. Specific inconsistencies within the damage awards demonstrated the jury had considered each claimant's actual damages, rather than being confused or arbitrary. Moreover, the inclusion of the lung cancer wrongful death case was not found to have prejudiced the jury given that case's settlement early in the trial, and the jury was expected to follow the court's instruction not to consider testimony specifically related to settled cases.

Additionally, the court rejected the argument that Alabama’s unanimous verdict rule should apply, upholding the Texas law allowing for a non-unanimous (10-2) verdict in this particular case as this was considered a procedural rule, which falls under the jurisdiction of the forum's laws rather than the governing substantive law.

Regarding the jury's instructions, the court found while there was an error in including elements of Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine (AEMLD) in the negligence instruction, this was a harmless error as the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs on the AEMLD, which was an independent and sufficient ground for recovery.

In conclusion, the appellate court supported the idea that consolidation had been appropriate, any errors on the negligence instruction did not affect the outcome materially, and the application of the split jury verdict was procedural and thus correctly followed Texas law."
"The case involves an appeal from the appellant employer, Heard & Heard, Inc., against a judgment in favor of the appellee car passenger, Louise Kuhnert, for a personal injury action subsequent to a vehicular collision. The collision occurred at night in Bee County, Texas, and involved a truck and trailer owned by the employer, driven by its employee, Charlie Bishop, who was acting within the scope of his employment; and a Chevrolet coupe operated by George Thomasson, with Tom Campbell and Miss Kuhnert riding as passengers. The incident resulted in fatalities (Thomasson and Campbell) and serious injuries to Miss Kuhnert.

Evidence for the case showed that at the time of the collision, the truck driver was partially on the wrong side of the highway, and the jury found this to constitute negligence and a proximate cause of the appellee's injuries. The appellant employer contested the verdict, claiming that the car's driver may have been the sole proximate cause of the collision and the related injuries, which the trial court refused to submit to the jury. The appellant also requested the submission of an ""unavoidable accident"" issue, which was similarly denied.

The case revolved around whether venue could be maintained in Bee County based on the allegations of trespass and crime, with Heard & Heard, Inc. having filed a statutory plea of privilege to contest venue, relying on exceptions in the Texas Civil Statutes; specifically, those concerning crimes, offenses, or trespasses and the ability to bring suits against corporations where the cause of action arose.

The central legal question hinged on the concept of ""proximate cause"" as an element of a venue fact, the court's responsibility to submit issues raised by the evidence to the jury, and whether the trial court correctly refused to submit the issue of ""sole proximate cause"" given the contentions by the employer.","In determining the verdict, the reasoning should most likely focus on legal and evidentiary analysis within the context of venue and proximate cause. Assuming the detailed facts in the background, the Supreme Court will probably acknowledge that proximate cause, as an element of venue fact under the exceptions in Article 1995 used to establish venue over the appellant's plea of privilege, must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. If the evidence sufficiently indicated that an act by Thomasson, the driver of the car, could have been the sole proximate cause of the collision, the trial court should have submitted this issue to the jury. The trial court's refusal to do so could lead to a conclusion that it erred in this aspect, especially if there were evidence supporting this theory.

The verdict in this instance will likely reason that the right to challenge the element of proximate cause is integral to the appellant's defense, and its exclusion may have compromised the integrity of the judicial process by not allowing the jury to consider all theories substantiated by evidence. The verdict would potentially reverse the trial court's judgment based on the reasoning that all elements of a venue fact, such as the relationship between the alleged negligent act (proximate cause) and the injury, should be subject to jury consideration, and the appellant should have the opportunity to present its theory and disputations.

Additionally, since ""proximate cause"" is equally essential in this case for determining both venue and liability, resolving this element in a way that adheres to the standard rules (i.e., placing the burden of proof on the plaintiff and allowing the defendant to contradict plaintiff's evidence) would lead to the contention that core procedural fairness was breached by the trial court's rejection of relevant issue submissions by the appellant. Therefore, the verdict would reverse the judgment and remand the case to address these matters appropriately in line with legal standards. 

This means the original ruling in favor of the passenger, Kuhnert, will likely be set aside, and the case will be sent back to a lower court for a new trial, where the contested issues regarding proximate cause and resultant liabilities should be appropriately submitted to and deliberated by a jury. The court may also possibly provide guidance regarding the necessity for correct pleadings and issue submissions based on venue-related elements for civil actions in the context of personal injury and vehicle accidents."
"The case involves appellant Texas Employers Insurance Association, the workmen's compensation insurer of the employer, Fant Milling Company, and appellee Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, the surviving widow of the deceased employee, A. H. Shifflette. Mr. Shifflette suffered from a heart condition known as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle which is generally incurable but manageable with care against violent exercise, proper diet, and medical treatment. On the day before his death, he was compelled to climb the stairs to the fourth floor of his workplace because the passenger elevator was out of order and he was expressly forbidden to use the freight elevator. Later that day, Mr. Shifflette appeared ill to his wife and claimed he had fallen on the stairs. He passed away during the night. Mrs. Shifflette contended that the exertion of climbing the stairs placed undue strain on her husband's weakened heart, causing a rupture leading to his death. The insurer countered that Mr. Shifflette's demise was a natural result of his existing disease and not work-related.

The trial court ruled in favor of the widow, affirming the jury’s conclusion that Mr. Shifflette had suffered a work-related injury that contributed to his death. The evidence supported that the exertion of climbing the stairs was compelled by his employment and resulted in heart damage leading to his death. The employee's comments to his wife regarding his condition were deemed admissible as spontaneous utterances. The insurer appealed the judgment, raising two main points for consideration: (1) evidence insufficiency to prove that Mr. Shifflette died as a result of an injury received during the scope of his employment; and (2) the alleged hearsay nature of the deceased's statements to his wife should have precluded their admission in court.","The court is expected to acknowledge that the jury's finding that Mr. Shifflette suffered a work-related accidental injury contributing to his death is supported by substantial evidence. The evidence will likely be seen as demonstrating that, due to the malfunctions of the passenger elevator, Mr. Shifflette was obligated to climb multiple flights of stairs, subsequently straining his diseased heart muscle. Medical expert testimony will support the chain of events leading from myocarditis through exertion, rupture, hemorrhage, additional strain, and subsequent ruptures to eventual death.

It is likely that the court will consider Mr. Shifflette's declaration to his wife as part of the res gestae, meaning that the spontaneous statement arose so closely in time and causation to the strenuous activity that it is not overly prejudiced by reflection or fabrication. The comments will likely be considered spontaneous utterances induced by the event (exertion and fall), solicited in an inquisitive interaction from Mrs. Shifflette to explain his visibly poor condition. The court will probably evaluate that the circumstances, including the physical strain, pain, and nearness to the event, validate the trial court's admission of the statement as part of the res gestae exception to hearsay.

The court is expected to affirm the findings of the trial court and jury that the injury sustained by Mr. Shifflette in the course of his employment materially contributed to his death. They may also uphold that the deceased’s death was not solely due to his existing heart disease. As a result, the court will likely affirm the award of the statutory lump sum to the widow, Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, having determined that the legal basis for the judgment aligns with the evidence presented and the applicable law. The insurer's request for a peremptory instruction will be interpreted as appropriately denied, and the court will not find an abuse of discretion in the trial court's admission of Mr. Shifflette's statement to his wife as evidence.

In conclusion, the court will likely affirm the decision in favor of the appellee Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, resulting in the continued provision of compensation due to the work-related injury that contributed to Mr. Shifflette's death."
"The case involves an appeal by parents (appellants) of the deceased, Joseph E. Bowman, who was killed after coming into contact with a live electric wire belonging to the appellee, an electric utility company. The wire had fallen during a severe and unusual lightning storm. The appellants argued that the company was negligent in various aspects: permitting the wire to fall, failing to maintain a system to indicate a downed wire, failing to discover and rectify the downed wire situation, not shutting off the electricity, and employing incompetent personnel at the power plant.
The appellee countered that the wire fell due to lightning and that the deceased was contributorily negligent for touching the wire despite being aware of the danger and having been warned. A jury trial initially found in favor of the utility company. The appellants contended on appeal that errors were made relating to the jury instructions.
Joseph E. Bowman was a 19-year-old blacksmith with a monthly income of about $75. On the day of the incident, he had sought shelter at John Holloway's house during the storm. Holloway warned him about the downed wire that was burning the grass. Despite this, and after Holloway left to notify the electric plant, Bowman touched the wire and was instantly killed.
The evidence presented showed that the appellee had an appliance to indicate a fallen wire, and it was up to the jury to decide whether the company exercised due diligence in the incident and whether their actions or lack thereof were negligent. The appellants argued that the utility company failed to keep a suitable ground detector or comparable appliance to identify and announce a grounded wire or fallen wire at the power plant.","In the reasoning for the verdict, if maintained, it will likely be concluded that the trial court's general charge to the jury was sufficient to cover the alleged negligence by the utility company concerning the fallen wire. The merit of the charge would be that it asked the jury to consider if the appellee, despite knowing of the wire's fallen state and the dangers it posed, failed to act with ordinary care in a timely manner to mitigate the danger, which would constitute negligence if it led to Bowman's death.
However, the key argument underpinning the verdict in favor of the appellee would be the contributory negligence of the deceased. Under this reasoning, the facts established that the deceased was aware of the live wire's danger yet still chose to come into contact with it. This action would be interpreted as a clear display of contributory negligence, which inherently negates a crucial requirement for the appellants to succeed in their negligence claim.
Given the circumstances, if any errors occurred in the jury instructions, they would be considered harmless because the established contributory negligence of the deceased rendered any debate over the appellee's potential negligence moot. Thus, any such errors would not have changed the outcome, and the verdict rendered would be seen as the only appropriate verdict under the law. Therefore, the prediction would be that the appellate court would affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the utility company, concluding that the appellants had not met their burden of proving the appellee’s negligence was the sole cause of Bowman's death and had failed to overturn the contributory negligence finding."
"On April 22, 1983, Tom Beeson underwent cardiac bypass surgery and received seven units of blood by transfusion. In late May 1987, symptoms indicative of potential HIV infection arose and, by June 1987, both Tom and his wife Esther were diagnosed as HIV positive. Tom died on July 2, 1987. The Beesons filed a wrongful death and personal injury suit against the J.K. and Susie L. Wadley Research Institute and Blood Bank (Wadley), alleging that Tom contracted AIDS through a contaminated blood transfusion received during his surgery, and that Wadley had been negligent in screening blood donors and testing blood donations for infection.

The parties stipulated that the blood Tom received was donated by a sexually active homosexual male with multiple sex partners, identified as John Doe. Wadley argued that the Beesons' claims were barred by the statute of limitations given that Tom's injury occurred at the latest by April 22, 1983, hence the claim should have been filed by 1985. Conversely, the Beesons claimed that their cause of action only accrued when Tom exhibited symptoms in May 1987, due to the nature of the injury being inherently undiscoverable and that they had filed the lawsuit within two years of this date, thus within the statute of limitations period.

The court had to consider the applicability of the discovery rule, which tolls the statute of limitations until an injury is discovered or could have been discovered through reasonable diligence. They also evaluated whether Wadley's screening procedures were effective and whether Wadley's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the harm to the Beesons.","The court will affirm the judgment for the Beeson family members based on several findings. The Beesons will have successfully argued that they filed their lawsuit within the statute of limitations period given that they only discovered Tom's infection in 1987, which aligns with the discovery rule that tolls the statute of limitations until the injury is discovered or reasonably could have been discovered. The court will find that their claim of wrongful death and personal injury was filed within this period and that they had correctly pleaded sufficient facts regarding the discovery of the injury.

In terms of the Beesons' entitlement to bring the action, the court will dismiss Wadley's claim that the Beesons' causes of action are time-barred. The verdict will hinge on the legal principle that Tom would have been entitled to bring suit had he discovered his injury within the limitations period. Since the Beesons' claim relates back to the original filing, which is within the statutory limit, Esther's personal injury claim arising from the same set of facts will also not be barred by the statute of limitations.

Regarding causation, Wadley will fail to establish that there was a lack of evidence to show causation and foreseeability. The court will conclude that the jury reasonably could have determined that Wadley's negligent conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to the Beesons. The evidence will suggest that Wadley's screening and donor education procedures were inadequate at the time of the blood transfusion in 1983 and could have led to the transmission of HIV from Doe's donated blood to Tom.

As such, the court will determine that Wadley's argument against foreseeability is without merit and will uphold the jury's finding that Wadley should have anticipated the danger of transmitting HIV through blood transfusions based on the knowledge available at the time. Consequently, the court will affirm the trial court's decision in favor of the Beesons, thus holding Wadley liable for its negligence in causing the wrongful death of Tom Beeson and the personal injury of Esther Beeson."
"Jodi Marie Mason, who suffered from depression, voluntarily entered the Minirth-Meier Unit of Cedars Hospital on July 26, 1993. Her scheduled discharge was set for August 20, 1993. Mason was initially placed on suicide watch and close observation. Dr. Teofilo Moses Ramos, a staff psychiatrist, examined her and concluded that suicide precautions could be discontinued. During her stay, Mason's roommate was Cynthia Thomas, whom she described as manipulative and controlling. Despite this, Mason and Thomas became friends. 

On August 16, 1993, Thomas requested and obtained an unsupervised early discharge from Nurse Sandra Duryea Marx following an order from Thomas's physician, Dr. Paul Meier. Marx informed Thomas's physician about the discharge request but did not take any action regarding Thomas's request that Mason be discharged as well. Subsequently, Mason independently requested an early discharge and expressed her intent to spend time with Thomas after leaving. Marx assessed Mason's condition, notified Ramos by phone, and discharged Mason per Ramos's order. 

Twenty-eight hours post-discharge, Mason was involved in a car accident with Thomas (who was also discharged) and another patient, Richard Cleveland. Thomas, driving at a high rate of speed, swerved to avoid a dog, resulting in a crash that killed Cleveland and paralyzed Mason. Thomas was also injured. Mason did not sue Thomas but brought a lawsuit against Ramos, Marx, Meier, Cedars Hospital, and the Minirth-Meier Clinic on various negligence grounds including improper discharge, failure to provide adequate care, and failure to warn Mason of the danger posed by Thomas. The trial court granted summary judgment against Mason on the grounds that defendants' negligence was not the proximate cause of Mason's injuries, which the court of appeals in part reversed.","Upon reviewing the case, the court will likely find that the defendants’— the physician, the nurse, and the mental health care facility—alleged negligence is too remote from Mason's post-discharge injuries to be considered the proximate cause as a matter of law. The court will assert that while the facility and medical professionals had a duty of care, they were not obligated to insure Mason's well-being after being discharged from their care.

The court will discuss the concept of proximate cause, considering that the negligence must be a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's injury, and not merely a condition which makes the injury possible. The court will explain that the defendants' actions potentially contributed to the circumstance of Mason being in the car with Thomas at the time of the accident but were not ""active and efficient"" causes of the crash itself. The court will draw parallels with similar case precedents, emphasizing that the mere occurrence of a negligent act which eventually leads to an injury does not sufficiently establish a direct and substantial cause-and-effect relationship required for proximate cause.

Expert testimony provided by Mason asserting proximate cause will likely be deemed insufficient to create a fact issue on causation, as it fails to establish a concrete link between the alleged negligence and the actual accident. The court will point out that speculation that Ramos's discharge caused Mason to be injured in Thomas's car wreck is attenuated and would incorrectly make the defendants insurers of Mason's safety in any situation post-discharge.

Predicting the court's reasoning based on Texas law and precedents, it is expected that they will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals regarding the physician, the nurse, and the mental health care facility, rendering a verdict in favor of the defendants, resulting in Mason taking nothing from the suit filed against these parties."
"Sheri Hill (Appellant) filed a premises liability lawsuit against Fitness International, LLC d/b/a L.A. Fitness (Appellee) for negligence and gross negligence after a slip-and-fall incident. The incident occurred when Hill slipped on water in the ladies' locker room of an L.A. Fitness facility in 2019, causing injury. This suit was filed despite Hill having previously signed a membership application with L.A. Fitness eight years earlier, in which she acknowledged a full and complete release of claims, including those for injury incurred in the facility, with language ostensibly releasing L.A. Fitness from liability even if injuries were caused by its negligence.

In response to Hill's filing, L.A. Fitness sought a traditional summary judgment based on the affirmative defense of release due to the contract signed by Hill and supported by her admitted signing thereof. L.A. Fitness also filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion contesting four elements of premises liability. Hill responded by attaching her deposition transcript, as well as deposition transcripts from a former L.A. Fitness water aerobics instructor and a former member-service and operations manager. L.A. Fitness objected to the admissibility of the former employees' deposition transcripts, and the trial court sustained these objections and granted L.A. Fitness's summary judgment motion.

Further analysis of the summary judgment evidence, however, demonstrated that Hill had provided sufficient testimony to raise a factual dispute regarding the existence of several premises liability elements, including that L.A. Fitness had knowledge that water pooled in the locker room at a specific time of day due to scheduling of an aqua class, and that the lack of mats or a wet floor sign created an unreasonable risk of harm.","Given that Hill signed a release that waived her premises liability claim, the trial court rightly granted summary judgment on this aspect. However, her summary judgment evidence was sufficient to raise a factual issue on all no-evidence grounds presented by L.A. Fitness, and L.A. Fitness didn't move for summary judgment on the remaining elements of Hill's gross negligence claim, nor did it amend its summary judgment motion to address those elements.

The appellate court, based on precedent, would likely join other courts in holding Hill's gross negligence claim could survive a negligence claim's release, emphasizing that a pre-injury waiver of future liability for gross negligence is generally considered void against public policy. The court will likely conclude that Hill's evidence is more than a scintilla and raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding L.A. Fitness's no-evidence grounds. The court would predict that the evidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to draw differing conclusions on the actual or constructive knowledge of hazardous conditions, the existence of an unreasonable risk of harm, the failure of L.A. Fitness to take reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk, and the proximate cause of Hill's injuries.

As such, the verdict will likely encompass a detailed rationale explaining why Hill's gross negligence claim has not been negated by the signed release, despite the premises liability claim being barred, and why the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment on the gross negligence claim. The appellate court would thus reverse the trial court's judgment for the gross negligence claim and remand for further proceedings on this claim."
"**  
The case revolves around a medical malpractice claim involving the death of Harold Guerra, following a cervical fusion surgery performed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr. John Halcomb on January 27, 2003. Post-surgery, Guerra was under the care of Nurse Melinda Quinonez LVN. Guerra's wife, Miguela ""Mickie,"" reported to the nursing staff that her husband felt anxious and was having breathing difficulties around 2:30 p.m., shortly after being moved to his hospital room. Contrasting testimonies emerged about the timing of the complaints, with Nurse Quinonez testifying that shortness of breath was not reported by Guerra or his family until 3:25 p.m. The patient continued to experience difficulties, and at 3:45 p.m., a respiratory code was called. Despite attempts by medical staff to intubate Guerra and an emergency tracheostomy performed around 4:05 p.m., he was deprived of oxygen for too long and succumbed to brain death, passing away eleven days later. A jury awarded the plaintiffs, Guerra's survivors, approximately $2.2 million, but the trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of the defendants, the hospital and nurse employees, based on the claimed insufficiency of evidence to support the jury's verdict regarding causation. The plaintiffs appealed this decision.

The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rested on expert testimony, particularly from Dr. David J. Cullen, who asserted that Guerra would not have died if Dr. Halcomb had been notified of the patient's complications at 2:30 p.m., or even as late as 2:45 p.m. Other medical experts and nurses involved corroborated the view that an earlier notification could have led to lifesaving interventions. The defendants argued that insufficient evidence was presented to establish a causal link between the hospital's actions and Guerra's death, emphasizing that none of the medical staff were able to explain why intubation attempts failed. They compared the case to Jea v. Cho, where the court rejected a series of ""ifs"" as evidence.

**","**  
The reviewing court will reverse the JNOV granted by the trial court and remand the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. The reasoning will be based on the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding causation, which allows a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that the hospital's negligence proximately caused Guerra's death. The court will credit Dr. Cullen's expert testimony that establishes a reasonable medical probability that an earlier call to Dr. Halcomb would have provided enough time for a successful intervention, and the hospital's failure to make the call was a substantial factor in bringing about the fatal outcome. The court will consider that the jury is entitled to believe Mickie's report over Nurse Quinonez's conflicting account and that jurors may choose to believe one witness over another. Furthermore, the hospital's foreseeability argument will be addressed, with Nurse Quinonez's testimony inferring that Guerra's death was a foreseeable consequence of not addressing his breathing difficulties sooner. The court will distinguish the present case from Jea v. Cho, noting that in the Guerra case, there was expert testimony specifically articulating a reasonable probability of causation. The hospital's analogy to Cho will fail as the court will not accept the argument that expert opinions regarding causation merely constitute a series of speculative ""ifs."" Instead, the court will find Dr. Cullen's testimony sufficient to support the jury's finding. This detailed analysis of the testimonies and evidence in favor of causation will lead to the conclusion that the evidence meets the standard required for legal sufficiency, necessitating the reversal of the JNOV and upholding the initial jury award."
"The lawsuit was brought by William Maxwell and other adult children of the late Nancy Tasker against a railroad company, following an accident where a pipe connected to a heater on a train operated by the appellant railroad company exploded. The explosion caused significant damage to the train car and very much frightened Nancy Tasker, who was a passenger on the train. Although she did not sustain any external injuries, she experienced pain and vomited blood later that day. Over the subsequent months, she was treated for pneumonia and ultimately died of tuberculosis in November, eight months after the accident.

The central question was whether the train accident was the proximate cause of Nancy Tasker's death. The appellees argued that the traumatic event and subsequent ""nervous prostration"" weakened her condition to a degree that she became susceptible to tuberculosis. Before the incident, Tasker was in good health. The railroad company's defense was hinged on the argument that there was a lack of evidence showing the injuries sustained in the accident caused or even could cause tuberculosis, and they requested multiple instructions to be given to the jury, further contending issues with the amount of damages and double recovery.

Counsel for the appellant railroad company cited various authorities in support of their contention that the facts essential to the plaintiffs' cause of action were not proven, particularly that Nancy Tasker's death was not a result of the train accident. The appellant argued that the requested instructions should have been given – such as one regarding the concurrence of tuberculosis and injuries received from the accident leading to death, and another concerning assessments of damages made by the jury.","The court will affirm the judgment entered in favor of the children in their negligence action against the railroad company. It is likely to be reasoned that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to determine whether Nancy Tasker received injuries from the train accident and that those injuries did not cause her death but possibly made her susceptible to the tuberculosis that did.

The court will likely address the appellant's assignments of error, concluding that the trial court rightly refused the peremptory instruction requested by the defendant because the evidence warranted that the central issues be decided by the jury. As for the issue of the proximate cause, it appears that while the evidence supported the finding that injuries occurred due to the accident, it did not conclusively prove that those injuries caused the tuberculosis that led to Nancy Tasker's death.

Further, the court will likely maintain that the damages awarded to the plaintiffs were not for the loss due to death but for injuries sustained while Nancy Tasker was alive and grounded on the argument that the claims survive to the heirs, citing Article 3353a of the Revised Statutes.

It is to be anticipated that the appellant’s arguments regarding double recovery in the damages and the misdirection in jury charges will be dismissed on the account that the trial court properly instructed the jury and that any alleged errors were non-material to the outcome since the facts stated in testimony were uncontradicted and supported by evidence presented in court.

The court will uphold the jury's role as the arbiter of evidence and witness credibility and reject the argument that the verdict was against the preponderance of the evidence, noting that the jury's verdict seemed to be supported by the evidence and was not influenced by prejudice or misunderstanding. Consequently, the verdict against the railroad company will stand, with the reasoning heavily relying on the jury's right to make determinations on the evidence presented."
"The appellant in this case is a physician, Dr. James C. Pettit, who was seeking review of a judgment from the 170th District Court, McLennan County, Texas, which awarded damages in a medical malpractice case. The appellees are the parents of a deceased patient, Carolyn and Jimmy Dowell, who brought claims under the Texas Wrongful Death Act, the Survival Statute, and the federal anti-dumping statute following the suicide of their son, Lance Dowell.

Lance Dowell, a 21-year-old man, was taken to Providence Health Center in Waco, Texas, by sheriff’s deputies after he had inflicted wounds on himself and expressed suicidal thoughts. At the emergency room, Dr. Pettit requested a psychological assessment and, along with a psychological evaluator, concluded that Lance was not actively suicidal. He was subsequently discharged and spent time with family and friends before hanging himself the following evening.

A jury found the defendants, including Dr. Pettit, negligent, attributing 20% of the negligence to Dr. Pettit and 80% split equally between Providence and DePaul. The jury awarded damage totaling $700,000, which included compensation for past and future mental anguish and loss of society for the parents, as well as pain, mental anguish, and funeral expenses for Lance. Dr. Pettit appealed, contesting the sufficiency of evidence for the breach of the standard of care, the awards for damages, the standing of the parents to recover damages, the inclusion of Lance's son as a beneficiary, the causation, and the proportionality of survival damages, among other things.","When predicting the outcome, it is expected that the appellate court will affirm the judgment of the lower court. The court will likely find that expert testimony provided by Dr. Thomas Donica, a teacher and practitioner of psychiatry, is reliable and establishes a connection between Dr. Pettit's actions and Lance's suicide. Despite Dr. Pettit's objections, expert testimony that is well-grounded in scientific methods and procedures is considered evidence.

The court will reject Dr. Pettit's view that the evidence of pain and mental anguish awarded under the Survival Statute is unsupported. The presence of a death certificate indicating asphyxia by hanging contributes to proving Lance experienced pain and mental anguish before his death.

Challenges to the standing of Lance's parents to recover survival damages are foreseen to be overruled. Carolyn Dowell was appointed as administratrix to act on behalf of Lance's estate, and this appointment is related back to the original petition date; hence, statute of limitations concerns and standing to sue are not problematic here.

Dr. Pettit's concern over the wrongful death action not being prosecuted on behalf of Lance's son, Alec, is anticipated to be dismissed. The wrongful death action was brought timely by the parents, and as Alec did not file a suit within three months or object to the filings, there is no compelling reason to abate the suit on this basis.

The court is not expected to agree with Dr. Pettit's assertion that the evidence of causation is factually insufficient. Given normal jury discretion in weighing evidence and the expert testimony provided, it is likely that the court will find the evidence supports the jury's determination.

Regarding attribution of negligence to Lance for his suicide, the court will probably dismiss the argument based on the Civil Practice and Remedies Code precluding suicide as a defense in situations where failure to meet a standard of care is a partial cause. It would be unnecessary to submit such questions to the jury since Dr. Pettit's liability was separately established.

Finally, the argument that the survival action damages for pain and mental anguish are excessive is expected to be rejected. The court commonly defers to the jury's discretion unless evidence clearly suggests passion or prejudice, which is not believed to be the case herein.

With all issues raised by Dr. Pettit anticipated to be overruled, the original judgment in favor of the parents, Carolyn and Jimmy Dowell, is likely to be affirmed by the appellate court."
"The dairy farmer plaintiff, Mike Odell, operates a 200-head dairy farm near Como, Texas, and began dairy operations in 1974. Initially, Odell mixed his own feed but switched to using a feed mix produced by defendant Purina Mills (Purina), which was sold by defendant Franklin County Feed & Supply (Franklin County) in December 1994. In an effort to increase milk production, Odell was influenced by friends to use Purina feed. The first delivery of this feed took place on December 19, 1994. Odell's feed system included a precautionary magnet to remove metal from his mixed feed, a system he continued to use after switching to Purina's products.

Shortly after introducing the Purina feed, Odell noticed declining milk production and illness in his cows. Despite various adjustments and consultations with representatives from Tri-County, which delivered the feed, and from Purina, including a manager from Purina's Fort Worth manufacturing facility and nutrition experts, Odell found metal-contaminated pellets adhering to the magnets in his feed system. Metal contaminants included metal shavings, rust, wire pieces, and staples. Repeated discoveries of metal contamination occurred with successive Purina feed deliveries through May 1995. Odell ceased Purina feed deliveries in June 1995.

Health issues in the herd included cows diagnosed with hardware disease (traumatic reticuloperitonitis) and displaced abomasum (twisted stomach), which are serious ailments afflicting cattle, potentially caused by ingestion of metal.

At trial, expert witnesses, Dr. J.D. Norris and Dr. Brian Heim, veterinarians, testified on behalf of the plaintiff, offering opinions on causation between the contaminated feed and the cows' injuries. Their testimony included acknowledgments of potential alternate sources of metal ingestion and the absence of tests excluding other causes for the cows' injuries. Despite this, the jury awarded approximately $631,000 in damages for lost market value, lost milk production, mental anguish, and attorney’s fees based on the plaintiff's percentage of the damages.","The judgment awarding damages to plaintiff dairy farmer Mike Odell will be reversed due to the trial court’s error in admitting testimony from the plaintiff’s expert veterinary witnesses, Dr. J.D. Norris and Dr. Brian Heim, whose scientific reliability was not adequately established in line with legal standards such as those from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. The conclusion will be drawn specifically because these experts did not test to rule out other potential causes of the diseases, did not sample the entire herd or all the delivered feed, one expert was hired merely for litigation testimony, and there was no demonstration that the experts used a reliable technique for their conclusions. 

Predictably, they will find that without the expert testimony, there is insufficient factual basis to support the jury's determination that the contaminated feed was responsible for injury to the entire herd. Therefore, the requirement is to evaluate the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding causation which, in this case, will fall short due to the absence of comprehensive testing against all possible sources of injury and inadequate sampling of feed and affected cattle. 

Other related issues that are expected to be addressed in the new trial will include the plaintiff's failure to elect remedies among the different theories of recovery presented, as the varying theories offer different remedies. Additionally, since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp. has determined that attorney's fees under the DTPA are to be based on fees reasonably incurred and not a percentage of the recovery, the case will be remanded with directions to correct the calculation of attorney's fees accordingly, if applicable. The new trial should outline the necessity for the plaintiff to substantiate the claim with evidence upholding a reasonable medical or veterinary probability linking the contaminated feed to the herd's injury and a valuation of damages that are not speculative but grounded in evidence."
"Appellant Thurman McKinney filed a wrongful death action against appellee Air Venture Corporation after his wife, Virginia McKinney, died in an air crash on June 8, 1974. Virginia was one of the six passengers killed when a 1973 Piper Aztec, owned by Air Venture, crashed near Cresson, Texas, during a storm while returning to Meacham Field in Fort Worth from a business trip in Lubbock. The aircraft was caught in turbulence created by a wind shear, resulting from severe thunderstorms in the area. It was established that the crash occurred when the aircraft encountered turbulence due to the wind shear.

The jury returned negative findings on the negligence issues, finding that the pilot, John Dittmaier, was not negligent despite flying into intense thunderstorm activity and failing to divert to another airport. Although it found the pilot was acting as an employee of Air Venture and that $147,225.00 would fairly compensate McKinney for his wife’s death, the judgment ruled that McKinney would ""take nothing.""

On appeal, McKinney challenged the jury's verdict, contending that the findings were against the weight of the evidence and that the pilot was negligent. The evidence included expert testimony from six experts, including pilots and meteorologists, mostly establishing that the pilot was negligent for flying into the thunderstorm and failing to divert. Additional facts underscored the pilot received multiple warnings from various flight services outlining severe weather conditions, including the possibility of hail, high winds, and cloud tops up to 59,000 feet. The evidence showed the pilot acknowledged these warnings but continued toward the planned destination.

The jury findings included that the flight was part of a joint enterprise between Air Venture and A.V. Corpening, Jr. (doing business as Corpening Enterprises), the pilot was a borrowed employee of Air Venture on that occasion, and the pilot was then acting as an employee of Air Venture.

Procedurally, at the close of the evidence, McKinney dismissed Corpening Enterprises and the Corpening estate as defendants, abandoning his claim for exemplary damages. He also filed motions arguing against the jury findings and asking for a new trial.","Upon reviewing the extensive evidence and the expert testimonies, it will likely be predicted that the court would reverse the lower court's ruling that McKinney takes nothing in his wrongful death suit. The appeals court would find that the jury's verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, which indicated that the pilot was negligent in choosing to continue flight toward the destination despite warnings of severe weather conditions, including specific advisories about the intense thunderstorm activity and significant meteorological phenomena like wind shear.

The court would likely hold that flying an airplane, especially under such weather conditions, is beyond the realm of ordinary jurors without expert testimony, and this expert testimony established that the pilot did not exercise the proper level of care expected from someone in his position. The testimony from experienced pilots, who concluded the pilot was negligent, was not sufficiently countered with concrete evidence to the contrary that could have justified the pilot’s actions. The court would predict that the evidence showed the pilot made a conscious choice to risk flying towards severe weather, despite adequate warnings and alternate safe options to divert the flight.

Moreover, Air Venture Corporation, as the owner of the plane and the employer of the pilot, would likely be held responsible under respondeat superior for the actions of their employee in this circumstance. With the pilot exercising control over the flight and not abiding by safe navigational decisions, Air Venture would be liable for the consequences of those decisions.

Additionally, the court would likely reject Air Venture's claim of immunity under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act. Based on the specifics of the case, including the relationship between the pilot, Air Venture, and Corpening Enterprises, it would be likely ruled that Air Venture was not an agent of Virginia McKinney's employer for purposes of the Act and thus not immune from the wrongful death action.

The court would express that the verdict was manifestly unjust and against the interests of justice and, consequently, reverse and remand for a new trial where McKinney's claims could be reassessed. The court would also likely conclude that the evidence suggested that if the pilot had adhered to the information and exercised the caution that a reasonable and prudent pilot would under the same weather conditions, the tragic accident could have been avoided."
"John Meier, an 81-year-old patient, arrived at North Central Medical Center's emergency room on January 2, 2001, with abdominal pain, was diagnosed with gallstones, and underwent surgery the next day. Following this initial surgery, Meier required two subsequent surgeries over the next ten days due to a bowel obstruction, leading to a deterioration in his health. He was transferred to the ICU on January 13 with multiple severe medical conditions, including adult respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure, necessitating a ventilator and a ""do not resuscitate"" order.

While in the ICU, Meier developed a skin tear on his tailbone that progressed into a serious decubitus ulcer. His condition improved, and on February 6, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital where he developed further ulcers. Eventually, the ulcer on his tailbone healed by August, but he continued to experience discomfort and was limited in his activities.

Meier filed a lawsuit claiming that North Central was negligent by failing to provide pressure relief, leading to the development of the decubitus ulcer, and failing to properly care for and treat the ulcer afterward. The jury found in favor of Meier, awarding him damages for medical expenses, physical pain, mental anguish, and physical impairment. On appeal, North Central contended the jury verdict was unsupported, and that the trial court wrongfully excluded crucial evidence and expert testimony from Life Care Hospital. Specifically, North Central asserted that Meier developing ulcers at Life Care, despite being turned every two hours, demonstrated that the ulcer was unavoidable, not due to their negligence.

The trial court excluded the Life Care records and testimony on relevance grounds, determining they did not relate directly to the care Meier received under their watch, and held the potential to confuse and mislead the jury. Additionally, the appellate court noted that North Central failed to establish how the conditions at North Central and Life Care were comparable or that the medical records were crucial and non-cumulative.","The appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment. It will determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the medical records and expert testimony from Life Care, which North Central argued were essential to its defense. The court will find that North Central did not meet the burden of demonstrating that the conditions at Life Care and those at North Central were sufficiently similar to warrant the inclusion of the excluded evidence.

Furthermore, the appellate court will address the potential for confusion and misleading the jury as per Texas Rules of Civil Evidence 403. The court will find North Central's arguments insufficient because it did not demonstrate that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its potential for confusion. Additionally, regarding the substantive content of the appeal, the court will determine that North Central did not prove that the disputed evidence was controlling on the issue of proximate cause or that it was not cumulative of other evidence presented during the trial.

The court will also assess the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict. The appellate court will find that there is sufficient legal and factual evidence to support the jury's finding of proximate cause. The testimony from expert witnesses for Meier indicating that the nurses failed to attempt turning him and did not provide adequate wound care once the pressure ulcer developed will be seen as convincing evidence along with nursing documentation from North Central.

Lastly, the court will conclude that the trial court's potential error in excluding evidence was harmless because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to allow the jury to find North Central's negligence was a substantial factor in causing Meier's injuries. Therefore, the appellate court will overrule North Central's challenges to the exclusion of evidence and sufficiency of the evidence, upholding the jury's verdict and the trial court's judgment."
"The petitioner, Jay B. Stroburg, son of John B. Stroburg, Jr., sought to recover on an insurance policy issued by the respondent insurer as the beneficiary after his father was killed in an automobile accident. The policy was intended to insure against bodily injury and death caused by accident. The trial court had found in favor of the petitioner, but the civil court of appeals reversed this decision, concluding that the evidence did not support the jury's finding that the insured's death resulted solely from bodily injuries caused by the automobile accident.

The insurance policy in question excluded loss caused by illness, disease, bodily infirmity, or any bacterial infection that did not occur due to an accidental cut or wound. The respondent insurer held that a bleeding ulcer and emphysema, pre-existing conditions suffered by the insured, contributed to his death and therefore sought to deny the claim based on the policy's exclusion clause. The petitioner had the burden of proving that the death resulted directly and independently from the injuries caused by the accident and was not due to the ulcer or emphysema.

The petitioner secured jury answers affirming that the insured's death was a result of the injuries from the accident and that neither the ulcer nor the emphysema contributed to his death. However, the civil court of appeals rejected these findings, indicating that they were not supported by the evidence, which suggested that the pre-existing conditions contributed to the insured's death alongside the accidental injuries.

At the trial level, there were discussions on the medical evidence regarding the cause of death from various doctors. Dr. Moskovitz's testimony suggested that the injuries from the accident were the overwhelming cause of death, while Dr. DaSilva supported the contribution of emphysema. The jury was instructed to consider whether any pre-existing condition was so insubstantial that it did not legally contribute to the insured's death. Though the death certificate mentioned emphysema and the ulcer as contributing conditions, this was considered prima facie evidence subject to rebuttal.

The supreme court found the evidence did not conclusively establish that disease was a proximate cause of the insured's death. Since the policy's exclusionary clause did not explicitly exclude losses indirectly caused by illness or disease and the proximate cause was the accident itself, the court held that the trial court's judgment was supported by the evidence.","The court is expected to reverse the judgment of the civil court of appeals and remand the case back to them for further consideration, instructing them to decide on points of error that assert the evidence was factually insufficient to support the jury's findings. This instruction is given because those points are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the civil court of appeals and were not previously decided. In making its decision, the court will likely emphasize that the policy exclusion for illness and disease only applies if these conditions were the proximate, rather than an indirect or remote cause of death.

The distinction between proximate causes and contributing conditions will be significant in this decision. The appellate court will likely be directed to consider the legal test of substantiality rather than a strictly medical interpretation. This will involve assessing whether the pre-existing conditions were dominant causes or merely incidental factors in the insured's death. If found that the injuries from the accident remained the direct and predominant cause of death, coverage under the policy would be affirmed, as the policy did not expressly exclude indirect contributions from illness or disease to the insured's loss. Therefore, the judgment will likely conclude that the petitioner son is entitled to recover on the insurance policy."
"Plaintiff Robert Collins, a railroad employee, sued his employer, Pecos & Northern Texas Railway Company, for injuries resulting from negligent poisoning while handling railroad ties treated with creosote. Collins alleged that the railway company failed to warn him about the dangers of creosote, which led to his permanent injuries. In the District Court of Parmer County, the jury found in favor of Collins, supporting his allegations that he was unaware of the dangerous properties of creosote, which was known or should have been known by the railway company. Evidence supported his claim that he sustained permanent injuries as a proximate result of the poisoning and the railway company’s negligence.

The Court of Civil Appeals, however, overturned the decision, stating that there was no evidence proving that the employer’s negligence was the proximate cause of Collins's permanent injuries. The Appeals Court further stated that permanent injuries could not have been reasonably anticipated and thus the railway company could not be charged with negligence without showing anticipation of such injuries. Collins appealed the decision to the higher court, leading to a further review of the judgment.

Arguments presented by the plaintiff focused on the employer's obligation to warn about potential dangers from contact with wet creosote ties. The defense argued that there was no evidence that handling the ties in usual manners would cause systemic poison. Moreover, it argued that it could not be feasibly anticipated that employees handling the ties would develop systemic poisoning as a result of such contact.

The Commission of Appeals, after reviewing the case, opined that when permanent injuries result from negligence, the wrongdoing party is responsible for all consequences that naturally and proximately flow from said negligence. It asserted that anticipation of precise injuries is not a prerequisite for a duty of care; it's enough if some injury could be reasonably foreseen. The Commission of Appeals also held that whether permanent injuries were a natural and proximate result of the employer's negligence was indeed a question of fact for the jury to decide.","The supreme court will adopt the judgment recommended by the Commission of Appeals. The premise of the verdict is rooted primarily in the fact that negligence was established in relation to potential injuries that may have been foreseen by the employer at the time of misconduct. Even though the specific permanent injuries sustained by Collins were not anticipated, they were nonetheless probable and followed naturally from the railway company’s negligence, without intervening independent causes. It will be determined that the permanent injuries suffered by Collins were the natural and proximate results of the company's failure to warn about the dangers of creosote, pursuant to the testimony and evidence presented. Consequently, the railway company will be held responsible for the full extent of Collins's injuries. The court will overturn the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals and reaffirm the original judgment of the trial court, thereby ruling in favor of Collins. The court will also address any other assignments of error presented by the appellant and find that they do not mandate a reversal of the lower court's decision. The specifics of the court's charge and the special charges requested by the defendant, which were previously in contention, are deemed to have been addressed adequately, further supporting the decision to hold the railway company liable for Collins's permanent injuries."
"Patsy Snodgrass underwent a heart bypass surgery on February 20, 2009, at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center. Post-operatively, she was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit, where she received care from nurses and respiratory therapists. However, she did not regain consciousness post-surgery. On February 21, during visitation, it was observed by her family and the nurses that the bed she was in did not maintain the intended elevation of about thirty degrees; instead, it spontaneously and gradually lowered itself. Mrs. Snodgrass was then moved to another bed. A February 23 MRI revealed significant brain damage, and she never regained consciousness, eventually passing away on March 4, 2009.

The plaintiffs filed a health care liability action on June 14, 2010, against Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center and its employees, as well as Hill-Rom Company, Inc., the manufacturer of the bed. They alleged that the spontaneous lowering of the bed's head most likely caused displacement of the oxygen-supplying endotracheal tube, resulting in a loss of oxygen and consequent brain damage. The plaintiffs claimed negligence by Hillcrest's staff in responding to the situation and also held Hill-Rom liable under theories of products liability and negligence.

The plaintiffs had until May 6, 2011, to file their designations of expert witnesses, which they did not meet. Hillcrest and Hill-Rom filed no-evidence motions for summary judgment on June 24 and June 30, 2011, respectively, asserting that the plaintiffs had no evidence of causation, which is a key element in health care liability claims. The trial court granted the motions after a July 26, 2011, hearing and signed a final judgment on August 19. This appeal followed.","In addressing the appeal, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed. In the causation element of a health care liability claim, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of the injury. In this case, the plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that met the legal requirement of establishing causation through qualified expert testimony. The affidavits of nurses Davis and Guercia, provided by plaintiffs, did not qualify as evidence of causation as neither were legally qualified to render an opinion on causation in a health care liability claim. Furthermore, their opinions were deemed speculative and not based on reasonable medical probability, which is necessary for establishing causation. Dr. Webb's letter also failed to provide any evidence regarding causation as he did not opine on the proximate cause of Mrs. Snodgrass's brain injury.

Regarding the discovery period, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering Hillcrest's no-evidence motion despite claims by the plaintiffs that they hadn't had adequate time for discovery. The expert designation deadline had passed without the plaintiffs designating a qualified expert on causation, which was essential for their health care liability claim. Therefore, neither the pending depositions nor the inspection of the bed by the ""bed expert"" would have remedied the absence of causation evidence.

As for the assertion that the court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Hill-Rom since the claim against it was of products liability and not health care liability, this argument by the plaintiffs was inadequately briefed and therefore considered waived. Even if it were properly before the court, the absence of evidence of causation still persists.

Finally, the plaintiffs' proposed application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not stand as it does not relieve the claimant of the need to prove causation, which was not established in this case. Therefore, reliance on this doctrine does not affect the absence of causation evidence.

In conclusion, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed as the plaintiffs have overruled each of their issues on appeal due to the failure to present evidence of causation and properly adhere to discovery schedules and expert designations."
"The parents of the decedent, Pennie Johnson, who was a chronic mental-health patient for nearly ten years, brought a wrongful death action against a medical center, a doctor, a nurse, and a hospital after Pennie committed suicide by stepping into traffic following her release from Parkland Hospital where she sought voluntary admission. 

The medical treatment prior to her suicide involved a Department of Public Safety officer discovering Pennie walking on the Dallas North Tollway, threatening to harm herself. The officer took her to Parkland's emergency room. At the emergency room, a nurse noted Pennie had taken medication seven times that day, which exceeded the prescribed dosage, leading to her medication being confiscated and placed in the nurses' station. Pennie subsequently asked for the return of her medication and became verbally abusive when it was not returned. 

Lisa Kassen, the charge nurse, testified that she, Dr. Kalra, and nurse Knowles jointly decided against returning the medication due to Pennie's suicidal threats. Kassen proposed returning the medication if Pennie agreed to be sent home by a taxi, but Pennie declined. Dr. Kalra, a third-year resident doctor at the medical center, evaluated Pennie and decided to discharge her based on the guidelines of a ""difficult-patient file"" that recommended discharge unless the patient displayed significantly different symptoms than those seen before. Pennie was denied admission and had her confiscated medication withheld, despite her threats of suicide if they were not returned. She left the hospital unescorted and approximately thirty minutes later, she was fatally struck by a truck on Interstate 35. 

The court had to review the summary judgment for the medical center and doctor, and a directed verdict for the nurse and hospital. Appellants challenged the medical providers' actions as negligence contributing to the wrongful death of their daughter, arguing that they failed to provide standard medical care and official immunity was not warranted for these medical providers. The court examined if sovereign immunity should protect these entities given the specific circumstances of the case.","The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the medical center and doctor, and the directed verdict in favor of the nurse and hospital, remanding the case back to the trial court. 

The court reasoned that the expert testimony used to grant summary judgment was insufficient—it did not qualify the deponent as an expert, failed to set out the applicable standard of care, and did not address the cause of damages. Moreover, the court held that Dr. Kalra and Nurse Kassen were not entitled to official immunity, reasoning that treating a patient was not an act involving governmental discretion and did not grant the nurse quasi-judicial status. The court also concluded that claims for negligence against the hospital invoked a limited waiver of sovereign immunity because it pertained to the hospital's failure to provide standard medical care. 

The decision anticipated that the appeals court found the evidence presented against both Dr. Kalra and the medical center, specifically centering on their reliance on the difficult-patient file and the failure to obtain a second opinion from a senior psychiatrist, was material and created a genuine issue of fact regarding the standard of care required and whether there had been a breach of this standard. Similarly, for Nurse Kassen and Parkland Hospital, the court maintained that their handling of the medication and the suicide threat situation led to a failure of providing appropriate care as it was not consistent with standard medical practices for such scenarios, rendering summary judgment and the directed verdict inappropriate. 

The appeals court would have noted the need for full hearings to properly address the alleged negligence and causation of Johnson's death due to the complex nature of mental health treatment and the specifics of the individual's case, leaving these issues to be sorted out back at trial.}"
"The case involves twin premature infants, Hunter and Tyler, born on December 26, 1996, at Harris Methodist Hospital. They both required intensive care due to various conditions, with Hunter at particular risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a condition which could lead to blindness. Dr. Kim Smith, the attending neonatologist, ordered a screening ROP examination for Hunter, which was conducted by Dr. Gross, a consulting pediatric ophthalmologist, who found Stage I ROP in Hunter's right eye. Dr. Gross recommended a follow-up visit within two weeks. This was communicated to Tyler and Hunter's mother, Alyssha, who scheduled appointments with Dr. Gross for both twins following their discharge.

Both infants were given the surname Taylor at the hospital, but the mother used the name Burt when scheduling their appointments. A letter from Dr. Smith's office, on behalf of Dr. Gross (“Dear Parent” letter), had stated that Dr. Gross was the pediatric ophthalmologist on staff in the NICU and would contact the parents if any significant findings regarding their baby’s vision were detected. However, the appointments with Dr. Gross were missed due to a lack of a timely referral and subsequent hospitalization for a virus. The family eventually became dissatisfied with their pediatrician, Dr. Yee, and switched to Dr. Stephanie Perdue. In the interim, the twins' eyesight deteriorated, leading to partial blindness diagnosed in June 1997. The parents filed a lawsuit against the doctors and hospital, alleging negligence in treating and diagnosing the twins for ROP.","The judgment was reversed, with the reasoning centering on the absence of a continuing physician-patient relationship between Dr. Gross, Dr. Perdue, All Saints, and the twins post NICU discharge. The court established that any duty owed by Dr. Gross concluded upon completing the screening and reporting his findings to the twins' primary physician. As for Dr. Perdue, her negligence was argued not to be a proximate cause of the injury due to the advanced stage of ROP growth assumed at the time she first saw the twins. Scheduled missed appointments and the ""Dear Parent"" letter did not establish or prolong the physician-patient relationship or duty by Dr. Gross. For a continued duty to exist, an affirmative action by both the patient and consulting doctor to maintain the relationship would be required. Therefore, without an established physician-patient relationship between Dr. Gross, Dr. Perdue, All Saints, and the twins after the NICU stay, no duty was owed, and thus, no negligence could be connected to the eventual blindness of Hunter and Tyler. The reversal of the judgment implies that the doctors and the medical associates did not hold legal responsibility for the outcome suffered by the twins."
"The driver, Alexis Pichardo Sr., along with his family, challenged a decision from the 17th District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, which had previously granted a take-nothing summary judgment in favor of the defendants – a company, Big Diamond, Inc, and a gas station, Diamond Shamrock Stations, Inc. This legal case emerged following an incident on November 23, 2002, when James C. Luedtke Jr., after getting gasoline at a Diamond Shamrock gas station, drove off without paying. In his attempt to escape, Luedtke ran a red light and collided with a vehicle driven by Alexis Pichardo Sr., resulting in injuries to Pichardo and his son Andrew. The rest of the family following in a separate car – Peggy Pichardo and two minors, Alexis Pichardo Jr. and Richard Anderson, witnessed the collision.

Subsequently, on November 19, 2004, the Pichardos sued Luedtke, the owner of the vehicle he was driving – Selma Ann Roberts, and Big Diamond. In response, Big Diamond filed a general denial claiming it had been misidentified and was not the operator or owner of the gas station, while Diamond Shamrock argued its defense based on statute limitations, the absence of a legal duty owed, unforecastability of Luedtke’s actions, and lack of proximate cause linking its actions to the Pichardos' injuries.

The court explored various aspects of the case including legal duty, the concept of negligence, and the foreseeability of Luedtke's subsequent criminal actions post-theft. Diamond Shamrock posited that it had negated the foreseeability element of the negligence claim by showing Luedtke's act of running the red light as a superseding cause of injury, while Big Diamond stood its ground on having no ownership or control over the gas station in question.","The court will reaffirm the trial court’s summary judgment for Big Diamond and Diamond Shamrock, as presaged. With regards to Big Diamond, the evidence will be deemed clear and undisputed that it did not own, or operate the gas station where the incident took place, therefore negating any possible duty owed to the Pichardos. The testimony from Doug Miller, an officer of Big Diamond, will have confirmed that while it held alcohol licenses for the associated facility, it was Diamond Shamrock that owned, constructed, and operated the gas station.

In the case of Diamond Shamrock, the crime that resulted in the Pichardos' injuries – Luedtke running the red light after stealing gasoline – will be considered unforeseeable and extraordinary rather than a normal outcome resulting from the gas station's operation. Despite Pichardos' claims, the court will find no valid evidence that Diamond Shamrock could have reasonably anticipated that not requiring prepayment for gasoline could lead to a third-party criminal act of such nature and consequence.

Additionally, there will be no record evidence showing past similar accidents, frequent gas thefts, or a high-crime area which could establish a pattern leading to a foreseeable crime. Since the Pichardos failed to provide any controverting evidence indicating foreseeability of the crime, the court will hold that Diamond Shamrock conclusively negated the foreseeability element necessary for proximate cause in a negligence claim. The decision will affirm that Diamond Shamrock’s lack of prepayment policy for gasoline did not result in a legal duty to Alexis Pichardo Sr. and his family regarding the subsequent criminal acts of a third-party off the premises."
"Mrs. O. F. West, as the surviving wife and legally appointed guardian of Howard Floyd and Maurine, the minor children of the deceased O. F. West, along with West's parents, H. T. West and Mattie, sued the Texas Utilities Company for damages due to O. F. West's death, which they alleged was caused by the company's negligence. O. F. West was electrocuted when attempting to put up an uninsulated copper wire from a windmill tower to his dwelling to serve as a radio aerial. The copper wire came into contact with the utility company's high-tension power line that presented the appearance of being insulated; however, the insulation was either insufficient from the start or had deteriorated due to age and exposure to weather. The plaintiffs argued that the company knew or should have known about the dangerous condition of the high-tension lines through ordinary diligence but failed to warn the deceased or remedy the defect, which they claimed was the proximate cause of O. F. West's death.

The trial court sustained the defendant's plea of limitations as to Mrs. O. F. West and the parents but held that this limitation did not apply to the minor children. A jury found that the high-tension wires were not sufficiently insulated, that the company failed to warn the deceased of the danger, and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of O. F. West. As a result, the trial court awarded damages to the children of O. F. West, prompting the utility company to appeal. The company contended that Mrs. West's guardianship established over two years before the lawsuit barred the claim under the statutes of limitation, and argued that the trial court erred by not ruling as a matter of law that the company was free from actionable negligence and that the deceased was contributorily negligent.","The court will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial. The appellate court will hold that while the trial court correctly determined the children's claims were not barred by a limitations period due to their minority status, it was incorrect for the trial court to have effectively ruled as a matter of law that there was no actionable negligence on the part of the utility company, or that O. F. West was guilty of contributory negligence. The appellate court will find that the jury's determination of negligence, duty of care, and foreseeability of injury due to the inadequately insulated power lines must be assessed by the facts presented, which include community customs regarding radio aerial installation, Mr. West's status as a property occupant (rather than a trespasser or licensee), the nature of electricity as a dangerous agency, and the evidence regarding the appearance and actual condition of the insulation. The conflicting jury findings on foreseeability will necessitate a new trial to resolve the inconsistency. The appellate court will also find fault with the main charge given to the jury as it incorrectly assumed the existence of negligence, and some of the issues were duplicative or potentially confusing regarding the burden of proof. The court will emphasize that Texas Utilities Company had a duty to use due care in maintaining its power lines, to remedy known defects, to anticipate and prevent injuries, and that the degree of care required was proportional to the danger posed by the power lines, taking into consideration their location and the likelihood of injury. The appellate court will conclude that these considerations were not properly adjudicated during the initial trial and that further proceedings are necessary to correctly apply the legal principles to the facts of the case."
"The background of the case involves a series of events leading to fatal and non-fatal injuries sustained in a double car accident. The incident began when Appellee Addie Campbell Sharp reentered U.S. Highway No. 67 from Bill Purdy's store in Bowie County, Texas, around 6:00 PM on November 14, 1964. While it was lightly raining, she drove her pickup truck in a westerly direction and was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Appellee Thomas J. Marshall, which was towing a horse trailer. The impact caused the horse trailer to overturn and block the highway.

Appellant Estella Payton's husband William Payton Jr., appellant Jewel Fay Bell (acting as next of friend for her minor children with decedent John Homer Bell), and Frank T. Bransford attempted to remove the overturned trailer and horse from the road when another vehicle, driven by W. W. Fore, struck the trailer, killing William Payton Jr. and John Homer Bell and injuring others, including Frank T. Bransford.

Lawsuits were filed by the survivors and injured parties against W. W. Fore and his wife (Myrtle Fore), Thomas J. Marshall, and Addie Campbell Sharp and her husband, Ed Sharp, seeking damages for wrongful death and personal injuries. During the proceedings, appellants nonsuited the Fores but the case continued including them as parties at the behest of the defendants seeking contribution in the event of a recovery against them.

The cases, which shared common legal and factual questions, were consolidated for a jury trial. The jury found Addie Campbell Sharp negligent in causing the first collision but not in causing the second. They absolved Thomas J. Marshall of negligence in the first collision and found W. W. Fore negligent in causing the second collision through various acts of negligence, adding that his manner of driving was a new, independent and intervening cause of the second collision. They also found that the victims assumed the risk of a known danger by attempting to clear the roadway and that the rescue doctrine (where a rescuer can claim damages for injuries sustained during an attempted rescue) did not apply since the negligence of the parties they were rescuing contributed to their injury or death. Consequently, the trial judge rendered a take nothing judgment in favor of Addie Campbell Sharp and Thomas J. Marshall. 

The appeals presented over 70 points against the judgment. The appellants disputed the jury’s findings, contending among other things that the trial court should have submitted issues of negligence and proximate cause regarding Addie Campbell Sharp's involvement in the second collision and that W. W. Fore's negligence should not have been considered a new, independent, and intervening cause but rather a concurring or cooperating cause.","The court upheld the take nothing judgment for Appellees Addie Campbell Sharp and Thomas J. Marshall on claims by Appellants Estella Payton, Jewel Fay Bell, and Frank T. Bransford. The court concluded that although Addie Campbell Sharp's negligence caused the initial accident, it was not the proximate cause of the subsequent accident that resulted in fatalities and injuries. Instead, W. W. Fore's negligent actions were deemed a new and independent intervening cause of the second collision. The court reasoned that a causal connection must be firmly established and not based on conjecture. It was determined that Sharp’s involvement in the first collision was merely a condition that allowed the second collision to occur, not a contributing factor to it.

The court rejected the idea that Addie Campbell Sharp could be held liable for the subsequent collision because she would have had to foresee an extraordinarily unlikely sequence of events stemming from her initial negligence, including the second collision caused by W. W. Fore's driving. Under the law, foreseeability is a requisite component of proximate cause, and it was judged that the sequence of events leading from the first to the second collision was not foreseeable. The court further elucidated that a prior cause cannot be considered proximate if it only furnishes a condition that makes the injury possible but does not directly lead to the injury, especially when the injury results from an unforeseeable intervening cause.

The jury's findings that Marshall was not negligent and that Fore's driving was the sole proximate cause of the second collision were supported by evidence of sufficient probative force, validating the court's decision. As a result, the court ruled that the judgment was correct and denied precedent to propositions that would have held Addie Campbell Sharp responsible as a concurrent cause for an accident that her actions did not directly provoke or could have reasonably been anticipated to cause."
"The appellant corporation, Burrus Mills, Inc., appealed a decision from the District Court of Hamilton County (Texas) challenging the jurisdictional ruling. The dispute originated with a turkey raising agreement made between appellees (M. M. Phillips and his wife) and defendants J. B. Woodard, D. E. Bullock (both residents of Hamilton County), and Burrus Mills, Inc. (a corporation residing in Dallas County). H. H. Weatherby, an employee and agent of Burrus Mills, had negotiated with the plaintiffs and individual defendants in 1951 regarding this agreement. The agreement, formalized in early 1952, stipulated that the defendants would deliver turkey poults that were free of contagious disease to the plaintiffs for production purposes.

The delivered poults, however, were infected with a deadly and contagious poultry disease known as fowl typhoid. This resulted in the death of 1034 poults and damaged the health of the remaining birds, ultimately reducing their market value, particularly their suitability for sale as breeding stock. The court found the appellees' premises were clean and disease-free prior to the delivery of the diseased poults.

The trial court also recognized that Woodard and Bullock were agents of the corporation, and their business with the appellees was intimately connected such that both could be joined to avoid multiple lawsuits. Burrus Mills, Inc. was found to have maintained a fixed and permanent agency in Hamilton County through Woodard and Bullock, who were conducting business under J. B. Woodard Produce.

The trial court found that the defendants were negligent, as their delivery of diseased poults was a breach of both express and implied warranties of the health of the poults, as well as a proximate cause of the plaintiffs' damages. Additionally, the court found no merit in the claim that the appellees had knowledge of the poults' diseased condition upon delivery.","The appellate court is expected to uphold the judgment of the trial court if there is evidence of a probative nature to support it. As the case was decided without a jury, the appellate court should not replace the trial court's factual findings unless the trial court's findings are unsupported by the record. The appellate court, upon inspecting the evidence carefully, should determine that the trial court's findings are backed by evidence of a probative nature, and thus, they should sustain the judgment of the trial court that overruled the appellant's plea of privilege.

The appellant's points challenging the trial court's findings on warranties, the negligence of the defendants, the alleged knowledge by the appellees of the poults' diseased condition, and the agency relationship between Woodard, Bullock, and Burrus Mills, Inc. are to be overruled. The trial court should be deemed correct in its decision, finding the plaintiffs, M. M. Phillips and his wife, had sufficiently proved a cause of action against both the resident defendants and the appellant.

It would be held that the rule cited in Stockyards National Bank v. Maples, which pertains to intimate connection between causes of action against resident and nonresident defendants to avoid multiplicity of lawsuits, applies to this case. Hence, all complaints from the appellant should be dismissed, and the judgment should stand as delivered by the trial court."
"Michael E. Miller went to Dallas Regional Medical Center with abdominal pain on August 13, 2013. A CT scan indicated a gallbladder problem. The next day, Dr. George M. Hariz performed surgery on Miller, during which he inadvertently created a hole or wound in Miller's duodenum and placed a ""#10 Jackson-Pratt drain"" in the wound. On August 16, notwithstanding drainage of ""greenish"" fluid from the surgical wound, Miller was discharged from the hospital.

Miller was scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Hariz on August 23, but because he was feeling unwell and feverish, he consulted Dr. Hariz on August 21. Dr. Hariz treated Miller and asked him to return on August 23. However, Miller went to the Dallas Regional Medical Center emergency room on August 22 due to vomiting greenish fluid. After receiving unsatisfactory care, he sought treatment at another hospital where he underwent emergency surgery on August 22 and another surgery the following day. He was hospitalized for nearly a month before being discharged.

Miller subsequently sued Dr. Hariz, Lone Star HMA, L.P., and Mesquite HMA General, LLC (the appellees), claiming Dr. Hariz's negligence during surgery, the early discharge decision, and during the August 21 visit. Furthermore, he alleged the appellees' nurse employees were negligent in monitoring, treating, observing, charting, documenting, reporting, and caring for Miller post-operation.

Several months into the case, Miller settled with Dr. Hariz. Appellees later sought to strike Miller's expert witness, Dr. Brian Harkins, and filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion on causation. Miller argued against striking Harkins's testimony and the summary judgment but the trial judge struck the expert testimony and granted summary judgment for appellees. Miller's motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this appeal.

The crucial aspect under contention is whether Miller's causation expert, Dr. Harkins, provided reliable testimony that poor charting of additional information about drainage from Miller's surgical wound was a proximate cause of his injuries. There was an absence of evidence regarding what the unrecorded drainage information would have been, leaving it to speculation whether this missing information would have altered the treating physician's decision to discharge Miller. Dr. Harkins’s testimony was asserted to be conclusory, speculative, and lacking a factual basis from the record.","The court did not err in striking the expert because the key causation testimony from Dr. Harkins was conclusory, unsupported by facts in the record, and speculative. Causation in a medical malpractice case requires proof to a reasonable medical probability that the alleged negligence was a proximate cause of the injury. It includes two components: cause-in-fact, which involves substantial factor and ""but-for"" causation, and foreseeability. Harkins’s causation testimony failed to provide a detailed factual basis explaining how better documentation of drainage volumes would probably have changed Dr. Hariz's decision making. The testimony did not meet the standards for causation because it did not provide evidence that the negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injury or that without the alleged negligent act or omission, the harm would not have occurred.

In summary judgment, the nonmovant must produce evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to each challenged element. Miller failed to present any such evidence regarding causation. The court will affirm the summary judgment due to the fact that Miller did not point to any evidence that could raise a genuine issue of fact regarding causation. Miller's arguments rely on speculative assumptions not supported by the record, such as the notion that more detailed charting would have influenced Hariz's decision or that drainage volumes recorded after the fact would have affected the discharge decision. Without such evidence, the causation claim cannot stand, and thus the grant of summary judgment is proper. The trial court's judgment will be affirmed, as Miller's appeal does not present grounds that would suggest an error in the trial court's decisions."
"The appellant in this case is the employer's compensation insurer, Texas Employers' Insurance Association. The appellees are the widow and heirs of J.W. Burnett, an employee who died from typhoid fever a year after being struck in the head by iron piping while working for Estelle Oil Company. The initial incident occurred on August 26, 1930, leading to a severe head injury for Burnett, and ultimately, total and permanent incapacitation. The death of Burnett from typhoid fever on September 11, 1931, led to a claim for compensation under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act.

The initial claim was prosecuted to the Industrial Accident Board and then followed by a trial in the District Court of Jefferson County, both ruling in favor of the widow and heirs, granting them compensation for Burnett's death. The insurer challenged the Board's and trial court's decisions, contending the death was not proximately caused by the earlier employment-related injury. The court maintained that it was only necessary to demonstrate that the injury was a ""producing cause"" of the death, and upon evaluating the evidence, liability for compensation was affirmed.

However, during the trial, a reversible error occurred with the jury instruction that informed jurors of the effects their answers would have. This legal misstep prompted an appellate review, adding complexity to the case. It was noted that Burnett's lowered resistance—due to the work-related injury—was viewed as a “producing cause” of his subsequent death from typhoid, which is a germ disease not directly caused by his work injury. Expert testimony presented conflicting opinions on whether the injury contributed to Burnett's lowered resistance and susceptibility to typhoid, thereby contributing to his death. The jury affirmatively answered that the injury was a producing cause of Burnett's death, which was the basis for the initial compensation award.","The appellate court will reverse the judgment of the trial court based on the reversible error made during the jury instructions. While the Workmen's Compensation Act relieves claimants of the burden of proving proximate cause, it mandates that an injury be a ""producing cause"" of the death or disability to be compensable. The appellate court will rule that this instruction to the jury about the legal effect of their answers was improper and constituted reversible error.

Critically, the wrong instruction is likely to be perceived as coercing the jury to find ""good cause,"" potentially influencing their decision to rule in favor of the appellees. The court will highlight the importance of an unimpaired deliberative process by the jury, which must be free of guidance regarding the implications of their determinations.

On the substance of the case itself, the appellate court will find that there remains a factual issue regarding whether Burnett's work-related injury was a ""producing cause"" of his death that a jury should resolve without improper guidance from the court. The appellate court will also reference previous case law emphasizing the necessity of proving a continuous chain of causation that is not interrupted by an independent agency unless the injury operates through the independent agency and contributes to the resulting condition or death.

Despite the error in jury instruction, the appellate court will not necessarily negate the underlying causation findings. Instead, it will remand for a new trial where these issues can be properly addressed and decided based on lawful court instructions and without improperly influencing the jury's responses."
"Eugenio Pinok, an employee at Wald-Tinkle Packaging & Distribution, Inc., was injured while stacking bags off a conveyor system. The accident occurred when his arm became stuck between the conveyor belt and the rollers as he attempted to free a jammed bag, without shutting off the power first. Pinok pursued Wald-Tinkle on the grounds of negligence, claiming the company failed to properly train him, warn of the dangers of removing jammed bags, and maintain a safe working environment due to maladjusted rollers.

Pinok's initial job training was largely observational, learning from co-workers. On the injury date, October 17, 2000, Pinok sustained an abrasive third-degree burn. He received medical treatment until February 14, 2001, but only performed light duty until early December 2000 due to his injury. He ceased working for Wald-Tinkle in December 2000 and started a new job in April 2001.

During the trial, Wald-Tinkle objected to the admission of evidence regarding failure to train and warn Pinok, as those theories were not included in Pinok's initial-disclosure responses and were only supplemented shortly before trial. The court determined Wald-Tinkle waived their objection by failing to object during trial. It was deemed that there was at least implicit good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice for the untimely supplementation.

Additionally, Wald-Tinkle contested having any duty to warn or train Pinok against removing stuck bags without powering down the conveyor. However, evidence showed Wald-Tinkle was aware of the danger, and Pinok was accustomed to removing bags in an unsafe manner that he'd observed from co-workers. There were also conflicting testimonies as to whether Pinok was ever formally trained on safe bag removal methods. A jury found Wald-Tinkle negligent and awarded Pinok $73,949.63 in damages; the trial court granted Wald-Tinkle's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) only in part, dismissing $8,000 awarded for past and future physical impairment.","Affirming the judgment, the court reasoned that Wald-Tinkle had a legal duty to either warn Pinok of the dangers associated with removing bags from the conveyor or to train him on how to safely address the issue. The detail that Pinok observed bag removal procedures from his co-workers, who themselves may have been improperly trained, combined with sufficient evidence that Wald-Tinkle was aware of this inappropriate practice, fulfills the standard for proving the company's duty to properly warn or train Pinok. Concluding that Wald-Tinkle had indeed neglected this duty, the verdict supports the jury's finding of negligence based on a breach of the duty to train or warn and the maladjustment negligence claim.

Regarding damages, the custodian of record affidavits regarding medical expenses, which were not countered by Wald-Tinkle, validated the jury's award for past medical expenses as reasonable. Wald-Tinkle's payment records and Pinok's testimony allowed for supporting an award of lost wages during the period Pinok ceased working at Wald-Tinkle until finding new employment. 

Sole proximate cause was also properly instructed in the charge, and the new and independent cause did not apply here as there was no separate force or party responsible for Pinok's injury. Given that Pinok was able to perform everyday life and work activities as before the accident, no distinct evidence was provided to support an award for physical impairment separate from pain and suffering or disfigurement. Thus, the dismissal of the $8,000 award for physical impairment was justified, and the judgment in favor of Pinok on his non-subscriber negligence claims is affirmed."
"The case involves the appellant, a railway company, which sought to overturn a judgment made by the District Court of Bell County, Texas. This original judgment was in favor of the appellee, a customer of the railway, who filed an action for damages against the company, citing that the company's ticket agent had communicated smallpox to him and subsequently to his wife.

The customer had purchased two roundtrip tickets from the ticket agent, who, at the time, was suffering from smallpox. Consequently, the customer contracted the disease from the agent and later passed it on to his wife. The customer alleged that the railway company was responsible for the damages he and his wife sustained due to the wrongful act of its agent. The company, in its defense, proposed that there was an intervening cause, specifically the act of the customer himself passing the disease to his wife, which should absolve the company of direct responsibility for the wife's infection.

The trial court ruled in the customer's favor, leading the railway company to appeal. The appeals court supported the original ruling, maintaining that the ticket agent's act was the proximate cause of both the customer's and his wife's contraction of smallpox. Furthermore, it was held that the company owed it to the public to protect them from being exposed to contagious diseases through its agents.

The railway’s defense included the argument that the agent, named Bridges, being neither the principal station agent nor the responsible representative but merely a subordinate without control over employment decisions, did not have his knowledge of the disease imputed to the company. The appellee's representation, on the other hand, held that any damages directly resulting from the agent's wrongful act were the responsibility of the company.","The court will affirm the judgment in favor of the customer, reasoning that it was the duty of the railway company to prevent their agents, who interact with the public, from communicating contagious diseases to customers. It will predict that the court will hold that such agents, when acting within the scope of their authority and performing their duties, indeed represent the company. Therefore, their knowledge of their contagious condition is also attributable to the railway company itself.

The court will likely explain that the proximate cause relates to whether an act is the natural and probable consequence of negligence or a wrongful act, which should have been foreseen by the perpetrator. In this case, the act of selling tickets to the customer while the agent was afflicted by smallpox was a wrongful act with foreseeable and natural consequences, especially given the personal and close contact inherent in the relationship between spouses.

It will be predicted that the court will reject the appellant's contention that knowledge of the agent's smallpox should not be considered knowledge on the part of the company because the testimony supported the idea that the agent was authorized and actively engaged in his role at the time of the exposure.

The court will likely affirm that since the circumstances made it natural and probable that the customer would contract smallpox from the agent and communicate it to his wife, the railway company is liable for the damages sustained as a direct and proximate result of the agent’s wrongful act. 

To further support the decision, it is also probable that the court will reference the distinction between duties owed to the public that do not allow for individual action and duties intended for the individual members of the public which can lead to individual actions when breached. Cases such as the appellee's will fall into the latter category.

In conclusion, the court will affirm the judgment of the lower court, agreeing that the appellant, through its agent, was liable for the damages endured by the customer resulting from the agent's actions within the scope of his employment, the precedent being established that companies must safeguard the public against communicable diseases carried by their agents."
"The case revolves around a helicopter crash involving a Eurocopter AS 355 F2 Twinstar, owned by Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina and operated by CJ Systems Aviation Group (CJ). The crash, which resulted in the death of the pilot, John Holland, was attributed to the failure of the main rotor gearbox. American Eurocopter Corporation (American), responsible for overhauling the gearbox, was sued by the deceased pilot's family and settled the claim for $2,250,000. Duke's insurer also attempted to sue American to recover the amount paid for the helicopter loss, but that litigation ended in a verdict favorable to American.

Subsequently, American sued CJ for contractual indemnity, seeking to recover the settlement amount and attorney's fees. CJ counterclaimed for breach of warranty on the failed gearbox. A jury trial took place, which resulted in a take-nothing judgment on American's claims against CJ and an award of $78,935.62 to CJ on its counterclaim. 

Before the crash, CJ's mechanic examined the gearbox, which had shown an oil-pressure warning light during a flight, but determined that the issue was likely a faulty oil-pressure switch, a common problem, which did not render the helicopter unsafe for a ferry flight to perform further maintenance. The mechanic disconnected the warning light on the pilot's request to avoid distraction and approved the second flight back to Duke, which ended in a crash caused by gearbox failure due to lack of cooling lubrication. The gearbox had been certified as airworthy by American despite failing multiple rotation bench tests mandated by Eurocopter's overhaul manuals.

The Service Center Agreement between CJ and American included a provision in which CJ agreed to indemnify American for losses ""arising from services furnished and work performed"" by CJ. This provision came into question during the trial regarding its application to indemnification for American's own negligence and that of CJ's concurrent negligence.","The court affirmed the judgment in favor of CJ for several reasons. Analyzing the express negligence doctrine, the court predicted that the parties' intent to indemnify for American's own negligence and application to CJ's concurrent negligence were not stated in clear, unambiguous terms within the contract. This omission barred American's claim for indemnity.

The court also predicted that the jury's finding of American's negligence as a proximate cause of the accident would be supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence. It was foreseeable that the second flight, deemed necessary by CJ's mechanic and pilot due to the perceived nature of the gearbox problem, could have been anticipated by American. Furthermore, the gearbox posed an imminent failure risk, which was the direct cause of the crash, linking American’s negligence as a cause in fact of the accident. American's negligence in certifying the gearbox as airworthy, despite failed bench tests, was a substantial factor in the eventual crash, and the gearbox's dangers had not come to rest after the first flight, as American argued.

As for CJ's counterclaim for breach of warranty, the court predicted that American’s defense concerning the disclaimer and remedy limitation within the warranty would not hold because they were not proven as affirmative defenses during the trial. CJ's reliance on the express warranty that the parts would be free from defects was valid, and damages were appropriately awarded as the failed gearbox was a direct result of American's defective overhauling work, constituting a breach of that warranty.

In summary, the prediction would be that the court did not err in its legal interpretations and application of the evidence, denying American's motions and supporting CJ's awarded damages, resulting in the affirmation of the lower court's judgment."
"The patient, Carlton Shuffield, as a minor represented by his father as next friend, filed a lawsuit against Dr. G. B. Taylor for damages related to alleged medical malpractice during a tonsillectomy. Shuffield claimed that Dr. Taylor not only performed a tonsillectomy but also removed his uvula, palate, and tonsillar pillars without parental consent, which he alleged resulted in loss of speech, hearing, and reduced mental capacity. Shuffield asserted Dr. Taylor was negligent in performing the surgery and in treating his adenoids and suppurating ears. Dr. Taylor denied these claims, contending that Shuffield's speech and hearing issues were congenital defects present from birth, and that any surgery performed did not cause, aggravate, or worsen his conditions.

The trial court found in favor of Shuffield, and the jury supported the claims of malpractice, resulting in damages awarded to Shuffield. However, the case was appealed, primarily over the admissibility of the parents' testimony. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the decision based on the contention that the parents' testimony about Shuffield's medical history was nonexpert and thus inadmissible. The appeal focused on whether nonexpert witnesses, such as parents, could testify regarding the apparent presence of disease or the change in their child's physical condition. The appeal also addressed issues around the expert testimony on hypothetical questions raised based on assumed facts and the refusal of certain special issues requested by the defendant.

The case involved complex considerations about expert versus nonexpert testimony, the framing of hypothetical questions, ultimate versus evidentiary issues, and the broader implications of a doctor's treatment actions, including preexisting conditions, parental consent, and the extent of medical procedures performed.}

{","The decision to exclude the parents' testimony would be reversed, given that such testimony is admissible due to their personal familiarities, such as frequent opportunities for observation, which enables them to speak on their son’s general health, strength, and physical changes, although they are not experts. The rejection of the parents' testimony overlooked established precedent that non-experts are competent to express opinions on certain physical conditions, like sickness or health, based on observations and facts.

Furthermore, it would be found that the hypothetical questions presented to medical experts were valid even if they only included part of the facts in evidence as they contained enough information for the experts to establish an opinion. It is permissible for either party to incorporate facts supported by evidence into their hypothetical questions, and it is not essential for hypothetical questions to include all facts under conflicting theories of the case.

Regarding the special issues requested by the defendant, the higher court will predict that they were rightly rejected as they were not ultimate issues but instead evidentiary and did not clearly differentiate between congenital and acquired conditions, nor did they clearly establish the timing of the disease in relation to the tonsillectomy. Only ultimate issues are required to be submitted to the jury.

With regards to the excluded testimony of Dr. Key, it will be upheld as not responsive, hearsay, a conclusion of the witness, and less preferable than the direct evidence provided by the record, according to the principle that the record itself is the best evidence and that the excluded response was a recollection of hearsay information that was already presented through the record admitted into evidence.

In summary, the higher court will conclude that the parents' testimony was improperly excluded, the hypothetical questions were sufficient for eliciting expert testimony, the requested special issues were rightly refused, and the exclusion of Dr. Key's testimonial was proper. Thus, the Court of Civil Appeals' judgment will be overruled, and the original trial court's decision in favor of Carlton Shuffield will be affirmed.}"
"Plaintiff consumers, here represented collectively as McGuire, filed separate actions against defendants, various alcohol producers and the Distilled Spirits Council (collectively referred to as Seagram), seeking damages for injuries and losses allegedly caused by the addictive nature of alcohol. The plaintiffs invoked several legal theories, such as negligence, breaches of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness, conspiracy, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

In their complaints, McGuire outlined a multitude of ways in which Seagram allegedly failed to warn consumers about the dangers of alcohol, arguing Seagram should have provided information on alcohol being a depressant, its toxicity to bodily organs, the potential for addiction, and the various health issues associated with excessive consumption. Separate claims were made asserting that Seagram had a duty to warn because the dangers of alcohol consumption were not commonly known to an ordinary consumer.

Moreover, the plaintiffs pointed to the Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 402A (1965), which deals with strict liability of the seller for selling a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer, claiming that the defendants did not offer sufficient warnings or instructions for the safe use of their alcoholic products.

Seagram's defense primarily rested on the argument that the dangers associated with alcohol consumption were common knowledge and therefore there was no duty to warn the public about them. Additionally, multiple special exceptions argued that the lawsuit lacked a legal basis, was not supportable by the law of strict product liability, and that a product legally manufactured and safe for consumption in limited amounts could not expose the manufacturer to strict product liability.

The 58th District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, agreed with the defendants' arguments, sustaining the special exceptions and dismissing the plaintiffs' actions with prejudice, a decision that prompted the plaintiffs to appeal.","The appellate court held that in deciding the case, it was required to accept all of the allegations and material facts contained within the plaintiffs' petitions as true. Based on this assumption, the court found that the plaintiffs' pleadings did indeed state a cause of action under both negligence and strict liability theories and thus the dismissal with prejudice by the district court based on the special exceptions was improper.

The appellate court was to address whether there existed a legal duty on behalf of the alcohol producers and the distilled spirits council to warn consumers about the dangers of alcohol. It was to determine if the common knowledge argument presented by the defendants was a sufficient defense to the failure to warn claims. The court might explore whether beverage alcohol, given its addictive qualities and potential health risks as pleaded by McGuire, could be deemed an unreasonably dangerous product requiring warnings beyond what might be commonly known. 

The court would consider the advancements in scientific knowledge regarding the effects of alcohol, and whether this knowledge imposed a duty on the manufacturers to warn the general public, specifically those potentially genetically predisposed to alcoholism or unaware of alcohol's addictive nature. It was likely to evaluate the alleged negligence of Seagram in failing to provide adequate warnings and instructions for safe consumption of their products, thus rendering these products unreasonably dangerous.

If the product's dangerousness due to inadequate warnings and the failure to instruct as to safe use was established by the plaintiffs, this could potentially render the product defective under strict liability principles. For McGuire's claims based on misrepresentation, the court would have to decide if justifiable reliance on Seagram's advertisements led to McGuire's injuries.

Considering these factors, the court would have concluded that McGuire stated valid legal claims, reversing the lower court's judgment and remanding the case for trial. At trial, the plaintiffs would then have the opportunity to present evidence to support the allegations in their petitions and seek remedies for any actionable injuries. The appellate court was to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.

Consequently, the predictions about the verdict are that the appellate court would likely have found that the district court erred in dismissing the case with prejudice and that a more comprehensive examination of the factual allegations and the applicability of legal theories was warranted. However, whether the plaintiffs' evidence would have been sufficient to prevail in a trial remained to be seen, as the decision was to be based on the evidence presented and not just the pleadings."
"Terry Campbell, the appellant, initiated a malpractice action against his former criminal defense attorney, Edward A. Mallett, the appellee. Campbell claimed that due to Mallett's negligence in preparing his defense, he was coerced into pleading guilty to federal procurement fraud and obstruction of justice. In response to these malpractice claims, Mallett filed a motion for summary judgment.

Prior to the malpractice suit, Campbell, his sister, a business associate, and two of Campbell's corporations were indicted on several counts related to federal procurement fraud and obstruction of justice. As part of a plea agreement, which entailed the dismissal of most charges and a lighter application of the sentencing guidelines, Campbell pled guilty to one count of fraud and one count of obstruction. Campbell was then sentenced to five years in prison. In his malpractice suit, he alleged he was coerced into this guilty plea and accused Mallett of breach of warranty under the DTPA, violation of disciplinary rules, and sought damages for himself and his family.

The court granted partial summary judgment in Mallett’s favor regarding all parties and causes of action, except for Campbell’s claim of negligence. This remaining negligence claim was also later granted summary judgment in Mallett's favor. Campbell appealed this decision, asserting that Mallett’s motion wasn’t well-founded. The appeal court's established review process required the movant for summary judgment to demonstrate an absence of any material fact issue and an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, taking all evidence favorably towards the non-movant, which in this case, was Campbell.

During the criminal proceeding, Campbell had confirmed under oath to the judge that he pled guilty freely and voluntarily and that he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation. Based on the testimony, Campbell admitted to the criminal conduct he was accused of. This testimony was used as evidence to support Mallett's motion for summary judgment. In response, Campbell provided a transcript from a hearing on his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and an affidavit asserting that Mallett admitted to little trial preparation, alongside urging Campbell to plead guilty.","The court will affirm the summary judgment granted in favor of Mallett. The verdict will be supported by the reasoning that Mallett, as the movant, successfully demonstrated an absence of one essential element of Campbell's malpractice claim. In legal malpractice actions, Campbell would have needed to establish that he had a meritorious defense and that, but for Mallett's purported negligence, he could have proven this defense leading to a different outcome at trial. Campbell's sworn testimony during the criminal proceeding, wherein he admitted his guilt and expressed satisfaction with his counsel, would irreparably undermine his negligence claim. Furthermore, the court will note that this admission implies Campbell cannot establish that Mallett's actions were the proximate cause of his conviction; rather, it was his own criminal conduct.

The evidence that Campbell presented in his appeal, including the attempt to withdraw his guilty plea and the purported lack of trial preparation by Mallett, would fail to raise a material fact issue regarding the proximate cause of Campbell's damages. The affidavits and testimony submitted by Campbell would support the judgment and fall short in demonstrating that any negligence on Mallett’s part led to Campbell's plea. Campbell would be judicially estopped from asserting coercion in his guilty plea because of his prior contradictory oath. The court will find no issues with the reliance on Tijerina v. Wennermark, as the essential reasoning from this prior case — that the admitted guilt of a crime by a defendant without coercion establishes a lack of merit in defense and precludes malpractice claims — would apply to Campbell's case. As a result, Campbell would have failed to meet the shifted burden of establishing the existence of a material fact question by not demonstrating any proof of his innocence or defense against the accusations.

In sum, the court's affirmation of the summary judgment would rest on Campbell's failure to prove Mallett's negligence proximately caused his damages, the absence of a meritorious defense, and the fact that Campbell admitted guilt under oath and cannot claim a forced plea."
"Patricia Rogers suffered severe injuries, and Patricia Howell died following liposuction surgery performed by Dr. Hugo Ramirez. After complications, they were treated by a team including Dr. Ramirez, Dr. Brian Bradley, Dr. Anibal Hadad, and Dr. Margarita Muniz at Humana Hospital Southmore. They contracted infections, and plaintiffs alleged the defendant doctors, including Dr. Bradley, were negligent for not diagnosing sooner. A jury found Dr. Bradley jointly and severally liable for substantial damages. Dr. Bradley appealed on various grounds, including the lack of proximate cause evidence.

The surgery occurred on March 27, 1987. Dr. Ramirez used the same cannula on both Rogers and Howell and instructed them to wear special girdles post-surgery. They became critically ill by late Sunday afternoon. Howell was hydrated, given blood and oxygen, and Rogers vomited blood. Both had low blood pressure and were admitted to the hospital. Initially treated for shock and potential GI bleed by Dr. Ramirez and the emergency room doctors, they were later transferred to ICU under Dr. Hadad and eventually treated for septic shock by Dr. Bradley.

During the assessment, Howell and Rogers' conditions worsened, with Howell becoming unresponsive. Dr. Bradley ruled out pulmonary embolism, treated them for septic shock from infection, and suspected necrotizing fasciitis. Despite aggressive therapy, Howell died during surgery at St. Luke's Hospital, and Rogers survived with multiple subsequent surgeries.

The trial involving Howell's survivors and Rogers lasted three months, after which the jury found Dr. Ramirez 75% at fault and Dr. Bradley 25% at fault for Howell; Dr. Ramirez 50% and Drs. Hadad and Bradley each 25% for Rogers. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict but the defendants made post-verdict motions denied by the trial court, leading to Dr. Bradley's appeal. The appeal contested the evidence's legal and factual sufficiency, especially regarding the causation of Howell's death and Rogers' injuries, and the connection to Dr. Bradley's actions.","The verdict of the case reversed the judgment against Dr. Bradley due to an absence of proximate cause, meaning there was no evidence Dr. Bradley's negligence was a substantial factor in causing Howell's death or Rogers' injuries. The appellate court concluded that liability for the lost chance of survival is an impermissible assignment of responsibility based on mere possibility. Despite expert testimonies on the importance of early surgery and debridement, it was determined the evidence did not meet the threshold of reasonable medical probability necessary for establishing causation in medical malpractice cases. 

The court stated that plaintiffs did not manage to prove Dr. Bradley's failure to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis earlier and to recommend surgery before Monday 8:00 a.m. caused Howell’s death and the extensive debridement Rogers required. There was no evidence offered that was more than a mere possibility. Expert testimony about a patient generally faring better with quicker debridement was found too generic and not directly applicable or specific enough to the case at hand. The appellate court emphasized that establishing causation required more than showing a better chance for survival; there must be evidence suggesting that without Dr. Bradley's alleged negligence, the harm would not have occurred.

The judges also found that while the complications suffered by Howell and Rogers were severe due to existing infections from liposuction, the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that Dr. Bradley's actions or omissions significantly worsened their conditions. As such, the appellate court reversed the trial court's verdict and rendered a take-nothing judgment for Dr. Bradley, meaning the plaintiffs could not recover any damages from him. The appeal court did not need to address other points because the issue of proximate cause was decisive."
"Plaintiffs Charles Gragson and his wife filed a premises liability lawsuit against M.E.&E. Welding & Fabrication, Inc. following an incident where Charles Gragson, an employee of Anchor Crane & Hoist, Inc., fell through a hole in a roof. The hole had been created and covered by a sheet of plywood by M.E.&E. The 124th Judicial District Court in Gregg County, Texas, ruled in favor of a take-nothing judgment, effectively ruling against the employee and his wife. They then appealed the decision.

The case presented Charles Gragson as a new employee with only thirteen days of employment at Anchor Crane. He was receiving on-the-job training and was on the roof with senior service technician Roy Riffel to replace a motor on a crane. The hole, over the top of a paint room, had been created to allow the lifting of heavy items with a crane. Although Riffel was aware of the hole, evidence regarding whether Gragson had been informed about it was conflicting. When M.E.&E. offered scaffolding to ensure safety, Riffel declined, citing time constraints. Safety gear such as safety belts, tie-offs, and lanyards were in the Anchor Crane truck, but neither Riffel nor Gragson utilized them.

The jury concluded that Anchor Crane's conduct was the sole proximate cause of Gragson's injuries, thereby excluding M.E.&E. from liability. The court then assessed costs against Wausau, the workers' compensation carrier that had intervened in the lawsuit seeking recovery for money paid to Gragson. On appeal, Gragson challenged the submission of a jury question on sole proximate cause, claiming there was no legal or factual basis for it and that the evidence did not support the jury's response. Wausau additionally challenged the assessment of all taxable court costs against it, arguing that it should not bear the entire cost due to its limited involvement in the proceedings.","The appeals court stated that questions and instructions that are raised by evidence must be submitted to the jury, and juries are entitled to deliberate on the doctrine of sole proximate cause if the evidence supports it. They determined that the evidence indicated that Anchor Crane 1) knew of the hole, 2) did not inform Gragson about it, 3) refused the offer to set up a scaffold, 4) chose not to use available safety equipment, 5) failed to instruct Gragson on safety measures for working at a height, and 6) did not inspect the work area prior to beginning repairs. This evidence substantiated the submission of the sole proximate cause defense and supported the verdict.

Moreover, the appellate court found that Gragson failed to preserve his argument that a sole proximate cause question could only be submitted as an instruction, not as a question, by not objecting during trial. The jury's determination of sole proximate cause was also found legally and factually sufficient. The foreseeability of the injury due to Anchor Crane's conduct and inaction was held to be reasonable given the evidence.

With regard to taxable court costs, the appellate court agreed that the trial court acted within its discretion by assessing Wausau for court costs due to its substantial financial interest in the case, represented by a lien on any recovery amount. Nonetheless, the appeals court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by charging Wausau with all the costs, given its minimal participation in the lawsuit compared to Gragson. The judgment was reformed to assess costs jointly and severally against both Gragson and Wausau.

As a result, the appeals court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects except for the allocation of court costs, which they reformed. They upheld the jury's finding that Anchor Crane's actions were the sole proximate cause of Gragson's injuries, absolving M.E.&E. of liability in the premises liability suit. Moreover, they supported the decision that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury's verdict and denied Gragson's numerous grounds for appeal."
"This case arises from a tragic and fatal accident on a construction site at the OK Corral Night Club in February 2009. Jaime Membreno, an employee of Luis Romero d/b/a Luis Romero Construction (Romero) and part of the stucco crew, was fatally injured when he came into contact with a power line while standing on a metal scaffold and holding a 10-foot roll of metal mesh near the City of Austin's power line. Membreno was electrocuted while using metal wire-cutters on the mesh.

The City of Austin, also referred to as Austin Energy, owned the power line, which had been installed on the west side of the property in 1975 following an easement obtained in 1972. In November 2008, Saljar, the entity that operated the nightclub, remodeled the building and acted as the general contractor for the project. Saljar hired Romero for applying stucco around the building and submitted a construction permit application with a site plan that inaccurately omitted any indication that construction work would be performed on the west side of the building where the power line was located. The leasing documents failed to disclose a building overhang that extended the building three feet closer to the power lines.

Romero and his crew erected scaffolding that was dangerously close to the City's power lines. Despite the Texas Health and Safety Code and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations requiring de-energization of power lines for work performed within six feet, no one from Saljar or the crew contacted Austin Energy to request the lines be de-energized. 

Evidence presented at trial included photographs and sketches of the accident site, showing the proximity of the scaffold to the power line. Testimony from various witness including Austin Energy employees, and Membreno Lopez, the mother of the deceased's son, provided additional information about the site plan, the erection of the scaffolding, and the events leading up to the electrocution.

Maria Del Rosario Membreno Lopez, as Next Friend of Jaime Antonio Membreno Lopez (Membreno Lopez), sued the City for negligence and negligence per se on behalf of her minor child, claiming that Membreno was her child's father and sole heir. Membreno Lopez alleged that the City had been negligent in its operation, maintenance, and inspection of the utility line, leading to the dangerous condition that caused Membreno's death. Additionally, it was claimed that the City should have denied the construction permit to Saljar due to the omission of essential information regarding the scope of work and proximity to power lines.

The City's cross-claims alleged that Romero and Saljar, in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code, should indemnify the City for liability incurred due to Membreno's contact with the power line. Saljar similarly raised evidentiary sufficiency issues, contesting the apportionment of responsibility under Texas law.

The jury found the City, Romero, Saljar, and Membreno negligent, with varying degrees of responsibility. The jury also determined that Membreno Lopez's child is Membreno's biological son, concluding in a substantial award in damages. The trial court signed a final judgment ordering the City to pay damages and ordering Saljar and Romero to indemnify the City for the same amount. Both the City and Saljar appealed.","In addressing the City's appeal, it will be concluded that Membreno Lopez's allegations and expert’s testimony established that the City had a duty to exercise ""good utility practice,"" involving regular inspection of power lines and poles. Given the City’s failure to remedy the leaning pole, which moved the power line too close to the building, this will be found as a breach of duty. The City’s negligence will be recognized as a proximate cause of Membreno's injuries, as expert testimony indicated that straightening the pole would have placed the line further from the building, avoiding the accident. 

Regarding the determination of Membreno Lopez's child as Membreno's legal heir, the verdict will affirm the findings. It will be established that paternity adjudication at trial was sufficient to confer heirship status upon the child under Estates Code Section 201.001 and Family Code Section 160.201.

Turning to Saljar's cross-appeal, the court will determine that Question No. 8 was not fatally defective and sufficiently reflected the statutory focus on responsibility for the proximity of the work to power lines. It will be established that Saljar controlled the detail crucial to the statute—the decision to have stucco applied on the west-wall overhang within six feet of the power lines. As the entity that decided where the work would occur, Saljar will be affirmed as the ""person responsible"" under Chapter 752 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

In conclusion, the judgment against the City and Saljar will be affirmed, upholding Membreno Lopez's negligence claim and the City's right to indemnification from Saljar and Romero for the damages awarded."
"Ronnie Tejada was incarcerated in Jefferson County Jail from November 2004 to October 2005, during which NaphCare, Inc. administered medical care for inmates under contract with the county. NaphCare hired Dr. Virgilio Gernale to provide physician services.

On intake, Tejada reported a personal history of diabetes but no current problems or medication for the condition. Throughout his incarceration, he presented several health complaints, including pain in various parts of his body and deteriorating vision, but he did not specifically complain about diabetes-related issues. Still, Gernale, who was aware of Tejada's diabetes history, did not perform a blood sugar test.

In July 2005, Gernale conducted a chart review and noted the inability to find a neurosurgeon for Tejada's head pains due to his inmate status. Gernale ordered that Tejada should be sent to the emergency room if an emergency situation arose. By October 2005, Tejada's condition had significantly worsened, leading him to the emergency room with a blood sugar level of 460 mg/dL. He was diagnosed with severe hyperglycemia, dehydration, and malnutrition. Within a month, both of Tejada's legs were amputated below the knees.

The Tejadas filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Gernale, alleging that his failure to test for, treat, or follow up on Tejada's diabetes caused the injuries. They argued they filed within the applicable limitations period, specifying July 12, 2005, as the date of Gernale's malpractice when he reviewed Tejada's chart and failed to order a blood sugar test or ensure proper follow-up. 

To support their case, the Tejadas provided expert testimony from endocrinologist Philip Raskin, who stated that Gernale neglected the standard of care by not testing Tejada's blood sugar levels, leading to the injuries. Despite this, the trial court awarded summary judgment to Gernale, potentially based on statute of limitations and res judicata related to a previous federal case against other defendants, where Gernale was not added as a defendant.","The appellate court will likely reverse the summary judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings. The reversal will be based on determining that the limitations period has not run out as the suit alleges acts of medical negligence by Gernale within the limitations period, notably the July 12 chart review being a clearly ascertainable date of malpractice.

The court will also find that res judicata is not applicable in this case, as Gernale was neither a party to the prior federal case nor in privity with a party. There's insufficient evidence that NaphCare, which was involved in the federal action, was acting in a representative capacity or that the federal court viewed NaphCare as protecting Gernale's interests. Therefore, Gernale's contention that NaphCare adequately represented his interests in the federal lawsuit and that privity exists will be rejected.

Lastly, the appellate court will identify a factual issue concerning causation. Expert testimony from Raskin will be considered sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Gernale's alleged negligence proximately caused Tejada's injuries. The expert's opinion will be found to satisfy the requirement of demonstrating that Gernale's failure to test, evaluate, and treat Tejada's diabetes was a substantial factor in causing the injuries sustained, leading to his bilateral leg amputations.

Thus, the appellate court will point out that Gernale has failed to show that his affirmative defenses conclusively bar the Tejadas' claims, and since some evidence suggests Gernale's negligence resulted in Tejada's injuries, the trial court's granting of summary judgment will be considered premature and will be reversed."
"In February 1952, the patient Elvira Louise Swartout was taken to a hospital and clinic operated by appellees Dr. R. D. Holt and Dr. J. T. Archer, Jr., in Meridian, Texas, due to abdominal pain and nausea. Dr. Holt recommended surgical intervention, which was scheduled for February 28, 1952. The parents informed Dr. Holt about their daughter's prior negative reaction to ether anesthesia during a tonsillectomy that required resuscitation. Despite the parents’ objections to the use of ether and the promise of spinal anesthesia, ether was administered, resulting in the patient’s death on March 2, 1952.

The parents of Elvira, appellants in this case, subsequently filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the appellee doctors. During the first trial, the jury could not reach a verdict, leading to a mistrial. In a second trial, the jury found in favor of the doctors. The parents claimed they informed Dr. Holt of the patient's previous reaction to anesthesia, which the doctors denied. The jury verdict found that the parents did not sufficiently inform Dr. Holt about the anesthesia allergy before the administration of ether and that no negligence resulted from this failure. As such, the child’s death was deemed an unavoidable accident, and no pecuniary loss was suffered by the parents as a result. The appellants challenged the trial's outcome through a motion for a new trial on the basis that the jury was not impartial, particularly focusing on juror C. E. Dansby who potentially had a conflict of interest.","The court rejected the appellants' claim of an impartial jury, citing there was no restriction on the voir dire (preliminary examination of a witness or a juror by a judge or counsel) process by the trial court. Also, there was no substantial evidence presented that would lead one to conclusively determine that Mr. Dansby conducted himself with partiality or bias. Given the jurors' verdict, the burden of proof for medical malpractice and the cause of the child's death falling on the appellants was not met, as defined by the precedent that a diagnosis or treatment must be proven negligent and causally connected to the injuries by a physician from the same school of practice. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence showcasing misconduct by the juror in question or any indication that the jury as a whole did not perform their duties impartially.

In consideration of these factors, the appellate court will predict that the denial of the motion for a new trial by the trial court did not constitute an abuse of discretion. There wasn't a substantial likelihood that any alleged misconduct by juror C. E. Dansby critically impacted the trial outcome. As such, the appellants have not convincingly demonstrated that they were deprived of a right to an unbiased and fair trial due to juror misconduct. Therefore, the verdict of the trial court will be affirmed, and the parents will not receive relief from the suit against the doctors."
"The case involves a railway accident in which a passenger was riding on a train operated by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company when it was struck by a freight train from the defendant railway company at a crossing. The collision did not involve a direct physical impact on the plaintiff's body, as he was not knocked off his seat but it caused him considerable fright. The plaintiff filed a negligence action against the railway company, seeking damages for personal injuries, claiming that the accident led to a nervous disorder known as traumatic neurasthenia. This condition was alleged to have been caused either by the physical jolt of the train's abrupt stop or the mental shock from the fright, or both. The trial court charged the jury with determining if the railway company's negligence led directly to the passenger's physical or mental shock, which then caused a disease or sickness. The jury found in favor of the passenger. The railway company argued that damages for fright or shock that do not accompany any physical injury or disturbance are not recoverable. They contended that such injuries are rare and not reasonably anticipated as a proximate result of negligence. Conversely, counsel for the defendant in error argued that if a railway company's negligence leads to a position of imminent peril that causes fright, and this fright then leads to illness, the negligence is the proximate cause of the injury and is actionable. They maintained that even if the physical harm consists mainly of nervous shock resulting in disease, the negligence can establish liability for fright. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment.","Given the fact that the railway company's negligence resulted in a collision which caused direct mental and physical shock to the plaintiff, leading to the development of his condition (traumatic neurasthenia), the jury verdict is likely to be affirmed by the higher court. The reasoning will likely focus on the recognition of mental shock as a possible cause of physical injury when it is a direct result of negligence. This view is informed by modern science which acknowledges that mental emotions like fright can have tangible physical effects, such as in this case, where a mental shock resulted in a debilitating nervous disorder. The court's analysis will likely revolve around the concept of proximate cause, and whether the mental and resultant physical injuries could have been a foreseeable consequence of the railway company's negligence. Looking at the specific circumstances of this case, it's probable that the court will conclude that the foreseeable nature of the injuries and the proximate cause condition is satisfied. Therefore, the court's detailed reasoning will hinge on the significance of recognizing both mental and physical repercussions of a wrongful act, even if the injuries primarily involve mental or emotional disturbances with subsequent physical manifestations. The precedent set by prior similar cases and the testimony provided about the effects of fright on physical health will likely contribute to buttressing the validity of the plaintiff's claim and the decision to affirm the jury's verdict in favor of the passenger."
"The plaintiff, the beneficiary, sought to recover death benefits under an insurance policy issued by the defendant insurer after the insured, Q. V. Miller, was injured in an automobile collision and died almost three months later. Trial court entered judgment for the beneficiary, and the insurer appealed. The dispute centered on whether there was sufficient evidence to support the medical cause of death as accidental and linked to the injury from the car accident. Key facts and testimonies include:

1. Q. V. Miller sustained injuries from a car collision on May 25, 1954, and died on August 17, 1954, within the specified 90-day coverage period outlined in the insurance policy for loss of life due to accidental injury.
2. The beneficiary of the policy is Q. V. Miller's surviving wife.
3. Medical evidence was largely based on the testimony of Drs. Kelly and Chandler, who treated Miller post-accident.
4. Lay witness testimonies corroborated the occurrence and immediate effects of the car accident on Miller.
5. The jury trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the beneficiary, awarding $1,000, penalty, attorney’s fee, and interest.
6. The insurer's appeal contested the causal connection between the accidental injury and the death, the qualification and testimony of Dr. Chandler, jury instructions, and the granting of penalty and attorney fees.
7. Dr. Kelly diagnosed Q. V. Miller with a cerebral concussion and signs of brain damage due to the accident.
8. Dr. Chandler, who oversaw Miller's care post-transfer from Austin to Ballinger, attributed Miller's death to a cerebral hemorrhage resulting from the concussion.
9. The insurer argued there was insufficient evidence to show a reasonable probability that the accident caused Miller's death and contested the jury's evaluation of proximate cause.
10. The trial court was also questioned for awarding the beneficiary penalty and attorney fees, suggesting a lack of demand for payment under the policy and the statutory waiting period before filing suit had not expired.","The verdict of the trial court was affirmed, with the appellate court holding that:

1. The issue of the cause of death was appropriately submitted to the jury based on the expert medical testimonies of Drs. Kelly and Chandler, who provided a qualified opinion on the connection between the accidental injury and Miller's subsequent death.
2. The jury was correctly entitled to consider the cause of death based on the evidentiary standard of showing a reasonable probability, not certainty, that the accidental injury resulted in Miller's death.
3. The trial court did not err in awarding a penalty and attorney fees per Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 3.62 because the insurer had acknowledged a claim presented, asserted a denial of liability, and the statutory period for waiting post-demand had lapsed prior to suit being filed, validating the beneficiary's entitlement to these awards.
4. The court found no reversible error in the exclusion of the insurer's Exhibit 2, nor in Dr. Chandler's testimony, as his statements were understood to convey his opinion rather than a conclusory assertion lacking probative value.
5. No error was raised by the insurer's motion for mistrial based on a lay witness's statement as it did not affect the outcome given the context of the statement and the overall evidence.
6. The trial court accurately instructed the jury on proximate cause, and the appeals court found the charge to the jury did not omit controlling issues as it contained appropriate definitions and submissions.
7. The jury was entrusted with the task of determining a reasonable attorney's fee, consistent with the evidence and limitations outlined in Art. 3.62.

Consequently, the appellate court overruled the insurer's motion for rehearing and affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the beneficiary, including the award for penalty, attorney’s fee, and interest."
"Plaintiff patient, Lisa Molandes, brought a medical malpractice action against defendant doctor, Lance Sloan, M.D., regarding injurious side effects caused by the use of steroids prescribed by Dr. Sloan. Lisa Molandes saw Dr. Sloan in 1993 for gestational diabetes, and he later became her primary physician. Molandes was diagnosed with minimal change disease or focal segmental glumerulosclerosis, for which Dr. Sloan prescribed the steroid drug Prednisone.

Molandes experienced several side effects from taking Prednisone, which she conveyed to Dr. Sloan, but he did not taper the medication. Molandes then sought a second opinion on March 20, 1996, from Dr. Thomas Lowery, who advised immediate tapering. The following day, Molandes was hospitalized with severe abdominal pains diagnosed as acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She was transferred to a Houston hospital and left in a wheelchair with leg braces, having contracted lower extremity neuropathy as a result.

At trial, expert witnesses, including Dr. Peter Howard Jones and Dr. Tom Petty, testified that Dr. Sloan violated the standard of care by continuing steroid therapy and not responding to side effects. The triglyceride elevation caused by the Prednisone was identified as a significant factor leading to Molandes' pancreatitis. Experts also linked the long-term high-dose steroid use to Molandes' injuries, including pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pancreatic pseudocyst, relapsing pancreatitis, and critical illness neuropathy.","The court will affirm the trial court's ruling and judgment in favor of Molandes based on the following reasoning:

The evidence presented at trial, including expert testimony, will support the jury's conclusion that Dr. Sloan's prolonged prescription of steroids was a proximate cause of Molandes' injuries. A reasonable jury could find from this evidence that Molandes' use of steroids for an extended period led to her developing pancreatitis and lower extremity neuropathy, both of which were foreseeable risks. The experts' opinions will establish that it was reasonably medically probable that Dr. Sloan's negligence caused Molandes' injuries, meeting the standard required to establish proximate cause.

The defense might argue that the evidence was insufficient because it did not conclusively show that Dr. Sloan's treatment was the definitive cause of Molandes' injuries, as other possible causes were not ruled out. However, in medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff is not required to prove that the defendant's actions were the only possible cause of injury but rather that the defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injuries, which Molandes' testimony and expert evidence will sufficiently demonstrate.

Furthermore, the other factors that potentially contributed to Molandes' condition, such as hypothyroidism, nephritic syndrome, and medications such as Accutane and Bactrim, will not be proven to be more likely causes of her injuries than the negligence of Dr. Sloan. The weight of the evidence will support the conclusion that Dr. Sloan's prescription of steroids significantly contributed to Molandes' condition.

Given these considerations, the court will determine that Molandes has met her burden of demonstrating that Dr. Sloan's negligence was a substantial factor in her injuries, and as such, the jury's finding and award of damages to Molandes will be upheld. No sanctions for a frivolous appeal will be warranted, as Dr. Sloan's appeal will be deemed not frivolous, despite being unsuccessful."
"The legal case involves Patti J. Wagner, guardian of Jenny Wagner, an incapacitated adult, filing a lawsuit against Four J's Community Living Center, Inc. (""Four J's"") and Anthonia Uduma for injuries sustained by Jenny in a fire at a residential care facility for disabled adults operated by Four J's and Uduma. Jenny, who is legally blind, has cerebral palsy, and profound mental retardation, was severely burned in the incident.

On September 4, 2008, Jenny and two other residents were at the facility; Esperanza Arzola, who also had the mental capacity of a small child, and Tanya James, who later died from injuries sustained in the fire. Jenny, who was wheelchair-bound, could not escape the fire and suffered dire burns. It was alleged that Arzola, who had a history of mental health issues and violent behavior, started the fire using a lighter that the staff had inadequately supervised her access to.

Wagner claimed that Four J's and Uduma breached their duty of care by inadequately supervising Arzola and failing to equip the facility with functional fire prevention systems, as well as not properly training staff for fire emergencies. Wagner contended that it was foreseeable that Arzola could start a fire if she accessed a lighter. Furthermore, the staff member on duty, Udemezue, did not attempt to rescue Jenny when the fire started because there was only one available exit which was near the fire, and she did not have keys to the other doors which were locked.

During the trial, it was revealed that Four J's and Uduma were aware of Arzola's aggressive behavior, mental health diagnosis, suicidal tendencies, and history of violence towards staff. An expert witness testified that the standard of care for residential care providers was breached by allowing Arzola access to a lighter, and by failing to provide adequate supervision, room inspections, staffing, and emergency training.

The jury found Four J's and Uduma negligent and responsible for Jenny's injuries, attributing 60% responsibility to Four J's and 40% to Uduma, and awarded Wagner damages of approximately $8 million. However, the defendants filed a motion for a new trial, disputing the findings and arguing that Arzola's intentional action of starting the fire, which was the cause-in-fact of the injuries, made the finding of their negligence incorrect.

The trial judge agreed and granted the new trial motion. Wagner then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting that an appellate court direct the trial judge to vacate the new-trial order. In response, the appellate court considered whether the trial judge abused their discretion in this grant.","The appellate court will conditionally grant the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by Wagner. It will find that the trial judge abused their discretion in granting a new trial and that Wagner has no adequate appellate remedy. The jury's decision to not find Arzola negligent despite her starting the fire reflects reasonable conclusions about proximate cause, which includes both cause-in-fact and foreseeability. 

The evidence showed that Four J's and Uduma's negligence included their breach of standards of care: providing an incendiary device to Arzola, failing to conduct room inspections, lacking adequate supervision and staffing, not conducting appropriate emergency training, and not supplying keys to all exits, which prevented Jenny's evacuation.

Additionally, the evidence did not necessarily indicate Arzola's actions were negligent per se; the jury could have judged her actions as intentional rather than negligent, and thus determined that Arzola was not the proximate cause of the injuries. It is within the jury's purview to make such determinations of fact, particularly regarding proximate cause, which includes considering foreseeability and other factors that constitute negligence.

Therefore, the appellate court will determine that the jury's verdict was not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and was not manifestly unjust as it was supported by ample evidence. It will conclude that a new trial would unjustly disregard the original jury verdict and lead to further expense and delay. The court will direct the trial judge to vacate the order for the new trial, and a writ from the appellate court will issue only if the trial judge does not comply."
"The appellant survivors (Stephen Kramer, individually and as a representative of Jennie Kramer's estate, and as next friend of their children, Geoffrey and Lyndsey Kramer) filed a medical malpractice action against the appellee hospital (Lewisville Memorial Hospital) following the death of Jennie Kramer due to cervical cancer. The appellants initially sought recovery under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Texas Survivorship Statute, and later revised their claim, alleging a cause of action for loss of chance of recovery.

In August 1985, Jennie Kramer visited her gynecologist, Dr. Eich, due to unusual discharges and bleeding related to her menstrual cycle. Dr. Eich diagnosed her with a yeast infection and sent a slide of her pap smear to the appellee hospital. Both the Hospital's cytotechnologist Frances Nightingale and supervising pathologist Dr. Richard Burgess examined the slide and found it negative for cancer. After continued health issues and consulting another doctor, Dr. Michael Burgess, who did not perform a pap smear and diagnosed her as normal, Jennie Kramer was finally diagnosed with cervical cancer in February 1986 following a biopsy by Dr. Michael Burgess. She passed away on October 31, 1986, after the disease spread to her lungs despite chemotherapy and radiation treatments administered at another hospital.

The appellants claim that the Hospital's failure to timely diagnose Jennie Kramer's cervical cancer deprived her of the opportunity for a better chance of survival or cure. Expert testimony at trial discussed the five-stage classification system for cervical cancer and its survival rates, with the appellants suggesting Jennie was at Stage 0 or 1 when the missed diagnosis occurred, while the Hospital's experts conceded she might have been as far as Stage IV. There was some contention whether her cancer stage could have been diagnosed earlier, thus affecting her chances of survival.

The trial court refused jury instruction requests aligned with the loss of chance doctrine, which would have allowed juries to consider liability for any reduced chance of survival related to the August 1985 pap smear. The jury found neither Ms. Nightingale nor the Hospital’s conduct as the proximate cause of death. The jury verdict resulted in a take-nothing judgment for the Hospital, which was affirmed by the court of appeals.","The Texas Supreme Court held that the Texas law does not acknowledge an action for the lost chance of survival or cure in medical malpractice actions under the Texas Wrongful Death Act, the Texas Survivorship Statute, or as a separate common law cause of action. The Court took intermediate steps to reach this conclusion by analyzing the language of the Texas Wrongful Death Act, which authorizes recovery only for injuries that cause death and not for injuries that merely cause a lost chance of avoiding death. It does not entertain this as a separate compensable injury and requires actual causation of death. The Court further held that the Survivorship Statute's provision did not create a new cause of action that would accommodate loss of chance doctrine as a part of its common law.

The Court rejected various arguments in support of the loss of chance doctrine, including its alignment with physician duty, its deterrence value, and the fairness of imposing uncertainty on the negligent party. The Court emphasized that the doctrine would lead to significant deviations from traditional sufficiency standards of causation that the legal system relies on to determine truth and assign responsibility. It contended such a doctrine could have unintended and broad implications beyond medical malpractice cases and could impact legal certainty in professions and come into conflict with long-standing causation principles in lost profits for new business cases.

In conclusion, the ruling determined that affirming the traditional standard of causation is essential to the legal system's integrity and the truth-seeking function of the courts. Hence, the judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed, rejecting the appellants' other claims of error regarding the admissibility of certain witness testimonies and the inadequacies in verification of supplemental answers to interrogatories as waived or harmless errors."
"Philip Gregory Byrd retained Bourland, Wall & Wenzel, P.C. (Bourland), to form PGB Air, Inc. (PGB) and to convert Lucy Leasing Co., LLC (Lucy Leasing) to be owned solely by him. In April 2006, he hired Jerry Buckner for a divorce action against his wife, Nancy Ann Simenstad, which in December 2006 was taken over by Phillip Galyen, P.C., d/b/a/ Bailey & Galyen Attorneys at Law (Bailey & Galyen). Simenstad served discovery requests that Byrd failed to comply with. Bailey & Galyen did not properly attend to or file responses to the discovery requests. This led to the court enforcing a discovery order, ordering Byrd to provide the requested information and to appear in court to consider sanctions for noncompliance. The trial court eventually held Byrd in contempt for failing to comply, imposed a fine, and committed him to jail for thirty days. Bailey & Galyen filed an appeal and petition for habeas corpus on behalf of Byrd, both of which were unsuccessful. Over time, PGB and Lucy Leasing were also included in the divorce action.

The appellants (Byrd, Lucy Leasing, and PGB) filed a legal malpractice suit against Bailey & Galyen, alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The trial court granted Appellees' no-evidence motion for summary judgment concerning Byrd's claims for legal malpractice arising from the contempt order, adhering to the sole-proximate-cause bar since Byrd hadn't been exonerated. The appellants appealed the summary judgment.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision to grant the Appellees’ partial summary judgment. It will be determined that the remedial-contempt order issued to enforce the prior discovery order in a divorce action is not equivalent to a criminal conviction. Therefore, the sole-proximate-cause bar, which typically applies to legal malpractice claims in the context of criminal convictions, does not apply to civil remedial-contempt orders. The court will look at the policies underpinning the sole-proximate-cause bar and note that they are not fitting in a civil context due to the impossibility of exoneration in such cases, the lack of criminal defendant protections, and having civil jurisdiction over habeas corpus related to the order.

Additionally, Lucy Leasing and PGB were not parties to the remedial-contempt order and did not engage in the noncompliant activities. As such, they cannot be considered having engaged in any ""illegal acts"" that led to the contempt order and consequently cannot be barred from their claims under the sole-proximate-cause standard. The appellate court will thus conclude that Byrd's negligence claims, as well as the claims of Lucy Leasing and PGB, that arise out of the actions leading to the civil remedial-contempt order are not barred by the sole-proximate-cause bar. The case will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to address these claims."
"The appellees, David Nemon and Suzanne Nemon, filed a wrongful death and survival action for the death of their two-year-old son, Howard Nemon, against the appellants, Montessori Educational Corp. of Texas (doing business as Houston Children's Center), and its officers and employees. On December 19, 1980, Howard was delivered to Houston Children's Center by his parents. During outdoor playtime, he was found unconscious and not breathing by an employee, Jackie Jones, who then summoned Sanford Applebaum, another employee. Applebaum conducted an initial examination, attempted to request an ambulance, and provided mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance arrived. Howard was transported to two different hospitals and later pronounced dead on December 22, 1980, having been brain dead upon initial hospital treatment.

The jury found for the parents, failing to find that Howard was injured on the playground but determining that the day care center's failure to provide proper life-saving aid and instructing its employees on emergency procedures were acts of negligence that proximately caused Howard's death. They also assessed various damages, leading to a trial court judgment awarding the appellees $304,822.53 against the appellants.

On appeal, the appellants contested the jury's findings of negligence and proximate cause, specifically arguing that there was no evidence of this and that they did not owe the duties ascribed to them, nor were they negligent in their actions. They raised points that the common law did not require them to render medical assistance or prepare for medical emergencies before they occurred, that they had no duty to provide CPR or train employees in emergency life-saving techniques, and there was no evidence that their actions or lack of them proximately caused the child's death.

The expert medical testimony of Dr. Jachimcyk explained CPR as a technique and suggested that prompt administration of CPR greatly increases the chances of survival and prevents permanent brain damage.","The court is poised to reverse the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees, parents, and render a take nothing judgment against them. The reasoning behind this decision will likely include an emphasis that appellants had a duty to render reasonable assistance to Howard Nemon once he became imperiled and that by performing first aid and securing transportation to the hospital, they fulfilled this duty. The court is expected to assert that appellants were not required under common law to provide specific medical treatments such as CPR or to foresee and prepare for medical emergencies in advance.

With respect to the necessary evidence of proximate cause, the court will likely point out that there was no substantial medical testimony indicating a reasonable medical probability that CPR or a quicker ambulance response would have saved Howard Nemon's life. Emphasis will be placed on the fact that the expert witness's testimony about CPR was based on a hypothetical child who had been unresponsive for less than three minutes, rather than directly addressing Howard's situation.

The court will argue that there were no findings that appellants' actual provision of aid was unreasonable, which is crucial for establishing negligence in the rendition of aid. The court will find no basis in common law or state statute that would impose a duty upon appellants to train staff in life-saving techniques or to anticipate such emergencies. Possible delays in emergency response or lack of training among employees will likely be deemed insufficient grounds for liability without evidence of proximate cause specifically linked to the child's death.

Therefore, the court will likely reverse the previous judgment due to a lack of evidence on the required duty of care and proximate cause, thus siding with appellants and stating that the appellees take nothing from this claim."
"The background of this case originates from an automobile accident on July 15, 2016, in Randall County, where Appellant Anatonia Flores sustained head injuries. Flores filed a negligence claim against Appellee Jerry Rector, alleging that the accident was proximately caused by Rector's negligence. Rector was driving with his wife along South Loop 335 in Amarillo, Texas, at 70 miles per hour using cruise control, when Flores, stopped at the intersection of South Loop 335 and FM 2530, pulled into the intersection in front of Rector's vehicle, resulting in a collision. Rector did not recall applying brakes due to the swift nature of events. A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper determined that Flores failed to yield right of way at the stop intersection and issued her a citation, which Flores later pleaded guilty to.

Flores' lawsuit claimed that Rector was negligent by failing to keep a proper lookout, to maintain attentiveness, to apply or timely apply brakes, to take evasive action, and for driving at an excessive speed. After Flores filed suit, Rector submitted a hybrid motion for summary judgment, including both traditional and no-evidence grounds, countering that there was no evidence of a duty breach or proximate cause leading to Flores's injuries. The evidence Rector provided in his motion included unsworn declarations from himself, his wife, the responding trooper, the trooper's crash report, a third-party witness voluntary statement, and a certified copy of Flores's citation for failing to yield. In opposing the motion, Flores argued that Rector was possibly impaired by alcohol consumption, which would prevent him from foreseeing traffic risks or taking appropriate evasive action. Supporting her response, Flores included excerpts from Rector's deposition and a recording of a 911 call made on the night of the accident, which was excluded by the trial court. The trial court granted Rector's summary judgment without specifying whether it was for the traditional motion, the no-evidence motion, or both, nor the grounds for granting the motion. Flores contested the decision, leading to this appeal.","Rector's motion for summary judgment was correctly upheld by the trial court because Flores's claims lacked evidence of both a breach of duty by Rector and proximate cause. The facts that a collision occurred and the manner in which it did are not inherently indicative of negligence on Rector's part. Furthermore, Flores failed to present evidence that Rector's consumption of two beers prior to the accident impaired him in any significant way or contributed to the collision. As a result, any attribution of negligence to Rector based on these arguments would be purely speculative. 

Additionally, the summary judgment evidence did not sufficiently establish Rector as the proximate cause of the collision and Flores's injuries. Although Flores presented speculation on the physics of the vehicles' movements during the accident, there was no substantive evidence that Rector could have anticipated Flores's actions or had sufficient time to react to prevent the collision. The summary judgment evidence demonstrated Rector as driving at the posted speed limit, aware of the roadway and surrounding vehicles, fulfilling the standard for a reasonably prudent driver. Thus, no reasonable juror could conclude that Rector was negligent given the available evidence.

Given these considerations, the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Rector is affirmed because there is no evidence beyond a mere suspicion that Rector breached any duty owed to Flores or that said breach was the proximate cause of the collision and resulting injuries. Flores's appeal is overruled, and the original judgment stands."
"The case involves an appeal by a railroad employer against a judgment awarded to the appellees, the family of a deceased employee—an engineer—who died when the train he was operating derailed. The family claimed that the derailment was due to the negligent construction of a drainage culvert or negligent maintenance of the railroad tracks, which included the use of rotted ties as supports. Key facts include:

- The railroad's regulations stated that if an engineer anticipated danger ahead on the track, he should stop the train and examine the track.
- Before the incident, the employee was warned that a bridge looked dangerous.
- A culvert built by the railroad failed to adequately drain heavy rainfall off the tracks.
- At the point of derailment, the ties supporting the track gave way, causing the derailment and the employee's death.
- The jury found in favor of the appellees and awarded judgment, which the employer appealed.
- The appeal brought up whether the heavy rainfall was an act of God and whether the railroad's regulations could render the employee's actions as contributory negligence.
- Other facts pertinent to the appeal included testimony about the condition of the track and ties, the specifics of the employee's income and family support, and the admissibility of certain evidence at trial.","Based upon these facts, the court will affirm the judgment rendered in favor of the appellees. The verdict will explain that the evidence supported the finding of negligent construction of the culvert or negligent maintenance of the track due to rotted ties. It will state that even if the heavy rainfall was considered an act of God, the employer's concurrent negligence still rendered it liable for the employee's death. The verdict will further clarify that the regulations requiring the exercise of the employee’s judgment meant that his actions did not constitute contributory negligence as a matter of law; thus, the issue of contributory negligence was rightly submitted to the jury.

The court will also detail that the railroad regulations did not remove the responsibility of the employer to maintain a safe working environment and that the regulation itself called for the employer's action during heavy storms. Furthermore, the court will explain that the employee did not assume the risk of negligent construction or maintenance as he had the right to assume the employer had complied with its legal duty. Pieces of evidence, such as the rotten ties on the track and the railroad’s own safety rules found on the deceased, bolster the case against the employer.

Additionally, the verdict will likely elaborate on the reasoning for rejecting the employer's objections concerning procedural rulings, such as the sufficiency of evidence, the amount of damages awarded, the qualifications of witnesses, and the admissibility of particular pieces of evidence. The court's deliberation will stress that the employee was not required to foresee the danger that the employer, by its negligent maintenance, should have anticipated and mitigated. Thus, the prediction would be that the judgment in favor of the appellees will stand, with all of the employer's assignments of error being overruled, resulting in the affirmation of the lower court's decision."
"H. T. Edwards, an employee of Kelley-Coppedge, sustained personal injuries on June 12, 1974, when he encountered an electrically charged guy line while operating a ditching machine for a pipeline construction project on property controlled by Shell Oil Company. The guy line had become loose and made contact with high voltage electrical lines. The case was initially directed to a verdict in favor of the defendants, Shell Oil Company and K & S Electric Company (who built the line), by the district court of Yoakum County, Texas. In the subsequent appeal, the plaintiff argued that there were disputed facts regarding the duty of the defendants and the proximate cause of his injuries, which should have been determined by a jury.

Evidence presented in the appeal showed that the guy line was either uninsulated or inadequately insulated, creating a dangerous condition on the property before the plaintiff undertook his work. Witnesses with substantial experience in working with high voltage electrical lines testified that guy line wires running above high voltage lines should have insulators sufficient to prevent them from becoming energized. The plaintiff's and defendants’ witnesses provided conflicting testimony regarding the guy line’s condition and the purpose of insulating such lines. Importantly, the location of the pipeline was determined by Shell, and a Shell representative had informed the supervisor of Kelley-Coppedge that adjustments to the pathway to avoid guy lines were not permissible.

The plaintiff himself, due to memory loss from the electric shock, could not recall the events leading up to the accident. It was established that the guy line entered the ground at an angle and continued at an angle underground, a fact unknown to the plaintiff. Shell and K & S contended that the plaintiff failed to prove the existence and violation of a legal duty, and that the injury arose from the plaintiff’s work activity. However, this contention is opposed by the evidence suggesting that the dangerous condition existed prior to plaintiff’s engagement on the property.","The court, in assessing the evidence and applying the law, will include in its reasoning that the issues of negligence, duty of care, and proximate cause were not appropriately resolved through an instructed verdict and should instead be submitted to a jury. As the facts are sharply disputed, particularly concerning the guy line's insulation and its maintenance, the court will find there is sufficient evidence to establish a legitimate dispute on these issues, substantiating a jury trial.

The court will dismiss the defendants' reliance on cases which assert no duty when no dangerous condition exists on the premises before the invitee's work begins. Instead, the court will draw comparisons with cases such as West Texas Utilities Co. v. Renner, which underscore the duty to maintain safe conditions around dangerous electricity conveyances, particularly when injury or consequences of a general nature could reasonably have been anticipated by the defendants.

On the subject of proximate cause, the court will articulate that both cause in fact and foreseeability are substantiated by the evidence. There is testimony that the presence and proper installation of insulators on the guy line would have prevented the injury sustained, and that the defendants could have foreseen the potential for the guy line to become loose and hazardous. Moreover, the passage of time since the installation by K & S and acceptance by Shell will be considered insufficient to abrogate potential negligence without evidence indicating that the guy line's condition had changed since its installation.

Given the presence of some evidence pointing to negligence by K & S in the construction and by Shell in the maintenance of the guy line, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, the court will conclude that a jury must decide the conflicting factual issues. Therefore, the verdict will include the reversal of the trial court's directed verdicts, consolidation of the severed cases against the two defendants, and remand the case for a new trial. The court will expect the jury to consider all the evidence presented to determine the defendants' responsibility for the plaintiff’s injuries."
"Kassie Renee Byrd, a minor, was involved in a lawn mower accident leading to two separate lawsuits. One suit was in the 199th Judicial District Court of Collin County, Texas (Collin County suit), and the other in the 134th District Court of Dallas County, Texas (Dallas County suit). In the Dallas County suit, Jay Downs was appointed as Kassie's guardian ad litem, but he did not participate in the Collin County suit. Multiple settlements were reached, including a $10,000 settlement with Dr. Smilack ($4,000 apportioned to Kassie), a $45,000 settlement with Humana ($19,000 apportioned to Kassie), and a $250,000 joint settlement with Drs. Rosen and Glidden ($97,038.67 apportioned to Kassie). These settlements were approved following prove-up hearings.

Ten days after reaching the age of majority, Kassie and Stephen and Debbie Byrd (her father and stepmother) arranged for a trust agreement with Katherine Woodruff, her attorney, for Kassie's benefit. The agreement included proceeds from the settlements and an additional $12,500 plus interest from the Collin County suit. However, checks from both Collin and Dallas County suits intended for Kassie were alleged to have been misappropriated by Debbie Byrd.

Kassie filed a lawsuit against Woodruff, her former and current law firms, Downs, and his law firm, alleging negligence in the representation, mishandling of settlement proceeds, establishment of the trust, lack of advisement on the trust's validity, and failure to ensure compliance with Texas Property Code. Downs and Woodruff both moved for summary judgment without challenging Kassie's second amended petition. The district court granted summary judgment for all defendants without specifying the grounds for its ruling. Kassie non-suited some claims, leaving others for appeal.","Based on existing legal precedent and the facts presented, the court is likely to affirm summary judgment for post-judgment claims against Downs regarding the creation and execution of the trust, as well as the disbursement of settlements, since no duty was owed by Downs after the final judgment. Similarly, Woodruff will likely receive affirmation for summary judgment on claims related to the apportionment of proceeds from the Rosen & Glidden settlement based on the final court-approved allocation.

Conversely, the court will likely reverse summary judgment granted to Downs and Woodruff on all other claims since they did not provide conclusive evidence or address these claims in their motions for summary judgment. Specifically, the court will find that Downs breached his fiduciary duties by not providing evidence of prudent action in handling the settlement proceeds, such as failing to request that the Humana proceeds be placed in an interest-bearing account. The court will also conclude that absolute judicial immunity does not protect Downs, as he was not acting as an arm of the court but rather as Kassie’s personal representative.

The court will hold that no attorney-client relationship existed between Kassie and Downs, absolving Downs from claims of attorney malpractice. However, the court will reject the application of estoppel and collateral estoppel since Kassie did not directly challenge the settlements or their reasonableness.

Lastly, the court will determine that Downs and Woodruff are entitled to credits against any damages for amounts already recovered by Kassie from prior settlements to prevent double recovery, with specific amounts credited for the Smilack and Humana settlements."
"Jerry Garcia worked for JBS Construction in 2013 and was contracted to work in Africa on a project for GRC as an employee of JBS, subcontracted to GRC. On February 13, 2013, Jerry was directed to the Victoria Health Department for various vaccinations and received a prescription for Malarone, an anti-malarial medication. He was instructed to take 101 tablets, beginning on March 17 and continuing until completed. After traveling to Equatorial Guinea on March 19, Jerry learned his stay would be longer than 90 days. He completed his Malarone course on June 25, 2013, and upon notifying GRC’s project supervisor Randy Rucker that he would run out before his return, Rucker provided him with an alternative medication, instructions for which were in French. Jerry could not read the instructions but was told the new drug would function like Malarone. This new drug, taken in a different dosage, was later identified as Coartem, which does not prevent malaria but is used to treat it.

After returning to the U.S on July 15, 2013, Jerry developed severe symptoms, including vision problems, which led him to seek medical treatment. His symptoms, except for vision issues, improved upon resuming Malarone on July 17, prescribed by Dr. Bain Cate. However, his vision did not recover, resulting in a diagnosis of ""optic neuritis OS."" After several consultations and tests, Jerry was diagnosed with optic neuropathy and continued to be treated by Dr. Homerstad and Dr. Woon, a neuro-ophthalmologist. Dr. Woon referred Jerry to Dr. Todd Price, an infectious disease specialist, to determine whether his optic neuritis was due to an active tropical disease or malaria.

In February 2014, Jerry filed a lawsuit against GRC for negligence and gross negligence, claiming personal injuries. Susanna Garcia, his wife, claimed loss of society and services and mental anguish. During pre-trial hearings regarding expert witness testimonies, several motions were made, and GRC filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on the basis that the Garcias had no legally competent evidence of medical causation. The trial court granted GRC's motion after sustaining objections to the Garcias's summary judgment evidence, including the exclusion of testimony and affidavits from their expert witnesses, Drs. Woon and Waxman, on grounds that it failed to adhere to procedural and evidentiary standards, including business records predicate, the reliability and admissibility of expert opinions, and concentration on Rule 702 regarding qualifications to testify on certain matters.","Given the detailed facts from the Background, including the medical treatment records, travel and medication history, Jerry's symptoms, vaccination records, and expert consultation reports and affidavits from qualified professionals, a reasonable person would predict the Trial Court erred by granting GRC's no-evidence motion for summary judgment and improperly excluded evidence. This prediction rests on the idea that Drs. Woon and Waxman, as expert witnesses, are sufficiently qualified to offer reliable opinions on the medical causation of Jerry's optic neuritis. Their expertise in neuro-ophthalmology and infectious tropical diseases, respectively, provides a reliable foundation for their opinions considering they have explained how they have ruled out other probable causes based on Jerry's medical records, laboratory results, clinical presentations, and specialized knowledge within their expertise. In addition, given the use of differential diagnosis—a well-recognized method within the medical community for determining the cause of a patient's ailment—Dr. Woon's process was sound and based on a reasonable medical probability based on the available evidence, making her determination that malaria caused Jerry's optic neuritis admissible.

The exclusion of business records under Tex. R. Evid. 803(6), which considers medical records including diagnoses as admissible without more than a business records affidavit, will be deemed improper. Therefore, Dr. Woon's medical records should not have been excluded since they were accompanied by a proper affidavit. Furthermore, Jerry's affidavit also should not have been entirely excluded as certain background facts and statements of a party opponent are not considered hearsay according to Rule 801(e)(2)(C), (D), and form a permissible basis for his subsequent actions.

Considering the above, the judgment in favor of GRC regarding the lack of evidence of medical causation is likely to be reversed. The appellate court will likely find harmful error in the exclusion of key summary judgment evidence such as the testifying experts’ affidavits, medical records, and consultations, which are pivotal in establishing causation. The case should be remanded for further proceedings to properly consider the causation element with respect to the admitted expert testimonies and evidence. The appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision regarding Roth Construction, Inc., but reverse and remand in part concerning GRC, with instructions that correspond with these predictions."
"Plaintiffs initiated a product liability action, alleging injury from temporomandibular joint (TMJ) implants. The defendants in this case were E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor), and Louisiana State University (LSU). The key factual elements of this case are as follows:

- DuPont sold polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) under the trademark ""Teflon"" to Vitek, a company that used these materials to make medical devices, including the TMJ implant in question. DuPont warned Dr. Charles Homsy, Vitek's founder, that Teflon was not made for medical use and that detailed studies on its long-term suitability for medical applications had not been conducted. Homsy acknowledged this but continued to utilize PTFE in his products.
- Homsy held positions at both Methodist Hospital and Baylor, where he was involved in biomaterials research and teaching. Baylor is separate from Vitek and was not involved in developing, designing, or selling the TMJ implants.
- LSU was implicated because an employee, Dr. Kent, contributed design and development services for the TMJ implant.

The plaintiffs alleged that DuPont had a duty to warn as a raw material supplier, Baylor was negligent in hiring Homsy and failed to warn of the TMJ implant’s dangers, and LSU was liable because of Dr. Kent's involvement. The trial court granted summary judgments in favor of DuPont and Baylor and sustained a special appearance and plea to jurisdiction for LSU, barring the case from being heard further against LSU.","The court affirmed the summary judgments granted to DuPont and Baylor and sustained LSU's plea to jurisdiction, thus preventing the lawsuit against LSU from proceeding in Texas.

The court will find that DuPont had no duty to warn the plaintiffs because it supplied a non-defective, multi-use raw material to Vitek. DuPont’s warnings to Homsy about the use of Teflon for medical purposes and his acknowledgement of these warnings negate any potential duty to warn on DuPont's part. The court will also conclude that there is no evidence that DuPont took part in designing or manufacturing the final TMJ implant product.

Concerning Baylor, the court will determine that Baylor did not owe a duty to supervise Homsy's work at the PRL related to the TMJ implant, nor did it have any involvement with the development or testing of the TMJ implant. Furthermore, Baylor's hiring of Homsy for teaching duties, which are unrelated to the manufacture or design of the implant, cannot be the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries.

LSU's plea to jurisdiction will be sustained on the grounds of comity and Louisiana’s sovereign immunity laws, which mandate that this suit cannot be brought outside Louisiana state courts. The court will recognize Louisiana as a cooperative jurisdiction and find no violation of Texas public policy in applying Louisiana law to grant LSU sovereign immunity.

The decisions will be based upon the court's interpretations of applicable product liability law, concepts of duty and negligence, the acknowledged limitations of the roles played by DuPont and Baylor with respect to the TMJ implant, and jurisdictional considerations with LSU. The court will emphasize that any liability requires a direct connection between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff’s injury. Given the evidence, the plaintiffs' claims do not establish such a connection firmly enough to hold any of the defendants liable."
"In January 1996, Charles Clark was diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure and underwent mitral valve replacement surgery. Over the subsequent two years, Clark experienced complications, including a valvular leak. In May 1998, Dr. Richard Alexander performed emergency surgery on Clark but failed to recover and died on May 14, 1998.

On December 30, 1999, Sharon Clark, as the executrix of Charles Clark's estate, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against nine healthcare providers, alleging medical negligence. The case focused on three main allegations: the failure to use a ventricular heart-assist device, the untimely performance of surgery to repair the valvular leak, and the non-use of pharmacological agents to lower Clark's pulmonary hypertension.

Sharon Clark designated Dr. James Bass, Jr., a thoracic surgeon, and Dr. Jean-Bernard Durand, a cardiologist, as expert witnesses to testify on liability and causation. However, the defendants challenged the qualifications of both experts. Dr. Bass had relinquished his privileges to perform cardiac surgery in 1991 due to insufficient surgical experience and had never performed a ""re-do"" mitral valve replacement or repair surgery, similar to the one in question. Dr. Durand was not a surgeon and testified that he would not be qualified to offer opinions about cardiovascular surgery. He also stated he would not opine about the standard of care for a cardiovascular surgeon or criticize the surgery.

During the expert witnesses' challenges, the court conducted a hearing and considered the witnesses’ qualifications under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 and the repealed Medical Liability Act, section 14.01, which outlined the qualifications needed for expert witnesses in health care liability claims. As a result, the trial court excluded the expert testimonies related to the surgery day decisions, including the use of assist devices, the pharmacological strategies for lowering pulmonary hypertension, and the timing of Clark's surgery. Following the exclusion of the expert testimony, the trial court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment, leading the plaintiff to appeal the decision.","The judgment will be affirmed because the appellant will be unable to meet her burden of proof regarding the two essential elements of breach of standard of care and proximate cause. Since expert testimony is crucial in establishing these elements in a medical malpractice case, and the appellant's designated experts, Drs. Bass and Durand, were found not qualified to testify on the standards of care and proximate cause relevant to the allegations, there will be no admissible expert testimony to support the appellant's claims.

The trial court's rulings to exclude the testimonies were made with reference to guiding rules and principles of Texas Rule of Evidence 702, the Medical Liability Act, and related case law. The expert witnesses will be ruled as lacking sufficient experience, training, or knowledge of the specific medical procedures and conditions at issue in the claim, and any opinion testimony they offered did not have a reliable scientific or medical foundation.

Additionally, the testimonies on crucial issues such as the use of a ventricular heart-assist device, pharmacological treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and the timeliness of Clark's surgery will be considered either irrelevant or not based on sufficient expertise. As expert testimony on these issues is necessary for the plaintiff's burden, and since the appellant failed to present qualified experts capable of providing legally sufficient evidence on these points, the appellees will prevail on their no-evidence summary judgment motions.

Therefore, the appellate court will overrule the appellant's points of error and uphold the trial court's granting of the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff failed to present evidence with respect to elements essential to her claim which would necessitate reversal of the lower court's decision."
"Plaintiff Myrtle Thomas and her husband filed a personal injury lawsuit against Cowden Cab Company (the defendant) due to injuries Myrtle sustained while being a passenger in one of the defendant's taxicabs. The incident occurred when the taxicab collided with a concrete abutment. A jury trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury awarded damages for past mental pain and suffering, hospital and medical expenses, and loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity in both the past and future due to the injury from the collision, amounting to a total of $2,257.85 after a remittitur. The defendant filed an appeal on several points, including the trial court allowing a trial amendment and the denial of their motion for a mistrial to investigate the plaintiff's testimony regarding not filing income tax returns, which the defendant claimed had only a collateral relationship to the loss of earnings caused by the injuries.

The trial court disregarded the jury's initial finding that the defendant's failure to maintain a proper lookout was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages, subsequently determining that it was indeed a proximate cause. The evidence for this decision was already brought out during the defendant's cross-examination and further elaborated on by the plaintiff without objection. Additionally, the trial court did not err in refusing to submit special issues regarding whether the collision was due to an unavoidable accident or a sudden emergency, as these were not supported by the evidence.

The court examined the definition of ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" provided to the jury within the charge, as well as evidence supporting the special issue of the plaintiff's future loss of earning capacity. It also considered whether the special issues that were not submitted regarding the collision being an unavoidable accident or the result of a sudden emergency were justified.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of Myrtle Thomas and her husband. The court will concur with the trial court's decision to permit a trial amendment because the evidence in question had already been elicited during the trial without objection, rendering the amendment unnecessary. The appellate court will also uphold the trial court's rejection of the defendant's motion for a mistrial and a continuance, agreeing that the plaintiff's statement about not filing income tax returns was indeed tangential regarding the part about her loss of earnings due to injuries from the collision.

Further, the appellate court will agree with the trial court's decision to overlook the jury's answer to Special Issue No. 3, finding defendant's failure to keep a proper lookout for the abutment was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. There will be support for the jury's findings regarding future loss of earning capacity, with a conclusion that the evidence underpins this determination.

The appellate court will also determine that the trial court did not err in refusing to submit the special issues regarding an unavoidable accident or sudden emergency since neither was raised by the evidence. Likewise, the challenge to the jury charge's definition of ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" will not be merited because the objection does not pertain to the part of the charge related to the assessment of damages. All points of error brought up by the defendant will be subsequently overruled, resulting in the affirmation of the trial court's judgment."
"Albert Behne and his wife initiated a legal battle against the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, seeking reparations for the death of Ed Behne, their son. Ed tragically perished in a flood when he, along with two of his brothers and an uncle, were swept away by a collapsing tree that had been struck by a railway bridge dislodged by flood waters. The railway bridge in question had been unable to withstand the force of the flood because of the company's failure to provide appropriate drainage systems within their roadbed and tracks, a requirement proscribed by Texas law under statute R. S. art. 6495. This particular case was initially decided in favor of the Behnes by both the original trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals on the principle that the company's infraction should see them liable for any ensuing injury that might have stemmed from that statutory violation. During the litigation process, substantial evidence was presented. The accident scene was described with the following geographical features: Elm Creek marked by a 4,000-foot-wide valley intersected by the railway that ran north-south, with solid embankments on either side of approximately 2,132 feet and 846 feet respectively, and a 154-foot bridge over the creek itself. The embankments had been previously breached by floods, but not the bridge until the incident in question. The place where the Behne party was fishing was accustomed to campers and fishers, with a public road traversing it, and it was recognized for its susceptibility to sudden floods. The court emphasized the statute was for the protection of individuals as well as property and non-compliance constituted a legal transgression which imposed legal responsibility for any damages directly traceable to such act or omission. However, a significant legal point of deliberation was whether the railway company's failure to adhere to the drainage statute was the direct or proximate cause of Ed Behne's death, with considerations of whether injury from such negligence was reasonably foreseeable.","In determining whether the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company's lack of adequate drainage was the proximate cause of Ed Behne's drowning, the court will consider that proximate cause in law requires the injury to be a foreseeable consequence of the wrongful act. The court will articulate that foreseeability is a central tenet in proximate cause and applies whether the wrongful act is a violation of a statute or a failure to meet common-law obligations. The court will underscore that foreseeability is not based on the actual anticipation of specific harm but on the reasonable anticipation that the wrongful act might result in harm. Therefore, the court will articulate its disagreement with the Court of Civil Appeals, which had previously held that violation of the statute automatically induced liability irrespective of foreseeability. Instead, the court will reiterate that civil liability is confined to injuries that are deemed to be a direct result of the wrongful conduct. By this reasoning, the court will argue that the flood that washed away the bridge, while potentially a consequence of the company's failure to provide necessary drainage, was an unusual and unforeseeable event, and so were the circumstances that led to the plaintiffs being in harm's way. The railway company's statutory violation was not within the reasonable sphere of anticipation, as nobody would typically be found in the vicinity during such a catastrophic flood. Therefore, court will conclude that the proximate cause doctrine dictates that despite the company's statutory violation contributing to the bridge collapse, the injury to Ed Behne was too remote to hold the company liable because it was a highly improbable occurrence that reasonably could not have been foreseen by the company. With this elaborate application of legal principles and consistent precedents, the court will reverse the lower court and appellate decisions, and render a judgment in favor of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company."
"Appellee Vickie Milner, a diabetic, was admitted to Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center for a left-foot infection, and she alleged that the negligence of appellants Anand Balasubramanian, M.D., Doan K. Nguyen, M.D., and the nursing staff of New Medical Horizons, II, LTD D/B/A Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center led to a gangrenous condition, resulting in the amputation of her great toe followed by a protracted recovery. The appellants moved to dismiss Milner's healthcare liability claims, claiming that her expert's report was inadequate. In the interlocutory appeal, the appellants contested the adequacy of the expert report by Marc E. Mitchell, M.D., regarding qualifications, standard of care, breach of care, and causation.

Dr. Balasubramanian, an internal medicine physician, treated Milner and ordered an infectious disease consultation and a surgical consultation with Dr. Nguyen, an orthopedic surgeon, who recommended surgery to remove a foreign body and debride Milner's foot. Surgery was performed, but there was allegedly little follow-up or documented wound care. Five days post-surgery, Milner was discovered to have a gangrenous diabetic left-foot infection and underwent a vascular consult. Subsequently, she needed an amputation of her great toe and further procedures due to critical limb ischemia.

Milner's filed a lawsuit within the timeframe required by the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and Dr. Mitchell provided an expert report which the defendants contended failed to meet the requirements of a fair summary of the standard of care, breach, and causation. The trial court denied the motions to dismiss by the appellants, leading to this appeal.","The court will likely affirm the trial court's orders, finding that Dr. Mitchell's expert report did not constitute an abuse of discretion and met the legal requirements for an expert report under Section 74.351 of the Texas Medical Liability Act (TMLA). Dr. Mitchell was qualified because his experience and practice involved caring for patients with conditions similar to Milner’s, and the connection between vascular surgery and internal medicine in cases involving diabetic foot wounds is sufficiently close to establish relevance.

Dr. Mitchell's report will be considered satisfactory as it provided a fair summary of the standards of care pertinent to Dr. Balasubramanian, Dr. Nguyen, and the nursing staff, outlined specific actions they should have undertaken, detailed the alleged breaches, and articulated the causal chain linking the alleged negligence to the harm that befell Milner. The report will be deemed to have met the statutory requirements by informing the defendants of the particular medical acts under scrutiny and providing the basis for a conclusion that the claims had merit. The argument by Dr. Balasubramanian and Dr. Nguyen challenging the connecting link between the breach and injury will be rejected as premature, with further factual examination reserved for later stages of litigation.

Furthermore, the report’s adequacy will not be judged on its ability to exclude all possible causes of Milner’s injuries, but rather on its demonstration of a “good-faith effort to explain, factually,” the causative connection expected to be proven. Any additional detail that the appellants challenge as missing from the report will be considered beyond the scope of requirement at this pre-discovery stage. Thus, the report of Dr. Mitchell will be deemed to have advanced an objective and legitimate effort to establish a “straightforward link” between the appellants' actions and the patient’s damages."
"The case involves a dispute over a workers' compensation claim following the death of Lawrence Schrieber, an employee of Joe Weaver & Son. Schrieber died after falling from a scaffold and hitting his head while working at a shipbuilding and repairing business in Orange, Texas. His widow, Martha Schrieber, and their two minor children, Willie Mack Schrieber and Lawrence Schrieber Jr., filed a claim with the Industrial Accident Board of Texas for compensation. The Board denied the claim, leading the family to sue to set aside the Board's decision and recover compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

The insurer, Millers' Indemnity Underwriters (appellant), denied liability under the policy, contending that Schrieber's death wasn't due to the fall but was caused by cerebrospinal syphilis, a disease they claimed was the sole cause of his death. The insurer basis its argument on testimony from several physicians who treated Schrieber, stating that his death was a result of the progression of syphilis to its terminal stage, rather than the injury from the fall.

The case was tried with a jury in the District Court, which issued a verdict in favor of the widow and children (appellees), awarding a total of $4,536 in compensation, to be divided equally among them. The insurer appealed the decision, contesting the verdict on the grounds that it was unsupported by evidence, that answers to special issues by the jury were inconsistent, that parts of the trial court's charge were improper, the verdict was excessive, and the compensation was not properly apportioned between the widow and children.

The evidence presented in favor of the Schrieber family included testimony about Lawrence Schrieber's robust health prior to the incident, the lack of visible symptoms of advanced syphilis, and expert opinions from physicians that the fall, rather than syphilis, caused his death. There were also questions about whether syphilis even existed in Schrieber at the time of his fall, while the family provided counter evidence that suggested the injuries from his fall were indeed severe and ultimately led to his death.","Given the detailed presentation of the evidence and careful consideration, the court is expected to hold that the insurer's contention that Schrieber's death was conclusively caused by syphilis is not persuasive. The court will likely find that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the death was a result of the fall from the scaffold.

Furthermore, the court will address the insurer's argument about inconsistencies in the jury's answers by acknowledging that while certain responses appear conflicting, they are not materially so, as to invalidate the judgment. The answers, viewed as a whole, still sustain the claim for compensation, as they support the central fact that Schrieber was injured in the fall, and the fall contributed to his death.

The insurer's claim that the court's instructions were a charge upon the weight of evidence will likely be overruled by considering that the instructions, when viewed in the context of the specific issues presented to the jury, did not probably cause an improper verdict.

Despite the verdict being found as excessive due to miscalculation of compensation, the court sees no indication of improper motive by the jury, and instead of reversing the judgment, the court will reform the award to the correct sum dictated by evidence.

Lastly, the court will address the incorrect apportionment of compensation between the widow and children, agreeing with the appellant that the law of descent and distribution was not followed. The court will therefore reform the judgment to allocate the compensation as is legally required, with half going to the widow and one-quarter to each child, acknowledging precedent such as the Texas Employers' Insurance Association v. Boudreaux case.

After considering all of these factors and overruling other points raised by the appellant, the court will reform the judgment in favor of the widow and children to the corrected amounts and ratios, affirming it as so reformed. Costs of the appeal will be adjudged against the appellees."
"The appellant, an injured party, sought review after a previous judgment from the 11th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, was not in his favor regarding his personal injury claim against the appellee cab company. The appellant had sustained injuries when an employee of the appellee cab company shot him following a traffic altercation. The crux of the appellant's argument centered around the claim that the appellee was liable for the negligence of its employee who was carrying a weapon during the altercation. The appellant contended that, due to the appellee's policies and regulatory control over drivers, the company should've been aware or should have reasonably foreseen that its employees could carry weapons, thus contributing to a dangerous environment. 

Specifically, the company did not forbid drivers from carrying guns nor inform them about procedures during traffic incidents. Evidence from the trial highlighted that cab drivers commonly carry guns, and there was at least one prior instance where a cab driver killed a man following a traffic incident. Additionally, a police officer testified to the commonality of armed cab drivers in Houston; the company's claims manager found a gun in a cab previously; and the president had admitted to a conscious decision not to ask its drivers about carrying guns. This was against a backdrop of frequent traffic accidents in Houston, which sometimes escalated to assaults and even murder, increasing the risk of shootings when drivers were armed. The trial acknowledged the negligence of the cab company, the driver (McIntyre), and the appellant, with the jury assigning causation percentages of sixteen percent, forty-two percent, and forty-two percent respectively to each, and damages of $3,077,500.00 to the appellant.

However, the trial court disregarded the jury's findings regarding the operation of the cab during the shooting and ruled as a matter of law that the cab company's negligence could not be a proximate cause of the appellant's injuries due to the shooting being an intentional act. This take-nothing judgment dismissed the appellant's claims against the cab company while allowing for recovery from the individual, McIntyre. The appellant's appeal challenged this ruling, particularly that the city code section 46-17 implying vicarious liability was misinterpreted, and that the appellee's negligence should be recognized as a proximate cause of his injuries.","The court will find that the evidence presented does indicate negligence on the part of the appellee cab company and that this negligence was a proximate cause of the appellant's injuries, contrary to the trial court's decision to grant a take-nothing judgment. The evidence will likely lead to a reversal of the trial court's judgment because it showcases a duty of care owed by the cab company that was breached due to foreseeable risk.

The court will determine that the appellant has established components of negligence: the appellee owed a duty, breached said duty, and as a result, damages were proximately caused to the appellant. It will be reasoned that the foreseeable risk of injury was high due to the company's failure to address the potential danger of its drivers carrying guns, combined with the commonality of violent outcomes stemming from traffic incidents. The frequency of aggressive encounters involving cab drivers and the knowledge that some drivers carried weapons will solidify the foreseeability factor of the risk, thus satisfying the duty component of negligence.

The verdict will likely articulate that the intentional nature of McIntyre’s act (the shooting) does not relieve the cab company of responsibility for creating a situation in which such an act could foreseeably occur. Evidence of prior similar incidents will reinforce the claim that the negligent act—a refusal to regulate or address the carrying of guns by drivers—was a substantial factor in precipitating the appellant’s injuries. 

In conclusion, the court will predict that such evidence supports findings of negligence and proximate cause and that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's answers. The court will likely order a reversal of the take-nothing judgment and render judgment in favor of the appellant, awarding him recovery from the appellee commensurate with the degree to which the appellee's negligence contributed to his injury. This reasoning will rest on the evidence and applicable law supporting a finding that the cab company negligently facilitated a foreseeable danger which led to the appellant's injuries."
"On March 23, 1983, Rosita Hernandez Rodriguez drove her automobile over and critically injured a small child. Harold Snellenberger, a police officer employed by the City of Pecos, was notified of the accident and proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, a fellow officer administered CPR to the child, while officer Snellenberger moved back the crowd that had gathered, including the mother of the injured child. While controlling the crowd, officer Snellenberger suddenly collapsed and later died of a heart attack. The widow and children of Snellenberger brought a wrongful death action against Rodriguez, relying on the rescue doctrine.

The rescue doctrine traditionally supports individuals who engage in rescue activities for others in imminent peril, providing a form of legal protection for their heroic acts. This doctrine came into existence prior to the adoption of comparative negligence as a means to alleviate the harsh consequences of contributory negligence. The decedent’s heirs filed suit under this doctrine.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Rodriguez, and the heirs' appeal to the civil court of appeals was unsuccessful, as the appeals court upheld the summary judgment. The appeals court determined that the rescue doctrine was not applicable because there was no perilous situation inviting rescue. Additionally, the court found that the decedent's heart attack was not a foreseeable result of Rodriguez's negligence, thus not satisfying the requirement of foreseeability which is integral to a negligence cause of action.

The case references the elemental requirement of proximate cause in negligence actions, which consists of both cause in fact and foreseeability. Both elements must be established for the defendant to be held liable. Foreseeability implies that the defendant should have anticipated the dangers created by their negligent act. This principle was reinforced in a cited previous case (Freeman v. City of Pasadena) where it was determined that emotional harm to a step-father who was not present at the scene of an accident was not foreseeable as a matter of law.

A dissenting opinion was delivered by Justice Robertson (joined by Justices Ray and Mauzy), who disagreed with the majority's reading of the rescue doctrine and the handling of the foreseeability issue. The dissenting opinion argued that the intervention of a rescuer is considered a foreseeable response to a defendant's creation of a dangerous situation as per the rescue doctrine’s policy. The majority opinion was also criticized for excluding any real application of the rescue doctrine and for wrongly refocusing the case on foreseeability. The dissent called for a remand for a trial on the merits, asserting that there existed a genuine issue of material fact regarding the element of peril that should have precluded the granting of summary judgment.","The court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of Rosita Hernandez Rodriguez. In their reasoning, they will state that the rescue doctrine does not apply in this case because the heart attack suffered by Officer Snellenberger was not a foreseeable consequence of Rodriguez's negligence. The prediction of the court's decision is based on the established requirement that for a negligence action, both cause in fact and foreseeability must be present. The court will state that the chain of causation was broken by the unforeseeable nature of the heart attack, which as a matter of law, could not have been anticipated by Rodriguez in the light of the circumstances surrounding the traffic accident.

The verdict will also draw upon precedents, like Freeman v. City of Pasadena, to reinforce the point that foreseeability is a legal threshold that must be satisfied for liability to attach in negligence cases. Officer Snellenberger's heart attack, the court will determine, was not the natural and probable result of Rodriguez's negligent act of injuring a child with her automobile. The court will reiterate that foreseeability requires an actor to have reasonably anticipated the dangers posed to others by their actions and, in this case, the specific medical outcome of Officer Snellenberger's heart attack did not meet this standard.

Due to these reasons, the court will conclude that Rodriguez cannot be held liable for the wrongful death under the principle of the rescue doctrine, and the summary judgment ruling against the petitioners (the heirs of Officer Snellenberger) will stand."
"The plaintiff, Daniel R. Songer, an apprentice electrician, sustained injuries while repairing an electrical installation for the defendant, Shell Oil Company, and was subsequently awarded damages by the 164th District Court of Harris County, Texas. Shell Oil was engaged in a joint water flood project in West Texas around Denver City and did not employ electricians themselves but relied on independent contractors for the construction and maintenance of the necessary lines and electrical installations. The plaintiff’s employer, Arther Electric, Inc., was responsible for repairing the system following the damages caused by an electrical storm. 

On the day of the accident, the plaintiff was tasked with making permanent repairs to a transformer bank that had been temporarily fixed by Arther, the president of Arther Electric. Arther de-energized the installation and explained the repair process to Songer, cautioning him to be careful around the transformer bank. After attempting to attach line clamps from the ground using a non-conducting hot-stick, the plaintiff was unable to tighten one and re-ascended the aluminum ladder, where he received an electric shock and fell, leading to injuries that required the amputation of his right leg.

During the subsequent trial, the jury found that Shell's failure to deactivate the high voltage lines was a form of negligence contributing to the accident, assigning 50% of the negligence causing the occurrence to Songer. Shell contended that it owed no duty to Songer to de-activate the power line. The case focused on whether Shell, who operated the high voltage electrical distribution system like a utility, had the responsibility to ensure the safety of the contractor's employees by deactivating the lines where work was being performed, as outlined in the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC).

Expert testimonies were provided, detailing the responsibilities of a utility under the NESC and standard safety practices in the industry. Evidence regarding the definition of a 'utility,' Shell’s role in the water flood project, and management of electricity distribution was examined. The relationship between Shell and the National Electrical Safety Code, as well as their adherence to industry safety standards, was highlighted, alongside the respective duties of the owner of the premises and contractors employed on it.","The court would reverse the damages awarded to the plaintiff and rule that he take nothing from Shell Oil Company due to insufficient evidence to establish a duty on Shell's part to deactivate the electrical lines. It will be determined that no duty is owed by Shell because the inherent dangers of working around live wires were known to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's employer, Arther Electric, had the responsibility to perform work safely. The employer was in a superior position to eliminate any dangers and to furnish the necessary equipment for the safe completion of the work.

The court would assert that it was not Shell's responsibility to anticipate the contractor's work methods, to ensure the contractor provided safety measures for its employees, or to supervise the contractor's compliance with safety precautions. The evidence would not support the imposition of a duty on Shell beyond that of an owner of premises and that there is no evidence that working on an electrical installation posed an unreasonable risk to the employees of an independent contractor like Arther Electric.

Furthermore, the court will likely argue the plaintiff's employer was aware of the location of the work and could have requested deactivation of lines before commencing work. Since the dangerous condition arose from the work activity of the plaintiff and his employer, it would be concluded that Shell had no duty to protect them from hazards inherent in the work they were hired to perform. Therefore, the court will render judgment for Shell Oil Company, concluding the plaintiff Daniel R. Songer should take nothing due to the absence of proof establishing a duty of care owed by Shell in the circumstances of the case."
"The appellant, the family of the deceased patient Brett Gentry, initiated a wrongful death and survival action against Wise Regional Health Systems (formerly known as Decatur Community Hospital) and several nurses, claiming negligence and gross negligence in the diagnosis and treatment of Gentry, which they alleged resulted in her death. Gentry, a 16-year-old girl, initially saw her primary care doctor on December 17, 2002, for symptoms like high temperature, cough, congestion, and chest pain. Two days later, she visited the Decatur Community Hospital emergency room due to exacerbated symptoms, including coughing, cramping, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness. During her time in the hospital, Gentry also experienced difficulty breathing, chest pain, episodes of low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Two days after admission, while being moved to the ICU, she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated.

The appellants (the hospital and the nurses) filed a plea to the jurisdiction claiming sovereign immunity, arguing that the family's allegations did not constitute a waiver of such immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act because they did not involve the condition or use of tangible personal property causing Gentry's death. Three expert witnesses were retained by the family, and depositions were provided. The family's pleadings included allegations that the defendant nurses misused tangible personal property, such as IVs, medications (including Stadol), a pulse oximeter, a blood pressure machine/cuff, an oxygen supply, an oxygen mask, and an ambu bag.","The appellate court was set to uphold the trial court's decision regarding the claims that involved the use of certain medications, acknowledging that the administration of medications by the hospital and nurses could be considered a ""use"" of tangible personal property. The court would consider the facts that were provided, such as the medical testimony suggesting that the medications administered contributed to Gentry's hypoxia and, when combined with her myocarditis, led to a heart arrhythmia which caused her death. Therefore, the appeals court would find that the family's pleadings were sufficient to establish a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the medications. In supporting the trial court's decision, the court would emphasize the family's expert witnesses' testimonies that stated the aforementioned sequence of medical events as well as the duty the nurses had to question the doctor's prescriptions based on Gentry’s condition.

As for the family's claims based on the failures to act and allegations pertaining to the use of other medical equipment like the pulse oximeter, blood pressure machine, and other items, the verdict would have been different. The appellate court would determine that these allegations or any evidence that came forth during the plea to the jurisdiction did not sufficiently establish that these items caused or contributed to Gentry's death. In such claims, the court would reverse the trial court's order and dismiss those for want of subject matter jurisdiction given the absence of a proximate cause relationship between their use and Gentry's death. 

The appellate court would affirm the trial court's order in part, agreeing where there's sufficient evidence to establish a link between the use of certain medications and Gentry's death but reverse and dismiss the other claims where such a link is absent."
"On December 31, 1994, at Arlington Memorial Hospital, Donna Morrell gave birth to her daughter, Madeline, who suffered permanent neurological injuries that were allegedly proximately caused by the negligence of the defendants: Dr. Mary Angeline Finke, Obstetrical & Gynecological Associates of Arlington (the clinic), nurses Rose Fenton R.N.C., Sandy Stephens R.N., and Marianne Walker R.N., and Arlington Memorial Hospital Foundation, Inc. (the hospital). The parents claimed that Madeline's injuries resulted from complications during labor and delivery due to failure to perform a timely cesarean section and the forceps delivery method used. The jury found that all defendants' negligence was a proximate cause of the child's injuries and awarded damages to the parents, Madeline, and for medical expenses. However, the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) regarding the parents' damages for mental anguish and loss of consortium.","The court modified the judgment from the trial court to delete the imposition of joint liability on Nurse Fenton, as she had been found 5 percent proportionately responsible and under Texas law, such a finding did not permit joint liability. The parents' claim for their child's medical expenses belonged solely to them and had a two-year statute of limitations under Texas law. Thus, the claims against the nurses were time-barred, and the judgment on that ground should have been granted by the trial court. The evidence presented was sufficient to support the finding that Dr. Finke's negligence, in not performing a cesarean section when the baby's distress signs during labor were evident, was a proximate cause of the permanent injuries to the child. Similarly, the nurses' breaches of duty were substantial influencing factors that, had they not occurred, would have likely prevented the injuries sustained by Madeline. As for damages awarded for past and future medical expenses, based on the testimony provided and the documentation of past treatments, the amounts granted by the jury were factually supported and did not require any adjustment or remittitur. Hence, the court affirmed the rest of the judgment, including the JNOV concerning the parents' claims for mental anguish and loss of consortium, but reversed the imposition of liability on all nurses for the child's past medical expenses, rendering judgment that the parents take nothing from the nurses on that claim."
"E. E. Cotten, the appellee, initiated a legal action against Southland-Greyhound Lines, Inc., the appellant, seeking damages for the personal injuries his wife suffered and for damages to his automobile, resulting from a collision between one of the company's buses and Cotten’s Ford coupe. The incident took place on the Beaumont-Orange Highway in Texas on the evening of November 9, 1929. Cotten, his wife, and their ten-year-old daughter were driving from Beaumont to Orange when they encountered a parked truck and a parked Chevrolet car on the road as they approached a bridge. Due to oncoming traffic, Cotten had to stop his car behind the Chevrolet, and shortly afterward, the bus driven by an employee of Southland-Greyhound hit the rear of Cotten’s car.

At trial, Cotten presented evidence, including testimony from a bus passenger, that prior to the collision, the bus had been following Cotten’s car closely for several miles. The bus passenger testified that the bus driver had difficulty stopping the bus and even stated, ""I am bound to hit them,"" before the collision. The passenger also examined the bus’s brakes after the accident, finding them to have little to no resistance, indicating they were defective. Additionally, the bus driver himself testified that if he had seen Cotten's car stopping 50 or 75 yards away, he would have had time to stop the bus, confirming he was not blinded by any lights at the distance and had a clear view when Cotten’s car stopped.

Cotten’s wife was severely injured in the accident, became an invalid, and required constant nursing care. She suffered significant weight loss and paralysis in her right leg, along with constant pain and suffering. The bus company challenged both the factual findings of negligence specifically regarding the brakes and the measures of damages awarded for Cotten's wife's care and loss of service, as well as the market value of the car before the accident.

During the trial, multiple issues regarding jury instructions, definitions of proximate cause, considerations of potential contributory negligence, and various other matter were contested. The appellant also argued that the damages awarded were excessive and not properly supported by the evidence.","The Texas court affirmed the judgment in favor of the appellee, Cotten. The court found that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the bus's brakes were defective, which is a crucial factor in the chain of events leading to the collision. The court concluded that the defective brakes were a major factor in causing the collision and the appellant company could not prove that any other element, such as the actions of other drivers, the lighting of Cotten’s car, or potential parking violations by the truck and the Chevrolet, was the sole proximate cause of the accident.

Moreover, the jury's instructions regarding proximate cause were deemed proper by the appellate court, and it was judged that the jury was adequately enabled to determine that the defective brakes, along with excessive speed and a failure to maintain a proper lookout, were the proximate causes of the collision, without being unnaturally influenced by improper instructions or definitions provided during the trial.

Concerning the issue of damages, the appellate court found that the testimony and evidence given at trial about the care required for Cotten's wife by the nurses, the past and future medical expenses, and the impact on Cotten's saving capacity, adequately supported the jury’s damages award. Additionally, the jury’s assessment of the damages for the personal injuries to Cotten’s wife was not seen as excessive given the severe and permanent nature of her injuries, her loss of well-being, and the financial impact on the family. The court acknowledged that appellee's wife was in good health before the accident, and her present condition was a direct consequence of the collision. 

The court discounted the contention that there might have been other pre-existing conditions contributing to her health issues after hearing the medical testimonies which established a clear connection between the collision and her current health state, rejecting the possibility that the paralysis could have been due to historical health issues.

The appellate court indicated that the jury was within its rights to make such monetary awards based on the testimony regarding the nurse's regular duties, the ongoing medical expenses, and the general knowledge of a wife's service value to a household. The court recognized that life expectancy figures could be judicially noticed without special pleading or proof. Fundamentally, the court maintained that the decision on responsibility and damages rested solidly within the realms of jury discretion given the evidence presented at trial and did not find any compelling reasons to overturn the verdict based on legal or factual error. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed, and Cotten’s award for damages was upheld."
"The case involves an appeal by The National Life and Accident Insurance Company (the appellant insurance company) against Mildred L. Brogdon, the beneficiary of three insurance policies issued on the life of her deceased husband, James Phillip Brogdon. The deceased was 24 years old, healthy, and strong, and he died during a scuffle with a coemployee. The autopsy revealed a metabolic defect, which the pathologist testified would not have led to death without added trauma. The insurance company argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that the death was caused solely by external, violent, and accidental means and that the metabolic defect also resulted from such means. Contradictory to this, the jury found that the bodily injuries sustained by Brogdon caused his death directly and independently of all other causes, and that the metabolic defect was a contributing cause to his death as well as being caused solely by the same external, violent, and accidental means.

At the time of Brogdon's death, he was working as a mechanic. The incident occurred when a coemployee ""goosed"" him in the ribs from behind. Brogdon chased and caught the coemployee, and after a short scuffle, his grip loosened, and he collapsed to the ground and died. Dr. Irvine, the pathologist, considered death to be caused by either a coronary artery spasm or by ventricular fibrillation - both could be linked to a metabolic defect or imbalance, which could have resulted from overexertion or excitement.

The appellant contends there is an irreconcilable conflict between the jury's findings regarding the cause of death and the contribution of the metabolic defect, and that there is no evidence to support a finding that the defect was solely caused by the accident.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of Mildred L. Brogdon, thereby denying the appeal of The National Life and Accident Insurance Company. The verdict will likely be based on the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury's finding that the deceased sustained bodily injuries which were the direct and independent causes of death, resulting solely from external, violent, and accidental means. In additional support of the judgment, the court will consider that a metabolic defect is generally caused by factors such as overeating, overexertion, or excitement. Given that there was no evidence of overeating and that overexertion and excitement were present during the incident, the court will find substantial evidence that the metabolic defect was caused by the accident.

The court will also rely on the case law that holds if an accident accelerates death, it must be treated as the proximate and sole cause, even when a diseased condition might have hastened death. The distinction between proximate and remote causes will be pivotal in determining that the accident was the immediate and predominant cause. Moreover, the court will acknowledge that the deceased's metabolic defect, although contributing to death, was also caused by the accident, as indicated by the jury's finding. This deems the defect not as a preexisting infirmity or disease but as a result of the accident, which under policy terms, does not preclude recovery.

Such a judgment will follow the general legal reasoning that the specific terms and conditions laid out in insurance policies dictate the extent of coverage, and courts tend to rule based on the interpretation of these terms as to whether an injury or death falls within the scope of the policy's protection. The court will likely emphasize the need for a practical understanding of policy language, aligning with the sensible expectations of the parties involved in the contract."
"The case involves a wrongful death action against a county mental hospital and its employees. In July 1988, Roger Bossley, who was suffering from major depression and had previously attempted suicide, was admitted to Hillside Center, owned and operated by Dallas County Mental Health and Mental Retardation (Dallas MHMR). Hillside is an ""open"" facility that normally allows patients significant freedom of movement.

On August 9, Bossley expressed a desire to procure a gun for suicide. This prompted his treating physician, Dr. Urschel, to deem him ""a definite risk to himself."" A transfer back to a more restrictive Mental Diagnostic Center was ordered for further evaluation, given his continued suicidal ideation. Hillside had a practice of locking the front door when transfers were pending to a more restrictive environment. Therefore, following the order for Bossley's transfer, the outer door was locked. However, no suicide or elopement precautions were explicitly ordered, and the inner glass door remained unlocked.

Despite observations and discussions among Dallas MHMR staff about Bossley's fear of being transferred and potential escape risk, he was not constantly monitored. Angela Jones, a Hillside employee aware of Bossley’s restrictions, did not alert others to watch him as she unlocked and opened the outer door to leave for lunch. Concurrently, Bossley overpowered Jones, escaped the facility, and eventually ran across a highway where he was struck and killed by a truck.

A wrongful death action was filed by the decedent's estate against the county mental hospital and employees, alleging negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees based on governmental immunity. Appellants, representatives of the estate, contended that the employees were exercising medical rather than governmental discretion, and that the claims involved the condition of property, specifically the unlocked doors, thereby constituting an exception to governmental immunity.","The court will reverse the trial court's summary judgment grant to appellee Dallas MHMR. The court will hold that governmental immunity does not apply in this instance because the alleged negligent conduct involved a ""condition"" of the property, namely the unlocked doors, rather than nonuse of the property. Additionally, the appellees were found to be employing medical, as opposed to governmental, discretion in their actions, which further validates the exception to governmental immunity.

The court will determine that there is a significant distinction between medical and governmental discretion. The decision-making involved in the care and treatment of Roger Bossley will be determined to be medical discretion. The officials' conduct regarding Bossley's transfer and failure to secure the doors will be construed as involving the use and condition of tangible property, namely the doors of the facility. It will be concluded that Hillside’s failure to ensure the inner door was locked constituted a condition presenting a defect for its intended purpose, making the property itself part of the negligence claim. This will be paralleled with previous case law where the failure to provide protective equipment or adequate resources was deemed a 'condition' or 'use' of tangible property, meaning the government unit could be liable if it were a private individual under the same circumstances.

The court will forecast that appellees failed to conclusively establish that Roger's death could not have been caused by the condition or use of tangible property. Therefore, summary judgment based on governmental immunity will be proscribed. The court will also resolve that appellees did not conclusively prove that they employed governmental discretion to merit official immunity.

For proximate cause, the court will posit that appellants have raised genuine issues of material fact, emphasizing that the risk of Roger's suicide was foreseeable and recognizing the negligence in failing to enforce proper suicide precautions.

Finally, the court will deem the matter of the statutory cap on damages as not ripe for resolution, as it is contingent on a finding of liability which has yet to be established.

In summary, the court will reverse the previous decision and remand the case for further proceedings in line with its reasoning, reflecting legal interpretations regarding the conditions and use of property under the Texas Tort Claims Act and the separation between medical and governmental discretion within the context of official immunity."
"This appeal arises from a subsurface trespass case between Lightning Oil Company and Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC concerning the drilling of wells to access mineral estates. The material facts of the case are as follows:

A. Cutlass Lease: A severed mineral estate exists under a portion of the Briscoe Ranch, where the ownership of oil, gas, and minerals on the land was retained by the previous owner through a reservation in a warranty deed, without expressly including any right to control subterranean structures.

B. Lightning's Lease (2009, amended in 2013): Lightning obtained a lease on the Cutlass Lease mineral estate with rights to explore for and produce hydrocarbons, excluding helium, carbon dioxide, and other commercial gases.

C. Anadarko's Lease and Agreement: Anadarko leased a mineral estate under the adjacent Chaparral Wildlife Management Area (CWMA) and entered into a Surface Use and Subsurface Easement Agreement with Briscoe Ranch. This permitted Anadarko to site drilling rigs on the ranch and drill through the earth beneath it to access wells in the CWMA.

D. Lightning's Suit: Lightning brought a lawsuit against Anadarko to prevent it from siting wells and drilling through the Cutlass Lease area, asserting exclusive drilling rights within the lease boundaries.

E. Anadarko's Actions and Arguments: Anadarko had begun siting wells and planned to drill vertically and then deviate the wellbores to reach its leasehold under the CWMA. Anadarko's argument was that it only required permission from Briscoe Ranch, as the surface estate owner, to site and drill, and that it could not trespass by drilling where Lightning's hydrocarbons may be.

F. Procedural Posture: The legal proceedings involved summary judgment motions by both parties. Lightning sought an injunction to stop Anadarko's drilling, while Anadarko moved for traditional and no evidence summary judgment, claiming justification. Ultimately, the trial court granted Anadarko's motion without stating specific grounds, leading to this appeal by Lightning.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, based on a detailed analysis of the ownership rights associated with surface and mineral estates and the application of legal standards to the summary judgment motions. 

The key conclusions that will inform the ruling are as follows:

1. The surface estate owner (Briscoe Ranch) controls the earth matrix and has the authority to permit activities such as drilling that might penetrate these subsurface structures.

2. The mineral estate owner's rights, as held by Lightning, include exploration and production of oil and gas but do not automatically grant control over the surrounding earth or subterranean structures.

3. Since Anadarko secured Briscoe Ranch's permission to site and drill wells designed to reach the CWMA, it did not commit trespass on Lightning's leased mineral estate. Specifically, there was no evidence presented by Lightning to indicate a legal right to exclude others from drilling through the earth within the leased boundaries.

4. Anadarko's justification for drilling operations is legally sound given the Surface Use and Subsurface Easement Agreement with Briscoe Ranch.

Based on the lease terms, applicable law, and the agreement between Anadarko and Briscoe Ranch, the court will predict that Anadarko had the legal right to conduct the drilling activities disputed by Lightning. Furthermore, Lightning will not have succeeded in showing that Anadarko's actions caused compensable injury or tortious interference. The affirmative defense of justification, as asserted by Anadarko, will be deemed conclusively established, leading to the overall affirmation of the trial court's order in favor of Anadarko."
"Henrietta Flores, the appellant, served as an aide to social workers at the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services for nearly fifteen years. Her primary job was to transport children to various appointments, which involved driving up to twelve hours a day. She was involved in a car accident while on duty, which caused her to suffer back and knee injuries, leading to two surgeries that left her permanently disabled.

Flores was ultimately dismissed from her job due to her inability to perform her duties, and she subsequently applied for occupational disability retirement benefits from the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS), which provides a retirement system for incapacitated state employees. Her application was denied on the basis that her disability did not meet the statutory definition of an occupational disability according to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 811.001(12).

Flores appealed, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) found in her favor, recommending that occupational disability benefits be granted. However, the Board of Trustees for ERS reversed the ALJ's decision and denied the benefits, which was subsequently affirmed by the District Court of Travis County. Flores then appealed the manner of the Board's decision and its interpretation of section 811.001(12).

The Board specifically rejected the ALJ's conclusion that the accident was a hazard peculiar to Flores's job and that her preexisting conditions did not preclude compensation. The ALJ had found that the injury directly resulted from a risk inherent in Flores's state employment and that her disability was not solely caused by the incident without regard to preexisting conditions. Despite Flores contending that the Board arbitrarily applied a new policy without notice, the Board and the trial court disagreed, which led to the current appeal.","The appellate court will predict that the judgment of the trial court and order of the Board will be reversed. It will determine that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously due to several reasons: its prior decisions were not respected, there was a failure to comply with statutory authorizations and administrative rules, a lack of due process was apparent in the Board's decision-making procedure, and it changed findings and conclusions for unauthorized and unexplained reasons without adequate record support.

Furthermore, the appellate court will find that the Board's interpretation of section 811.001(12) was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. The court will conclude that the legislature intended for the term ""occupational disability"" to mean that an employee’s disability must primarily be caused by an injury arising from their state employment, and that a preexisting condition that becomes symptomatic only due to the injury should not prevent the awarding of benefits. The court will determine that ""risk or hazard peculiar to a duty"" encompasses increased risks inherent to job duties that are distinct from risks encountered by the general public. As Flores's duty as an aide significantly increased her risk of an accident, which ultimately led to her injury, her disability will be considered as resulting from a risk peculiar to her employment.

Thus, the court will reverse the lower court and Board decisions and remand the case back to the Board with instructions to proceed in a manner consistent with their newly established interpretation of the statute."
"On February 8, 1972, James E. Saunders suffered a serious back injury after slipping in mud at his workplace. He underwent a lumbar laminectomy and later received treatment for thrombophlebitis of the left leg. Despite the medical interventions, Saunders was unable to return to work due to intense pain, for which his doctors prescribed several painkillers, including Valium, Darvon N, Phenaphen #3, and Soma. Over time, Saunders' condition deteriorated; he became more withdrawn and increasingly relied on his prescribed medication, consuming multiple pills at a time. On September 24, 1972, after being observed taking his medication, Saunders died from a self-inflicted shotgun wound while his family was away at church.

Medical expert Dr. Doak testified about the impact of Saunders' medications and his consequent mental state. Dr. Doak stated that the combination of Saunders' medications, pain, and disability likely led to a profound emotional depression. He noted that the medications could seriously impair judgment, induce a state of mind to perform actions otherwise unlikely to be undertaken, and possibly lead Saunders to commit suicide.

Following the denial of compensation by the Industrial Accident Board, Saunders' spouse filed a lawsuit seeking death benefits. The jury concluded that Saunders' work-related injury and subsequent medical treatment had caused such derangement that he committed suicide due to an uncontrollable impulse, and without a willful or voluntary intent to harm himself.","The court will reverse the trial court's judgment that awarded death benefits to Saunders' spouse. The court reasons that, although there is evidence suggesting Saunders' injury and medical treatment were a contributing cause to his suicide, the evidence does not satisfy the legal standard set by the case Jones v. Traders & General Ins. Co. For the beneficiaries to recover death benefits due to suicide under this rule, it needs to be shown that the decedent took their own life as a result of an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy without conscious volition. The court finds that the testimony of Saunders' behavior and the expert medical opinion provided by Dr. Doak do not conclusively demonstrate an uncontrollable impulse or a delirium of frenzy that lacks conscious volition; rather, they suggest the suicide was a result of a loss of judgment or an irrational impulse akin to an intoxicated act.

It is determined that the decedent's act of suicide, although related to the distortion of values and impairment of judgment caused by the medications and his condition, still involved conscious action. Therefore, despite the fact that Saunders' medicated state and emotional turmoil influenced his decision, it cannot be categorically stated that he acted without any conscious volition or in a state of frenzy that would legally disconnect the chain of causation required for death benefits under workers' compensation law.

The Texas Workers' Compensation Act does not permit recovery of death benefits for a suicide that is the result of a voluntary and willful act, even if influenced by a disordered state of mind attributable to a work-related injury and subsequent treatment. As such, the absence of concrete evidence for an uncontrollable impulse or delirium of frenzy without conscious volition leads to the verdict that the death benefits cannot be awarded. The court will render a decision denying the claim for compensation."
"Lavern Bracy, the appellant mother, filed a wrongful death action against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. after her daughter, Shayla Stewart, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The daughter had a history of mental illness, including bipolar affective disorder diagnosed in 1999 and a commitment for mental health services in 2002 after being found mentally ill. On March 29, 2003, Stewart became agitated in a Denton, Texas Wal-Mart, assaulted her mother and another customer, and was subsequently escorted out and cited by the police for assault by contact.

On August 21, 2003, Stewart purchased a shotgun from a different Wal-Mart store, lying on the federal firearms transaction record by stating she had never been adjudicated mentally ill or confined to a mental institution. The form contained abbreviations and an illegible manager's signature. Stewart died a week later on August 28, 2003.

In her lawsuit, Bracy alleged negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence on the part of the store. Wal-Mart answered and filed for summary judgment claiming that they did not breach a duty of care to Stewart, did not proximately cause her death, and asserting two affirmative defenses: the 'unlawful acts' rule due to Stewart's false answers and a defense under Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code section 93.001(a)(2), which provides a defense where the plaintiff's injuries result from suicide. Wal-Mart further alleged that Bracy could not recover exemplary damages due to the Texas Constitution and that there was no evidence of breach, proximate cause, or gross negligence. 

The 362nd District Court of Denton County granted summary judgment without specifying the grounds. Bracy appealed, focusing on the issue of whether Wal-Mart's breach of duty of care was the proximate cause of her daughter's death, failing to argue against the summary judgment granted on Wal-Mart's affirmative defenses.","The court will affirm the summary judgment on procedural grounds because Bracy did not address each of Wal-Mart's independent grounds for summary judgment in her appeal. Even if Bracy had raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding Wal-Mart's negligence, she waived her right to contest the summary judgment granted on Wal-Mart's affirmative defense of the suicide defense under Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code section 93.001(a)(2). 

Bracy did not dispute that her daughter committed suicide, which is the first element of the defense. The second element required Wal-Mart to show that Stewart’s suicide was the sole cause of the damages. Wal-Mart provided ample proof that Stewart appeared normal and did not exhibit any intent to commit suicide or harm others at the time of the firearm purchase. Furthermore, Wal-Mart provided an affidavit explaining that Stewart’s episode of violence at a Wal-Mart store did not necessarily indicate a mental health adjudication or commitment that should have been recognized by the store where she purchased the firearm.

Bracy’s strategy to allege Wal-Mart's 'lackadaisical' selling of firearms focused on procedural form errors, but she did not show how these errors constituted a breach of care that proximately caused Stewart’s death. Wal-Mart's counter-affidavit clarified that the paperwork errors did not relate to Stewart's eligibility to purchase the rifle and stated that Stewart’s false declaration on the form was the only illegal conduct in the transaction.

Ultimately, the appellate court will rule that Bracy did not produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Wal-Mart breached any applicable legal standards or that any such breach was the cause of her daughter's death. Consequently, the court will determine that since Wal-Mart established the defense of suicide as the sole cause of Stewart's death, summary judgment was correctly granted, leading to affirmation of the trial court's decision in favor of Wal-Mart."
"In September 2017, during Hurricane Harvey, David Woollen and Wayne Hill were performing rescue operations by boat in a flooded area in Hardin County, Texas. Their boat struck an energized power line resulting in electrocution and burns to Woollen and Hill. They subsequently filed a negligence lawsuit against Entergy Texas, Inc., the operator of the power line, claiming Entergy had breached its duty by failing to take proper precautions such as de-energizing the power lines to protect rescuers during the hurricane. Woollen testified that he had heard that power was supposed to be off, but neither he nor Hill had contacted Entergy about the power lines before the accident. Witnesses to the accident confirmed they were trying to stay away from the power lines because of uncertainty regarding their status, and that the contact occurred when the boat drifted towards a line.

Entergy countered with an affirmative defense of negligence per se on part of the plaintiffs, claiming a violation of Texas Health & Safety Code §§ 752.001-.008, which sets forth requirements for activities near high voltage overhead power lines. Entergy posited that because Plaintiffs engaged in activity that brought the boat — without prior arrangements for safety measures — within the six-feet safety perimeter of the high voltage overhead power line, they had to indemnify Entergy for all liabilities and damages incurred from the electrical contact. Entergy insisted this circular indemnity claim means that Plaintiffs' own claims are legally extinguished.

Plaintiffs argued Chapter 752 of the code was not applicable during natural disaster rescue efforts and on water, as opposed to land, buildings, or highways. They suggested interpreting the statute to apply only to anticipated work around power lines. The trial court denied Entergy's motion for summary judgment, prompting Entergy to appeal on grounds that Chapter 752's provisions did apply to the incident.","The Court of Appeals will reverse the trial court's denial of Entergy's motion for summary judgment based on the interpretation of Chapter 752. The verdict is expected to outline that the broad language of the statute clearly extends to both employment and non-employment activities, utilizing terms like ""work,"" ""activity,"" or ""function,"" and does not exempt private persons engaged in rescue operations. The court will insist that the intent behind the statute is to ensure safety near power lines and place the burden of liability on anyone performing activities near power lines, regardless of their intent or whether it involves work.

The Court of Appeals will reason that the flooded property under the boat remains a ""premises"" as defined by law, and thus, the rescuers should have arranged safety measures before engaging in the activity. Regardless of the plaintiffs’ lack of intention to perform work near the power lines, plaintiffs were engaged in an activity that brought them within proximity to a high voltage line, making them liable for not notifying Entergy in advance.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals will highlight that the indemnity provisions of Chapter 752 will apply even in the face of allegations of negligence against Entergy. Since there are no explicit exclusions for persons performing rescue operations in the legislation, plaintiffs' claims will be considered extinguished by the statute's circular indemnity provision. The verdict will be detailed, acknowledging the legislative history but chiefly relying on the plain language of the law and the implications of the plaintiffs' noncompliance. As a consequence, Entergy’s appeal will be sustained, the trial court's Amended Order will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with the verdict of the Court of Appeals."
"Cecil Blan was found slumped over in the shower by his family and was rushed to the emergency room of Memorial City Hospital on July 18, 1994. Blan, 54 years old at the time, had a history of systematic lupus erthematosus and a prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA), or stroke. Blan's wife immediately informed Dr. Ali, a cardiologist who Blan had visited a few days prior. Dr. Ali consulted by phone with Dr. Bartasis, the emergency room physician, and instructed him to call a neurologist. After administering tests, hospital staff admitted Blan under Dr. Ali's care, and Blan suffered another stroke that afternoon.

The Blans filed a medical malpractice suit against both Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis. The appellants alleged Dr. Ali was negligent in several ways, including failing to properly investigate Blan's medical history, not examining Blan in person, delaying treatment, and not securing a timely examination by a neurologist or admitting Blan to the ICU promptly. Allegations against Dr. Bartasis included delaying treatment and negligent monitoring.

To substantiate their claim, the Blans relied on the affidavit of Dr. Reisbord, a neurologist with over 35 years of experience and over 20 years as a board-certified neurologist. Dr. Reisbord testified that the standard of care he described in his affidavit applied to ""any physician, regardless of his/her area of expertise, that undertakes to treat and care for a patient suffering from a stroke."" However, during a deposition, Dr. Reisbord acknowledged he had no knowledge of the standard of care for emergency medicine physicians or cardiologists. The trial court struck down his testimony regarding the standard of care for these specialties and granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis, as the Blans offered no evidence on the element of proximate cause.","The appellate court will affirm the judgment that Dr. Reisbord had the necessary knowledge to testify on the standard of care for cardiology and emergency medicine because he could describe the general standard applying to treating stroke patients, which includes some aspects relevant to the specialties in question. Nonetheless, it will be predicted that the appellate court will also find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment based on the Blans' failure to provide evidence for the causation element of their negligence claim – a critical component in a medical malpractice lawsuit to avoid summary judgment.

The court will reason that Dr. Reisbord's affidavit lacked vital details on how the alleged negligence caused Blan's deterioration, which potential treatments could have led to a better outcome, or why these could have led to improvement. As the affidavit was considered conclusory and insufficient to create a fact issue on causation, the claim will not survive summary judgment. The court will also dismiss the testimony of Mary Blan, the wife of Cecil Blan, as it did not directly establish that the alleged negligence by Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis was the proximate cause of Blan's injuries, but merely established that Blan did not contribute to his own stroke. With the lack of evidence of proximate cause in response to the appellees' summary judgment motions, the verdict will be that Drs. Ali and Bartasis were rightfully entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of proximate cause, and the trial court's decision will be upheld."
"Mrs. Simpson first visited the Seagoville Medical Center, owned by PMH, on April 15, 1991, due to a lump in her right breast. Dr. Coats examined her and found no palpable masses or nodes. On June 11, 1991, Mrs. Simpson returned with the same complaint, and Coats referred her for a mammography, which showed no evidence of a dominant mass or malignancy, and her routine lab tests were normal. She visited again on July 29, 1991, when Coats detected a lesion, and on September 26, 1991, Coats referred Mrs. Simpson to Dr. Constantine.

Dr. Constantine saw Mrs. Simpson on September 30, 1991, did not detect a discrete mass, and did not refer her for a biopsy due to the earlier mammogram results indicating only fibrocystic changes. Mrs. Simpson was diagnosed with breast cancer on November 4, 1991, and passed away on March 14, 1993.

Tony Ray Simpson filed a medical negligence action under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Texas Survival Statute, alleging that Coats and Constantine's treatment was negligent and the proximate cause of Mrs. Simpson's death. Coats and Constantine sought summary judgment, contending the treatment was not the proximate cause of death. The trial court granted Coats's and Constantine's motions for summary judgment. PMH also filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, contending that Simpson's claims against it were derivative of the claims against the doctors.

In response to the motions for summary judgment, Simpson provided affidavits from Dr. Calkins and Dr. Spoll, stating that the treatment ""may have been a proximate cause"" of Mrs. Simpson's death, and emphasized the importance of early cancer detection. Coats's and Constantine's affidavits contended that even with early diagnosis, the outcome would not have been different due to the aggressive nature of this type of cancer.","The key issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the appellees by determining there was not a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause of Mrs. Simpson's death. In evaluating the grant of summary judgment for Dr. Coats and Dr. Constantine, the appellate court had to consider whether the appellees negated one of the essential elements of the medical malpractice claim, specifically proximate cause, as a matter of law.

Based on the evidence attached to the appellees' motions for summary judgment, including their affidavits and deposition transcripts, the court would likely find that the affidavits from appellees established as a matter of law that any deficiency in the treatment of Mrs. Simpson was not the proximate cause of her death. Furthermore, the affidavits from the appellant's experts, which suggested the treatment ""may have been a proximate cause"" of death, would likely be determined not to raise a fact issue beyond mere conjecture or possibility, as required under applicable law.

In reviewing the summary judgment for PMH, given that Simpson conceded that the claims against PMH were based upon Coats's alleged negligence and are derivative in nature, the appellate court will probably affirm the summary judgment for PMH if it also affirms the judgment for Coats.

Considering the applicable standards of review and the legal requirements for establishing proximate cause in medical malpractice cases, the appellate court will likely affirm the trial court's judgment. The appellant's inability to provide evidence of a ""reasonable medical probability"" that absence of any alleged negligence by the doctors would have altered the outcome of Mrs. Simpson's condition would be a critical factor in the court's analysis. As a consequence, the court would conclude that the appellee doctors and hospital established the absence of proximate cause, and the appellant failed to raise a factual issue sufficient to warrant a trial."
"This case revolves around a premises-liability lawsuit filed by Sajjad Hussain, a clerk at a convenience store and gas station, against the owners of the premises, including appellant Tariq Majeed. Hussain attributes his injury, which resulted in permanent vision loss in his right eye, to an assault by an unidentified male who threw a can of ""Fix-a-Flat Tire"" through a sliding glass ""drive-through"" window at him during his shift. Hussain alleges that the owners, Majeed and a co-defendant, Muhammed Naeem, were negligent by failing to install bulletproof glass in the window and other reasonable security measures to protect against a foreseeable risk of crime, given that the incident occurred in a high-crime area. 

The trial took place without the presence of Majeed or Naeem, with Majeed represented by counsel and Naeem having left the country. Majeed was incarcerated at the time for unrelated offenses. Hussain was the only witness to testify in person, describing his responsibilities, the broken condition of the sliding glass window, and the circumstances of the assault. In the end, the jury found Majeed's negligence had proximately caused Hussain's injuries, rejecting Majeed's motion for a directed verdict, which was not re-urged after the close of evidence. They awarded Hussain $377,811.19 in damages.

Majeed appealed, contending there was insufficient evidence of a foreseeable risk of harm, a duty of care, a breach of duty causing harm, and the amount of damages awarded. Majeed also contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish cause in fact because there was only speculation about whether a bulletproof window would have been closed at the time of the assault. Furthermore, Majeed argued that other no-evidence complaints were preserved for appeal despite not re-urging the directed-verdict motion at the close of evidence because they were included in a motion for a new trial.","The appeals court will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial, focusing on the proximate cause issue. Predicting the court's reasoning, they will explain that to establish proximate cause, an act or omission must be a substantial factor in causing the injury without which the harm would not have occurred. The appeals court will find there is legally insufficient evidence or at best, factually insufficient evidence of proximate cause, particularly concerning the cause-in-fact. It will contend that the jury could only have speculated whether the window, if repaired and made of bulletproof glass, would have been closed at the time of the assault. Furthermore, since Hussain did not see the customer pick up the can and was surprised by the throw, it suggests that even if the window were capable of being closed, Hussain could not have foreseen and prevented the injury by closing the window.

The appeals court will also note that there is no evidence suggesting the presence of a security guard or other measures would have prevented the attack, given its sudden nature. Based on these factors, the court will determine that the injury would not necessarily have been prevented by the alleged negligence by Majeed—that there is no evidence that Hussain's injury would not have occurred but for the lack of bulletproof glass or other security measures. Therefore, the court will conclude that the evidence of causation is either legally or factually insufficient, sustaining Majeed's second issue on appeal and rendering the remaining issues moot, resulting in a new trial focused on Hussain's claims."
"Alfredo and Frances Moreno, plaintiffs, brought a medical malpractice action after their daughter, Bernadette Moreno, died at Del Sol Medical Center under the care of Dr. Edward Juarez and Physician Assistant Roy Malphurs. Bernadette was in hypertensive crisis, experiencing respiratory distress with high blood pressure and low blood oxygen saturation. Nurse Ruddy informed Cardiologist Dr. Joseph Quintana about Bernadette's condition at around 3:30 a.m., after which Dr. Quintana ordered medication to lower her blood pressure but did not physically examine her. Despite treatment, her blood pressure remained elevated. After an attempt to prepare Bernadette for a CAT scan using contrast dye, she went into emergency respiratory distress due to congestive heart failure. Dr. Adolfo Palomino attempted intubation, during which Bernadette went into a pulseless electrical heart rhythm and died following complications from the failed intubation.

The parents filed suit against Dr. Quintana and Del Sol Medical Center alleging medical malpractice and negligent credentialing of Physician Assistant Malphurs. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted, leading to take-nothing judgments against the Morenos. The trial court sustained objections to exclude expert witness testimony from Dr. David Ostrander and struck documentary evidence of Dr. Quintana's orders for Bernadette’s treatment.

On appeal, the Morenos argued the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence and contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgments. The appellate court evaluated whether the trial court properly excluded evidence, including expert affidavits and deposition testimony, and whether summary judgment was correctly awarded under no-evidence grounds on the issues of breach of standard of care and proximate cause.","The court will reverse the trial court’s awards of summary judgment, as the trial court improperly granted both motions. First, on evaluating whether Dr. Quintana breached the standard of care, the issue will focus on what information Nurse Ruddy provided to Dr. Quintana during the 3:30 a.m. call. The credibility of Nurse Ruddy's account that he indeed informed Dr. Quintana of Bernadette’s vital signs will play a crucial role because it contradicts Dr. Quintana's assertion that he lacked sufficient information to warrant a personal evaluation of Bernadette. Since summary judgment is improper when the resolution of a material fact relies on the credibility of witness testimony, the trial court will be found to have erred in this respect.

Regarding the proximate cause element, the evidence will suggest that Dr. Quintana’s failure to provide aggressive treatment contributed to Bernadette's deterioration and subsequent need for intubation. Thus, a fact issue will exist on causation as the Morenos presented more than a mere scintilla of evidence that could lead reasonable minds to different conclusions about the cause of death.

As for the negligent credentialing allegations against Del Sol Medical Center concerning Physician Assistant Malphurs, the court will hold that Texas Occupations Code Section 160.010(b), which offers immunity for credentialing activities absent malice, does not apply to the credentialing of a physician assistant. Therefore, the Morenos will not need to demonstrate malicious intent, as such credentialing does not necessitate this higher burden.

Ultimately, since native evidentiary rulings and the trial court's no-evidence summary judgment grounds will not support the court's judgment, the appellate court will sustain the appeal based on the issues raised by the Morenos and remand the case for trial. The court will underscore that genuine issues of material fact exist, and issues of witness credibility and weight are the province of the fact-finder rather than summary adjudication. The reversal will allow the Morenos the opportunity for a trial to examine the full extent of the evidence and determine liability for the alleged malpractice and negligent credentialing."
"Respondent worker Sue Allbritton was injured when she slipped on a pipe rack that was wet from efforts to extinguish a fire at Texaco Chemical Company's facility. The fire originated from a pump manufactured by petitioner manufacturer Union Pump Company. This particular pump had caught fire twice before. During the incident, which occurred on September 4, 1989, Allbritton, having just finished her shift, volunteered to assist in quelling the fire. Following the fire's extinguishment, an issue with a nitrogen purge valve arose, making it seem like an emergency was still ongoing. Allbritton accompanied her supervisor to the valve over the wet and slippery aboveground pipe rack, as opposed to taking a safer, alternative route. After being informed that it was unnecessary to block the valve, they chose to return across the pipe rack, during which Allbritton was injured.

Allbritton sued Union Pump, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and strict liability, claiming the defective pump was a proximate or producing cause of her injuries. She contended that if not for the pump fire, she wouldn't have walked over the pipe rack, which was rendered hazardous due to the firefighting efforts. Union Pump moved for summary judgment, arguing that their conduct or product was not a legal cause of Allbritton's injuries. The trial court granted this summary judgment, which was later reversed and remanded by the court of appeals due to raised issues of fact concerning proximate and producing cause. Union Pump then challenged the court of appeals' judgment.

The overarching legal question pertained to whether the condition, act, or omission that Allbritton complained of was too remote to constitute legal causation. The case centered on the conditions necessary for legal causation, especially whether Union Pump's negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Allbritton's injury. The case also discussed the elements of negligence and strict liability, the definitions of proximate and producing cause, and summarized judgments from other related cases.","The verdict reasoned that in order for negligence to legally cause another's harm, it must be a substantial factor in causing the injury. The court held that legal causation was not established because Union Pump's conduct or product only created the condition that allowed the injury to occur, not that it substantially caused it. The fire being extinguished and the emergency having abated, Allbritton was no longer operating under the immediate threat of the fire, thus severing the legal causative link between the fire and her later choice to traverse the pipe rack unsafely.

The circumstances of the injury being indirectly connected with Union Pump's conduct or product were deemed too remote to constitute legal causation. Therefore, the court predicted it would reverse the decision of the court of appeals and render judgment for Union Pump, directing that Allbritton take nothing. The projected reasoning was that the condition created by the fire was simply a backdrop and the fire's immediate effects had ceased by the time of Allbritton's injury, making her actions and the conditions of the pipe rack, not the pump fire, the direct causes of her injury. Additional discussion by Justice Cornyn, in concurrence, contemplated the causes in a broader legal context, including the nuances of cause-in-fact versus proximate cause, emphasizing the need for a clear causal link and policy-based reasons for limiting liability. Meanwhile, Justice Spector, dissenting, believed the emergency situation from the fire had not fully resolved, and that causation was not negated to a degree warranting summary judgment."
"The case involves an insurance company (appellant) appealing a decision made by the District Court of Harris County (Texas). The district court had set aside an award previously made by the State Industrial Accident Board and awarded Mrs. Maggie Singleton (appellee), the mother of the deceased G.A. Singleton, 60 percent of her son’s weekly salary in a lump sum after his death, resulting from an injury sustained while on the job. On April 20, 1927, G.A. Singleton was employed by the Houston Park Corporation when he sustained an injury leading to his death. The Park Corporation was insured by the American Employers' Insurance Company, and as the deceased was unmarried, his mother was his sole heir and beneficiary. Mrs. Singleton filed a claim with the State Industrial Accident Board and subsequently in the district court to receive compensation as a lump sum, also accounting for attorney’s fees.

The insurance company's appeal included several contentions: firstly, that error was made by allowing witness testimony regarding the deceased's pain because the witness was not medically qualified; secondly, that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that the deceased was not already in a diseased condition prior to the injury; thirdly, it was argued that the deceased's weekly salary should not have been submitted to the jury for determination due to his short tenure of employment (only 18 days before injury); and lastly, the insurance company argued that the case should not have considered any alleged illness of the deceased as it was not pleaded in the initial arguments.

The testimony from Mrs. Singleton, a coworker, and a medical doctor supported the claim that G.A. Singleton was in robust health prior to the accident. A coworker, Mrs. Mackey, witnessed the injury's immediate aftermath and Dr. Shilling testified regarding the medical condition that ensued post-accident, supporting the contention that the injury led to the deceased’s deteriorating health and eventual death.","The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the mother. The court’s rationale was that the testimony of the witness, J.S. Damon, regarding the pain experienced by the deceased, was acceptable as it echoed the statements made by the deceased himself, making it admissible as a quote. On the issue of insufficient evidence, the testimony of Mrs. Singleton, the coworker, and the doctor sufficiently countered the claim of pre-existing disease, illustrating the son’s healthy condition prior to the accident.

Regarding the challenge to the submission of the issue of weekly salary, the court noted that while G.A. Singleton only worked for a short period (18 days), it was within the law to establish a wage by alternate methods. The court supported its decision by referencing past case law that allowed a weekly wage to be established in any manner that may seem just and fair to both parties, particularly when employment history did not allow for a straightforward calculation. 

The court did not allow the issue of the deceased's supposed prior illness to be presented to the jury as the appellant failed to plead it specifically as a defense, thus adhering to the legal principle that defenses must be specifically pleaded to be considered.

In conclusion, the court held that the appellant’s claims of error were not sustainable as the trial court’s judgment was supported by adequate evidence and legal precedent. The mother was entitled to her compensation as ruled by the lower court, free of any reversible errors, resulting in the insurance company's appeal being dismissed."
"Nathaniel Cooper, an employee of United Parcel Services, Inc. (UPS), died of a heart attack while working in a warehouse. He had a congenital heart block, had undergone several heart surgeries, and had a pre-existing heart condition. On the day of the incident, he was working light duty due to his heart condition. Following his death, his fiancée Terrica Barnes filed a workers' compensation claim as next of kin for their son, Kainan. The Texas Department of Workers' Compensation (DWC) found Cooper's heart attack to be the result of the natural progression of his pre-existing condition, not substantially contributed to by his work, and thus not compensable under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.

Barnes then filed a wrongful death lawsuit alleging gross negligence against UPS. She argued that UPS's failure to install an appropriate ventilation system and implement procedures to protect from high temperatures constituted gross negligence. UPS countered that the lawsuit was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel because the causation issue had been litigated and decided in the DWC hearing. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS based on these grounds. Barnes appealed, claiming the Texas Constitution and section 408.001(b) of the Texas Labor Code protected her right to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence. She further contended that the causation issues in the DWC hearing were not identical to those in the gross negligence suit, and therefore, collateral estoppel did not apply.","In the upcoming verdict, the court will likely reason that the gross negligence action is distinct from the workers' compensation claim heard by the DWC. The DWC's decision focused on whether Cooper's work was a substantial contributing factor to his heart attack under section 408.008 of the Texas Labor Code. The gross negligence claim, on the other hand, involves assessing whether UPS's conduct was a cause of injury and whether it was grossly negligent by being aware of, and acting with conscious indifference to, an extreme degree of risk. Therefore, the two issues are not identical, as the DWC decision required that work conditions be the dominant contributing factor – a higher causation burden than that of a gross negligence suit.

The court will also address the application of res judicata, concluding that it does not apply because the claim for exemplary damages based on gross negligence is not a claim that could have been raised in the DWC proceedings. The constitutional and statutory provisions protect the separate right of an heir or surviving spouse to pursue exemplary damages, which cannot be remedied through the administrative process established by the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.

Regarding collateral estoppel, the court will determine that the causation issues were not fully and fairly litigated during the DWC compensability hearing because the causation burden in the DWC hearing differs substantially from the one in a gross negligence lawsuit. In a gross negligence suit, the plaintiff needs to prove only that the defendant's conduct was a cause of injury, rather than the greater cause or the sole cause, whereas in a DWC hearing for a heart attack, the work conditions must be shown as a greater factor in comparison to the preexisting condition.

Consequently, the court will reverse the summary judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings, allowing Barnes to pursue her gross negligence lawsuit against UPS."
"In 2013, Bryan Stallworth was charged with assault on a family member, second offense, by impeding breathing. Randall Ayers was appointed by the criminal court to represent Stallworth, who was ultimately convicted. In September 2015, Stallworth, acting pro se, filed a civil lawsuit against Ayers alleging negligence in his representation during the criminal proceedings. He claimed that he provided Ayers with an affidavit from the complainant recanting her allegations, which Ayers failed to present to the court. Additionally, Stallworth alleged Ayers neglected to confront the state with an inadequate complaint under the Code of Criminal Procedure article 15.05(2).

Stallworth asserted that his incarceration was solely due to Ayers' negligence and not his own criminal conduct. He amended his petition to include breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, and violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Stallworth never claimed he was exonerated from the assault offense by direct appeal, habeas corpus, or other methods. Ayers filed a motion to dismiss under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a, contending that as Stallworth was not exonerated, his conviction resulted from his own conduct, not any negligence by Ayers, therefore lacking causation in law for the alleged malpractice.","Upon reviewing the case, it is predicted that the trial court's dismissal of Stallworth's lawsuit will be upheld. The reasoning will largely rest on the application of the decision in Peeler v. Hughes & Luce, where the Texas Supreme Court established that legal malpractice claims against criminal attorneys are barred unless the plaintiff has been exonerated. The court will find that Stallworth’s various claims, despite being labeled as breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, all fundamentally allege inadequate legal representation, and thus, fall under the category of legal malpractice claims. Since Stallworth did not allege exoneration, the court will determine that his criminal conduct is the legal cause of the conviction, and Ayers' conduct, even if proved negligent, would not be considered the proximate cause of the conviction.

Furthermore, the court will not accept the documents Stallworth presented (such as the complainant's affidavit or a fax cover letter to the court) as ""official government documents"" sufficient to overcome the Peeler bar since they were not generated by the government or judicial authority and did not demonstrate formal exoneration. The trial court will be seen to have properly applied Rule 91a, and Stallworth's claims will be considered as having no basis in law because they fail to meet the causation requirement for malpractice claims due to the absence of criminal exoneration. Consequently, not only will the dismissal of Stallworth's claims be affirmed, but Ayers will also be awarded attorney's fees."
"Plaintiffs Ward Howe and his wife Estelle Howe filed a personal injury action against the defendants, which included the County of Victoria, Texas, Citizens Memorial Hospital of Victoria County, Texas, and doctors Dr. George A. Constant and Dr. F. S. Ted Shields. The case related to injuries Mrs. Howe sustained after falling from her bed in the psychiatric ward of the hospital, two hours post receiving an electrical shock treatment (glissando therapy). The treatment was administered by Dr. Shields and a team of nurses and attendants.

The Howes alleged specific acts of negligence on the part of Dr. Shields which they argued led to Mrs. Howe's fall and subsequent injuries. They contended he failed to properly supervise the application of the glissando sheet used for restraining the patient after the shock treatment, did not return to inspect the sheet, and failed to instruct the attendants and nurses to apply restraining bedboards or bed rails. The plaintiffs also alleged negligence against the hospital but encountered a defense of governmental immunity.

During the trial, motions for instructed verdict were filed by the defendants, resulting in a take-nothing judgment by the trial court in favor of the defendants. While the hospital and county invoked their governmental immunity, the doctors contended that there was a failure to prove actionable negligence and lack of evidence supporting a special servant relationship between the doctors and hospital employees.

The trial court agreed with the defenses, and the plaintiffs appealed. The evidence presented and testimony from medical professionals indicated that the restraints used were not foolproof, patients were known to escape them, and the use of bed rails was considered advisable by expert witnesses. Dr. Shields had left after the procedure without ensuring appropriate restraint had been applied.

The hospital and county argued that as governmental agencies, they were immune from tort liability. They also noted that the hospital was legally authorized to accept Mrs. Howe as a paying patient despite her being from a different county, with the factual matters pointing to the established process, organization, and legal underpinnings identifying the hospital as a governmental entity.",The cour
"Petitioners, the City of Lancaster and Lancaster police officers (Petitioners), are seeking a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas which had multiple holdings regarding a case brought by respondent parents (Respondents) on behalf of their son Bradley Chambers, who was seriously injured during a high-speed police chase. The case involved common law negligence claims, as well as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983, against the City of Lancaster, Lancaster and DeSoto police officers. The high-speed chase occurred on August 3, 1986, when a motorcycle driven by Scott Stiles, with Bradley Chambers as a passenger, was pursued by officer Bentley after running a red light. The pursuit escalated, drawing in officers from both DeSoto and Lancaster, culminating in a crash that left Stiles dead and Chambers seriously injured.

The initial summary judgment granted by the trial court for the Petitioners on both negligence and § 1983 claims was partially overturned by the appellate court, which remanded the negligence claim while affirming summary judgment on the § 1983 claim but with different reasoning. The appellate court established the ""shocks the conscience"" test for the excessive force claim under § 1983 and introduced a new standard of good faith to evaluate official immunity regarding the negligence claim. 

Regarding immunity under state law, officers relied on the official immunity defense against the negligence claims, contending that they were not negligent as a matter of law because they owed no duty to Chambers and their actions were not the proximate cause of the accident. Official immunity would apply if a reasonable officer under similar circumstances believed the need to apprehend the suspect outweighed the risk of harm to the public.","The court will affirm the grant of summary judgment for the Petitioners on the civil rights claim asserting that the high-speed chase resulting in injury did not shock the conscience, which aligns with the decision framework specified by the appellate court. While the chase was dangerous, the officers' actions throughout the pursuit were not deemed so brutal and offensive as to meet that standard. The Respondents' negligence claim will be remanded after establishing the good faith test for official immunity under state law. The court will determine on remand whether Petitioner officers engaged in discretionary functions and whether their belief that apprehending the suspect was more important than the risk posed to the public was one a reasonably prudent officer might have held. 

The court, in considering whether the officers acted within the scope of their authority, will likely find that as they were engaged in their official duties during the incident, they operated within their jurisdiction. Additionally, the court will consider whether the cities can be held liable under the Texas Tort Claims Act depending on the outcome of the officer's liability determination, which hinges on the new standard of good faith. Since the court will remand the case to reassess the officer's individual liability, the cities' liability will also need reassessment. The court will assess these factors on remand in alignment with the nuances of the new legal standard set forth by the appellate court."
"Appellee Dental Arts Laboratory, Inc. sued appellant Anna Roach and Stan Horton for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. The district court ruled in favor of the company, leading Roach to appeal the decision. The key points in the case include:
- Roach had entrusted her car to Horton, who had a known addiction to crack cocaine, for repairs.
- Roach and Horton's mother were aware of his addiction but believed he had it ""under control.""
- Horton had previously been successful in repairing Roach's car without incident.
- On June 22, 1998, Roach lent her car to Horton again for repair work and job hunting.
- Horton did not return the car as promised, leading to Roach reporting it to the police.
- The car was involved in an accident and abandoned; the driver at the time was never found.
- Investigation suggested Horton may have loaned or sold the car for crack cocaine.
- A police officer testified that while someone with knowledge of an addict's habits might foresee the possibility of the car being given away, Roach would not likely expect that outcome.
- The officer, having experience with drug cases, believed Roach's decision to entrust the car to Horton, despite his progress, wasn't unreasonable under the circumstances.","The appellate court is expected to reverse the district court's judgment based on the reasoning that:
- The proximate cause has two elements: cause-in-fact and foreseeability.
- While Roach knew of Horton's addiction, there was no evidence suggesting she should have foreseen that he would exchange the car for cocaine.
- The court would note that general knowledge of an addiction does not equal specific knowledge of behavior such as exchanging property for drugs.
- Given Roach's prior experience loaning the car to Horton without issues, it would be unreasonable to expect her to predict the specific criminal act of exchanging the car for drugs.
- The act of the third party (unidentified driver involved in the accident) constituted a superseding cause, which was unforeseeable by Roach.
- The lack of foreseeability in the exchange of the car makes any negligence on Roach's part not the proximate cause of the company's loss.
  
Thus, the appellate court's decision would focus on the lack of foreseeability of the specific criminal act and deem it a superseding cause outside of Roach's control, resulting in a judgment that Dental Arts Laboratory, Inc. take nothing from Roach on its claim."
"The child, her mother, and her aunt resided in a house situated along the railway line belonging to the appellant railway company. On the day of the incident, the mother informed her sister (the child's aunt) that a train was approaching and instructed her to look after the child while she went to wash at a nearby branch, which was about 200 yards from their house and a step from the railroad. Upon the mother's departure, the aunt placed the child on the kitchen floor as she proceeded to wash dishes.

Subsequently, the railway company's fireman discovered the child with its arm severed by the train and brought the child into the house. Both the railway company's engineer and fireman testified that they did not spot the child on the track early enough to halt the train. The railway company requested the trial court to instruct the jury it owed no duty to persons on its tracks, but the request was denied. The jury sided with the child, awarding her $8,000 in damages for personal injuries stemming from the railway company's alleged negligence.

The railway company presented several legal arguments to refute its liability, emphasizing the exclusivity of its ownership and control over the tracks, the improbability of foreseeing children on the tracks, and a limitation on their duty to ordinary care in exercising vigilance for individuals on the tracks not at crossings. Furthermore, they argued that no presumption of negligence should be attached simply due to the presence of an injured party on the tracks. The company also raised issues with the jury instructions concerning the mother's care for the child, given her social and economic situation, as well as with the definition of ""proximate cause."" They criticized the final damages awarded as excessive and unwarranted by the evidence presented.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, relying on the fact that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer negligence on the part of the railway company's employees. The verdict will be supported despite acknowledging the railway company's contention that the railway is not ordinarily expected to anticipate unauthorized individuals, including children, on its tracks.

The reasoning will be that while the railway company has no obligation to expect trespassers between designated crossings, it does owe a duty of ordinary care to avoid injury to others, including in cases involving infant trespassers—such a duty involves maintaining a proper watch. Therefore, the court will determine that there was testimony, both direct and circumstantial, which allowed the jury to conclude that the railway company's employees may have lacked proper watchfulness, thus failing to spot the child in time.

The court will also consider the consistency of witness statements and physical evidence indicating that the train personnel could have seen the child on the track had they been properly attentive. Given that the jury's verdict is being affirmed by the district judge who presided over and heard all the testimonies and evidence during the trial, the court will likely conclude that the jury's decision wasn’t ""clearly wrong.""

As for the amount of damages awarded, the court will hold it as reasonable given the severe and permanent nature of the child’s injuries (loss of an arm). The court will elaborate that the jury is entitled to consider the probable impact on the child’s health, ability to use the limb, and future earning capacity. That the judgment doesn't reflect an oversight in the damages awarded and the instructions provided during the trial for determining them will also be discussed.

Lastly, the possibility of contributory negligence by the mother or the child's aunt will not significantly alter the outcome since the verdict had already taken into consideration the negligence claim against the child's caretakers. However, the court will note that the case details did not necessitate addressing the broader legal question of whether a mother's negligence can be imputed to her child. The court will assert that since the appellant railway company benefited from jury instructions regarding contributory negligence as far as they requested, they cannot claim harm from not getting a further instruction specifically about the aunt's potential negligence."
"The case involves an appellant manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, seeking a review of a judgment awarded to the appellees, a painter, Fred Stephens, and his wife. The case originated in the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County, Texas, where damages were awarded to the Stephens due to the painter's asbestos injury – specifically, mesothelioma. 

Fred Stephens worked in occupations highly exposed to asbestos and asbestos-containing materials for over thirty years. He served in the Navy, worked on the Grand Coulee Dam, and later became a commercial painter, which further exposed him to various asbestos-related products.

The complaint alleged that Fred developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing joint compound products. According to testimony from the painter, his coworkers, and experts, Fred was exposed to multiple products that contained asbestos, and it was suggested that every exposure to such products could be a contributing factor to causing mesothelioma. No scientific evidence, however, was presented to establish a minimum exposure level to asbestos-containing joint compound that would lead to an increased risk of mesothelioma.

Georgia-Pacific Corporation argued that the evidence was legally insufficient because the Stephenses could not prove which specific asbestos product caused Fred's disease nor prove significant exposure to Georgia-Pacific's product specifically. Additional contentions included an error in excluding Fred's affidavit concerning exposure to asbestos gloves manufactured by Guard-Line, insufficiency of evidence to support mental anguish damages, and insufficient evidence to support a jury finding of malice. 

Throughout the case, the concept of specific causation became central, with varying views on the standards required to prove it. Prior cases provided different tests for determining specific causation, leading to uncertainty about the necessary level of exposure to establish liability. Fred Stephens and several coworkers had observed multiple asbestos-containing products at job sites, including Georgia-Pacific's joint compound, among other brands.

Procedural History:
The Stephenses originally sued multiple defendants but by the time of trial had settled all claims except against three defendants including Georgia-Pacific. The case was removed to federal court but then remanded back to state court. At trial, the experts’ testimony asserted that Fred’s asbestos exposure was at levels known to contribute to the development of asbestos-related diseases. The jury found for the Stephenses, but Georgia-Pacific contested the verdict.","The court will reverse and render judgment for the manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific, due to the legal insufficiency of evidence to support the causation finding. The reversal will be based on the application of the Texas Supreme Court's decision in Borg-Warner Corporation v. Flores, asserting that the testimony from the Stephenses’ experts does not satisfy the legal requirements for establishing specific causation. 

The reasoning for this verdict will contend that although the testimony established general exposure to asbestos-containing products, it failed to specifically pinpoint Georgia-Pacific’s joint compound as the substantial factor in causing the mesothelioma. Quantitative evidence about the frequency, regularity, and proximity of Fred's exposure to Georgia-Pacific’s specific product was lacking, which made it impossible to establish that exposure to this product significantly increased Fred's risk of developing mesothelioma.

Furthermore, there will be a requirement for reasonable quantitative evidence correlating the risk of exposure to the product with the development of the illness - a condition not met in this case. Additionally, the 'any exposure' theory will be deemed inadequate for lacking scientific consensus and not aligning with dose-response principles essential in toxic tort cases. Taking into account the epidemiological requirement set forth by the Texas Supreme Court, the verdict will rule out evidence of an 'any exposure' basis as insufficient for proving that Fred's exposure to Georgia-Pacific's joint compound was a substantial factor resulting in his mesothelioma. Thus, the Stephenses will not have met their burden of providing credible scientific evidence of specific causation under the refined standards demanded by recent legal precedents."
"The case involves a dental malpractice lawsuit under the Texas Medical Liability Act, where appellants Michael and Lisa Ann Bell sued appellees Matthew Markham, Jeffry Lynch, and The McKinney Dentist (""TMD"") for alleged dental negligence. The Bells first expert report, provided by Robbie Henwood, D.D.S., was judged insufficient, leading to remand of the case to permit the Bells to serve amended and additional expert reports. On June 8, 2018, the Bells submitted Henwood's amended expert report and provided an additional report by Lane R. Miller, M.D. After the trial court granted a 30-day extension to cure the reports, the appellees pursued dismissal on the grounds that the reports were untimely served, experts were unqualified, and opinions on the standard of care, breaches, and causation were deficient. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, prompting the present appeal.

The Bells challenged the dismissal on five main grounds: (1) that Henwood's and Miller's expert reports were timely served on remand; (2) that Robbie Henwood was qualified to offer expert opinions on causation; (3) that Henwood's amended expert report met statutory requirements; (4) that Lane R. Miller was qualified to offer expert opinions regarding causation; and (5) that Miller's expert report adequately addressed causation.","In the judgment to be reversed and the case remanded, the analysis will likely reveal that the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant's objections regarding the timeliness and qualifications of the experts and the sufficiency of the expert reports. It will be determined that Henwood, being a licensed dentist with relevant training in periodontal disease and expertise in cardiovascular physiology, is indeed qualified to offer expert opinions on the causal relationship between dental care and cardiac conditions. Henwood's report, which was detailed in establishing causation between oral infections and cardiovascular disease, complied with statutory requirements by providing a narrative that explained how untreated periodontal infections could spread and lead to serious conditions such as endocarditis.

Moreover, as a physician, Miller's cardiological expertise was appropriate for discussing causation in a lawsuit against a dentist, especially when it pertains to complications such as endocarditis stemming from oral infections. The appellate court will conclude that the trial court should not have sustained the objections to Miller's report based on his lack of qualifications to render opinions on dental standards of care, as he did not offer such opinions.

Furthermore, it will be concluded that the expert's report need not rule out all possible conditions or sources of infection to be deemed adequate. The reports in question provided enough information to inform the defendants of the conduct in question and to establish the merit of the claims, fulfilling the purpose of the statutory requirement. It will be reasoned that the dismissal at this early stage was inappropriate since the reports represented a good-faith effort to conform to the statutory requirements. The trial court will be found to have abused its discretion by accepting the argument that absolute certainty was necessary from the expert reports at this stage. As a result, the trial court's order granting the motions to dismiss will be overturned and the case will be sent back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion."
"A woman named Mrs. Sarah McCann was killed by a lightning strike while standing on the porch of her home near Taft, Texas, during a rain and electrical storm on August 26, 1932. The telephone company, Western Telephone Corporation of Texas, owned a telephone line composed of ""through"" and ""local"" wires strung on wooden poles near the McCann house. Mrs. McCann’s widower, Jack McCann, and their five children filed a wrongful death suit against the telephone company, alleging negligence in the manner the company disconnected a telephone line that had formerly served the McCann house.

At the time of the incident, the local wire came to a dead end in a nearby residence, with both telephones having been disconnected for some time. In front of the McCann residence, pole ""X"" carried a ""drop"" wire that previously connected the McCann house to the local line. The instrument in the McCann house was removed, and the wire ended at a spool just under the eaves of the front porch, where there was no ground wire or connection to the ground.

Lightning struck pole ""A,"" east of the McCann house, causing the through wire to sever without damaging pole ""X"" or causing disturbance in the other house where the wire dead-ended. The plaintiffs contended that lightning surcharged the local line, traveled to pole ""X,"" then to the drop wire, and subsequently struck Mrs. McCann.

The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment. However, upon further review, the court questioned whether the plaintiffs had sufficiently proven that the negligence of the telephone company was the proximate cause of Mrs. McCann’s death, especially considering expert testimony regarding the behavior of lightning and electrical discharges.","The court will reverse the judgments of the trial court and the intermediate appellate court, remanding for further proceedings. The court will conclude that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof by not providing substantial evidence that the telephone company's negligence directly contributed to Mrs. McCann's death. The testimony of electrical experts, who indicated Mrs. McCann was likely struck by an independent side stroke of lightning, will undermine the plaintiff's claims. The experts' consensus that lightning does not necessarily follow metallic paths and can produce multiple paths to earth will be taken into account, demonstrating that Mrs. McCann could have been killed by a direct lightning strike, independent of any alleged negligence by the telephone company. 

The court will determine that the plaintiff's argument relies on speculation and conjecture rather than tangible evidence that indisputably connects the lightning stroke at pole ""A"" with Mrs. McCann's death. The lack of physical evidence of a connection between the severed wire at pole ""A"" and the McCann front porch—such as burn marks or wire damage—will be particularly influential, as it does not support the theory of an electric current traveling down the local line to the drop wire and then to Mrs. McCann. Additionally, the fact that the conditions in the nearby house where the wire dead-ended were undisturbed will further weaken the plaintiff's position. The court will find the plaintiffs' evidence insufficient to demonstrate that the defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the damage suffered, rather than the strike being an unforeseeable act of nature. Therefore, the court will rule for a reversal due to a lack of legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's original finding of liability against the telephone company."
"Carl Dean Lewis (""Lewis"") began working for Brookshire Brothers, Inc. (""Brookshire"") in 1984, initially as a meat cutter and later as head meat cutter and meat market manager. On July 9, 1990, while working in the meat department of one of Brookshire's grocery stores, he sustained a back injury by lifting a sausage case, resulting in a herniated disc that required back surgery. Following his recovery and return to light duty work on October 8, 1990, Lewis suffered a second back injury on June 10, 1991, while the meat department was short-staffed and the store was having a ground beef sale. The second injury led to another herniated disc and a second surgery on September 24, 1991. In January 1992, despite severe pain and the need for a third surgery, Lewis returned to work with a ""pencil and paper"" light duty restriction.

During the trial, evidence was presented regarding Brookshire's alleged negligence. Testimonies highlighted Brookshire's awareness of inadequate support staff in the meat department and the risks associated with overworking the remaining employees. Specific issues included the danger of regularly lifting heavy lugs of meat, with some lugs weighing as much as 70 to 75 pounds and the process requiring lifting above shoulder level. Experts testified about the lack of specific safety instructions and the unsafe equipment, particularly the uncomfortable height of the grinder and the weight of the lugs.

The court found that Brookshire, a nonsubscriber under the Texas workers' compensation law, was responsible for work-related injuries under common law principles of negligence and that comparative negligence was inapplicable as a defense in this situation. The case went to a jury, and damages totaling $300,000 were awarded. Brookshire appealed the decision of the 221st District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, resulting in this review.","The appellate court affirmed the award of damages to Lewis for several reasons. First, Brookshire's negligence in failing to provide adequate staff support and ensuring a safe work environment was a proximate cause of Lewis's injuries. Given the evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that the inadequate staffing led to an overburdened Lewis, who had to perform unsafe job activities under risky conditions. In addition, the court acknowledged that while Brookshire contended that Lewis performed usual and customary work, the circumstances of the day of injury—with an ongoing sale and staff shortages—made the danger foreseeable and the injury reasonably anticipated.

As Brookshire was a nonsubscriber to the Texas workers' compensation law, comparative negligence was not an applicable defense, so the trial court correctly did not reduce the award based on Lewis's alleged contributory negligence. The court further held that sufficient evidence supported Lewis's claim for both past and future physical impairment, and thus Brookshire's claims concerning lack of evidence for mental anguish were without merit. Brookshire also failed to substantiate its claim for offset of damages and showed no error in the trial court's decision to refuse certain jury instructions, which were deemed unnecessary and potentially confusing.

Finally, the court found no basis to grant Brookshire's request for a remittitur as it did not align with the claims made during the trial proceedings. All of Brookshire's challenges to the trial court's decisions were overruled, resulting in the upholding of the jury's damages award to Lewis."
"Robert B. Dean filed a lawsuit against over twenty loan companies and three insurance companies, accusing them of charging him usurious interest on loans and causing damages through aggressive collection efforts. During the course of the case, many of the defendants were either dismissed or settled, leaving a few defendants when the case proceeded to trial. The trial encompassed more than 300 issues presented to the jury, which resulted in various judgments against several defendants:

- Western Guaranty Loan Company was ordered to pay $224.40 as double usury charges (punitive damages for excessive interest) and $1,800 for reckless collection efforts.
- Louis K. Cassett, J. H. Pollack, and Joseph H. Pollack, doing business as Royal Finance Company, were ordered to pay $174.56 as double usury charges and $600 for reckless collection efforts.
- Chlo Vean Smith Wheatley was ordered to pay $40.98 as double usury charges and initially $1,800 for reckless collection efforts, which was later reduced to $800 upon remittitur by the trial court.
- Judgments non obstante veredicto were rendered in favor of Bankers Health and Accident Company, City National Life Insurance Company, and Southern Life Insurance Company, dismissing them from the case.
- Judgments were rendered in favor of W. L. Caldwell and Mrs. J. A. Allison, owners of Triangle Loan Service, based on the jury verdict.

Several points of appeal were raised, including whether the collection efforts justified the damages awarded and whether specific charges could be considered part of usurious interest. Key issues debated included whether credit insurance premiums could be regarded as part of usurious interest charged, the application of payments made by Dean (which might otherwise be subject to the statute of limitations), collective responsibility for the damages, and improper service of citation based on marital status and other procedural errors. Another pertinent aspect was whether the insurance companies, as principals of the loan companies who acted as their agents, could be liable for the usurious interest due to the insurance premiums rolled into the loans.","In the appellate decision, the verdict is a mixture of affirmations, reversals, and modifications to the trial court's judgment:

- The court is expected to agree with Dean on the inclusion of credit insurance premiums as part of the usurious interest, given the jury's support and adequate evidence, meaning these premiums will be factored into the usurious interest.
- The court will likely modify the judgment against Western Guaranty Loan Company, reducing it by $122.40, due to the statute of limitations affecting part of the usury calculations.
- There will probably be an assertion that no new service of citation was necessary when amended pleadings only increased the damages sought and did not constitute a new cause of action.
- It is probable that the appellate court will clarify that a judgment against an individual concerning their business dealings while married should stand if the individual participates in the legal process subsequently.
- The court is anticipated to reverse and remand the decisions related to damages for reckless collection efforts by certain defendants, noting the incorrect handling of indivisible damages.
- The appellate court decision is likely to reaffirm the trial court’s judgment for usury and penalties against Royal Finance Company and Chlo Vean Wheatley.
- It is expected that the court will dispute the liability of the insurance companies for usurious interest on the grounds that interest and usury pertain to a lending relationship, which is not the case between Dean and the insurance companies. 
- Judgments relating to the insurance companies are expected to be affirmed given that the insurance companies received premiums for insurance policies and not for interest on loans. Since the insurance premiums were not considered usury under the money borrowed, the insurance companies are not to be held liable on usury grounds.
- It is envisaged that the appellant's arguments challenging the sufficiency of service due to marital status changes will likely fail due to appearances made in the process, curing any defects in the service.
- Decisions in favor of defendants with whom Dean has settled are anticipated to be upheld, and the appellate court is expected to reject the notion that settlements with some defendants could extinguish the cause of action entirely.
- The court is expected to uphold the judgments for usury and penalties, albeit with some modifications, and is forecasted to require a retrial for the assessment of collective damages due to wrongful collection efforts.

"The appellant, a property owner, sought review after the District Court of Travis County (Texas) ruled in favor of the City, sustaining demurrers (objections) and granting judgment for the City in a case where the property owner sought to recover damages. These damages were claimed for injuries and deaths of his livestock, which were said to be caused by mud banks and stagnant water. The water levels in the river adjacent to the owner's property had been lowered during the construction of a dam by the city, resulting in the formation of these dangerous conditions. The owner claimed that several of his horses died after getting mired in the mud, and others were injured or died from the effects after being rescued.

The appellant sought recovery for the value of the horses that died, the deterioration in value of the horses that were injured, and the expenses incurred in efforts to protect the animals from the hazard, treat their injuries, and feed them. The petition including these claims had paragraphs (12th and 13th) and a trial amendment detailing the damages, which were questioned on the grounds of certainty, remoteness, and ownership of the feed provided to the livestock. Demurrers to these concerns were sustained by the lower court, prompting the property owner to appeal the decision.","On appeal, it is anticipated that the court will reverse the decision of the lower court, finding that the city is liable for the damages sustained by the property owner's livestock due to the formation of mud banks as a natural and probable consequence of the city's actions. The reasonable expenses incurred in guarding the stock, moving them to safety, and returning them, as well as efforts to treat injured horses, will be acknowledged as recoverable damages. The court will likely reason that since the city's construction of the dam caused the hazardous mud banks, the property owner should not be precluded from using his property and protecting his livestock from danger. 

Furthermore, the court will opine that the owner has the right to engage in reasonable actions to safeguard his property from the dangers created by the wrongful acts of the city, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard should be covered. It is also projected that the court will hold the city liable for the difference between the expense and cost of keeping the livestock before the tort and the value of the hay and sorghum feed, if such expense was necessary and reasonable. Additionally, the court is expected to remand the case for a new trial to properly consider which specific damages are recoverable based on detailed and precise pleadings that avoid confusion around the number and condition of the horses affected, as well as to reconcile any inconsistencies in the amounts claimed. The court will encourage precision in establishing the recoverable damages, and only those that are proximate and not remote will be awarded. However, the court will not limit the property owner from pursuing the full measure of damages that naturally follow from the wrongful act, and will clarify that damages need not be foreseeable to be recoverable, as long as they are the natural and direct consequence of the wrongful act."
"The plaintiffs in this case are over 400 homeowners who reside in the upper White Oak Bayou watershed in Harris County, Texas. Their homes suffered from flooding multiple times due to Tropical Storm Francis in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, and another unnamed storm in 2002. The homeowners filed suit against Harris County and the Harris County Flood Control District, alleging a takings cause of action, contending that the county approved new residential developments without fully implementing a previously approved flood-control plan (the Pate Plan), an action which they believed was a substantial factor leading to the flooding of their homes.

The report covered 61 square miles of the upper White Oak Bayou drainage basin and mentioned recurring flooding. Subsequent plans, including the Pate Plan and the Klotz Plan, were conceived with flood prevention in mind, but there were shifts in focus from managing 100-year floods to managing 10-year floods due to technological and financial constraints. The plaintiffs argued that their homes would not have flooded but for the county's actions, and specifically, the failure to implement the Pate Plan would have mitigated the floods. The County's position was it never intended to cause flooding; their efforts were in prevention and control of flooding and that multiple factors, not just the approval of development, contributed to the flooding of the plaintiff's properties.","Predicting the Supreme Court of Texas' reasoning, it is likely the Court will find in favor of the defendants, Harris County and the Harris County Flood Control District. The Court may hold that the plaintiffs failed to establish a cognizable takings claim because they were unable to prove the required elements, particularly intent and causation, connected to the alleged taking of their properties. For a case to qualify as a compensable taking, the Court would require a demonstration that the government intentionally took or damaged property for public use, or that such result was substantially certain to occur due to government action.

The Court would likely highlight that the plaintiffs did not present enough evidence to show the County was substantially certain that the homeowners' particular properties would flood due to its approvals of private development plans. Even if the approval of development can be seen as an affirmative act, the lack of concrete connection to specific foreseeable damage to the homeowners' properties undermines the takings claim. Furthermore, the defendants' efforts to prevent flooding through different control measures and adaptation of plans over the years may be seen as indicative of their intent to mitigate, rather than cause, flooding.

Given the absence of specific evidence that the County had designs to inundate the homeowners' properties as part of a flood-control plan, the Court might articulate that the County did not use the homeowners' properties for detention ponds, drainage easements, or similar purposes. Accordingly, the Court could rule that the approval of private development by the County does not satisfy the public use requirement necessary for a takings claim, and in fact poses serious questions about whether there was a government taking at all.

Lastly, the Court may point out that property damage was likely the accidental result of government acts, which does not constitute a public use, and emphasize the constitutional significance of sovereign immunity. This suggests that the homeowners' argument would potentially transform the government into an insurer of natural disasters and unavoidable accidents, an untenable position for a governmental entity. The verdict would likely conclude that the homeowners' theory, if accepted, could severely limit the ability of governments to function and finance necessary services, emphasizing that governments can't be expected to guarantee against every misfortune. Therefore, on these grounds, the Court would probably dismiss the case."
"A medical malpractice action arose from the death of Bob Hogue, who died after medical staff failed to timely provide necessary services to diagnose his condition. On March 5, 1998, Bob Hogue complained of an upset stomach and dizziness. Dr. Jay Story examined him the next day and diagnosed him with pneumonia, prescribing medicine and scheduling a follow-up appointment. Hogue's condition worsened and he was sent to Columbia Medical Center of Las Colinas, where Dr. Blomquist advised he be placed on a ventilator. Dr. Schroeder, a specialist, and Dr. Blomquist concluded that Hogue would need a cardiologist consult and an echocardiogram (echo). However, the hospital, which had elected to outsource echo services, had not guaranteed a response time for such studies.

The echo, critical for diagnosing Hogue's condition, was significantly delayed as the echo technician was not given the impression that Hogue needed urgent attention. The study was not completed until about three hours after it was ordered, identifying a severe leakage of Hogue's mitral valve, which required emergency surgery. Hogue was then transferred to another hospital for surgery but died shortly after arrival.

Hogue's family sued Columbia Medical Center for medical malpractice, asserting survival and wrongful-death claims. The jury found the hospital negligent and grossly negligent, initially awarding over $30 million in damages. The trial court and Court of Appeals reduced this, and the hospital appealed, challenging several issues including the legal sufficiency of evidence for gross negligence, loss of inheritance damages, and the application of interest rates on the judgment.","The Court will find the majority of the judgment against Columbia Medical Center appropriate. The trial court did not err in refusing to submit a contributory negligence question in the first trial phase because there was no evidence that doctors would have acted differently if Hogue had disclosed his heart murmur diagnosis. There existed clear and convincing evidence that the hospital was grossly negligent: it decided not to provide timely echo services by not securing a guaranteed response time for outsourced echo services, did not inform its medical staff of this limitation, and thus dangerously delayed a critical diagnostic service to Hogue, contributing to his death.

However, the evidence for loss of inheritance damages, awarded to Hogue’s widow, will be considered insufficient as it failed to prove that Mrs. Hogue would outlive her husband based on health, or that Hogue's future earnings would exceed his expenditures, leaving an estate for inheritance. The calculation of these damages did not account for all variables specific to Hogue's situation.

Furthermore, amendments to the Texas Finance Code regarding interest rates on judgments will not apply to this case, as the final judgment was signed before the effective dates of the amendments, and the appeal could not have commenced after the amendments' effective dates.

Therefore, the Court will reverse the award for loss of inheritance damages but affirm the remainder of the judgment, including the reduced actual damages and capped exemplary damages based on the finding of gross negligence."
"The case involves the appellant, The Upjohn Company (Upjohn), and the appellees, William R. Freeman and his family (the Family), which includes his wife and children. The Family brought a negligence and products liability action against Upjohn due to injuries William Freeman allegedly suffered from using Halcion, a prescription sleeping pill manufactured by Upjohn. 

During the trial, Upjohn was found to be grossly negligent, and the jury awarded zero damages to Freeman but awarded actual and exemplary damages to the Family. The jury found for damages related to the loss of consortium to Freeman's wife and children, as well as loss-of-support damages. However, the trial court entered a take-nothing judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Upjohn on the loss-of-support damages. 

Upon appeal, Upjohn contended that the statute of limitations barred the Family's claims, the damage awards were not sustainable as a matter of law, and the evidence supporting the causation findings was legally and factually insufficient. The Family asserted that the trial court erred in not entering judgment regarding the jury's award for loss of support and in applying settlement credits due to settling defendants.

A detailed examination of the case revealed that Upjohn could not conclusively prove that the Family's causes of action had accrued outside the statutory period, which would invoke the defenses related to the statute of limitations. The Family's pleading was found to be sufficient to invoke the ""continuing-tort"" rule, as Freeman continued to take Halcion, unaware of its side effects, until his incarceration.","The court will likely reverse the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees, William R. Freeman and his family, because they could not recover loss of consortium and exemplary damages without Freeman suffering actual injuries from the use of Upjohn's product. There is no legal basis for an award of loss of consortium if the Family cannot establish that Upjohn's actions or product caused actual injury to Freeman. The court will affirm the trial court's decision to enter a take-nothing judgment on the loss-of-support claim since such damages are not recoverable in a personal injury action, being distinct to wrongful death actions. Given that the jury found no damage award for Freeman, the award for loss of consortium is negated, as it is a derivative claim from the primary personal injury claim. Furthermore, because exemplary damages are contingent upon actual damage, the jury's award of zero damages for Freeman would eliminate the possibility of recovering exemplary damages. The Family's arguments attempting to circumvent the requirement of establishing actual damages for Freeman will likely be deemed insufficient, as the court will find that no specific jury finding indicated that Upjohn's actions or product caused injury to Freeman. Thus, the judgment in favor of Upjohn will be rendered a take-nothing outcome."
"The appellant, an employee, suffered personal injuries from an oil well perforating gun explosion while rigging at a well site. The appellant was employed by McCullough Tool Company, and the owner of the drilling rig was Oil Production Maintenance Co., Inc. (O.P.M.). The appellant filed a products liability lawsuit against the appellee rigging company, Rig-A-Lite, Inc., which specialized in manufacturing electrical systems, including junction boxes for oil rigs. A jury found in favor of the appellant, identifying the negligent failure of the appellee to insulate a junction box as the sole proximate cause of the explosion, resulting in a verdict for over $500,000 in damages.

However, the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the appellee, challenging the jury's findings. The appellant sought a review asserting that the evidence supported the jury's decision, while the appellee contended that the jury's answers were contrary to the evidence's weight and preponderance, rendering them manifestly unjust. Evidence showed that the appellee contributed to the rig's electrical system, neglecting to insulate a junction box properly, this led to the box accumulating moisture and defectively insulated wiring, which charged metal rig components with electric potential.

Further thorough testimony revealed that repair and replacement of junction boxes were typical, and expert witnesses linked the poor insulation to the electrocution and the triggering of the perforating gun. The trial court ordered a reversal and remand, instructing that juror misconduct be reviewed before entry of the judgment for the appellant as per the jury's verdict.","Upon reviewing the procedural posture and the detailed evidence presented in the case, it's apparent that the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred by rendering judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The appellate court will point out that the jury's decision was backed by sufficient evidence, illustrating that the appellee indeed failed to ensure proper insulation of the junction box, which is a product manufactured and sold by appellee to be used in rigging operations conducive to high risks of injury if not carefully made. The defect in the junction box was linked directly to the injuries suffered by the appellant.

The court will assess the foreseeability of harm as a critical element in establishing a connection between the product's defect and the resultant damages, abiding by standards such as those set forth by the Restatement, Torts, § 395. The reasonably foreseeable risk of bodily harm exacerbates the manufacturer's liability due to negligent craftsmanship given the dangerous environment where the product is employed.

The evidence presented and confirmed by multiple witnesses will suggest that the improperly insulated junction box delivered by the appellee was likely the same box involved in the accident, given indicators such as the condition of the insulation tape and the purchasing history of new boxes within the time frame leading up to the incident.

Taking into consideration the appellant's significant injuries, his personal and financial hardships, the future impact on his life, and given that no other act of negligence has been identified, the court will find the amount of damages determined by the jury appropriate to the severity of the case. The court will observe that the verdict was reached through careful deliberation of the evidence without extrinsic influences.

The appellate court will direct the lower court to enter judgment in favor of the appellant in alignment with the jury verdict, also considering the due process for evaluating appellee's claims of juror misconduct, which must be substantiated through proper court procedures under Rule 324, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The reversal of the judgment, notwithstanding the verdict, indicates that the appellate court predicts the lower court should uphold the jury's decision and grant the appellant the awarded damages based on the veritable link between appellee's negligence and the appellant's injuries."
"The beneficiaries, as appellees, initially filed an action against the insurer, the defendant, to recover on a policy of insurance issued to the insured, Edward MacKechnie. The policy stipulated coverage against bodily injuries from accidents and payment of a sum in case of such injuries resulting in death or permanent paralysis. MacKechnie suffered injuries and eventual death following an accident involving a fall while attempting to board a streetcar. The insurer contended that MacKechnie had signed a release and accepted a settlement under the policy, therefore nullifying the insurer's liability. However, the trial court found that MacKechnie did not have sufficient mental capacity to understand the release when he signed it, rendering the release invalid.

The insurer also raised procedural complaints regarding the beneficiaries' counsel's opening argument, which the insurer claimed went beyond the evidence and had the potential to inflame the jury against them. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the beneficiaries for the sum of $13,781.92, which included principal, interest, and attorney's fees, and ruled that Stewart MacKechnie, another plaintiff, would take nothing. The insurer appealed the decision, arguing both against the validity of the award to the beneficiaries and the conduct of their counsel during the trial.","The court will reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the action for further proceedings. The appellate court will likely find that the evidence presented did indeed show that the insured, Edward MacKechnie, had suffered from an accident that led to his injuries and eventual death, and that these injuries, independent of all other causes, had continuously and wholly disabled him. However, the issue will be whether he had sufficient mental capacity to understand and enter into the settlement agreement when he signed the release for the insurer. Since the trial court concluded that he did not, the prediction is that the appellate court will uphold this aspect.

Nonetheless, the appellate court will find issues with the trial procedure, specifically the submission of special issues to the jury that combined multiple separate factual questions which should have been submitted separately, and hence, leading to potential confusion and an unfair verdict. Additionally, the appellate court will likely find that the opening argument of the beneficiaries' counsel exceeded the bounds of legitimate argument, potentially resulting in prejudice against the insurer. This inappropriate conduct, including personal criticism of opposing counsel, and remarks meant to elicit sympathy for the plaintiff's position, if not corrected promptly by the trial court, would be grounds for a reversal of the decision. The counsel's argument was not based on evidence and improperly influenced the jury, therefore the appellate court will consider this to have potentially obscured the real issues at hand. On these grounds, particularly regarding trial procedure and conduct during argument, the appellate decision will be to reverse the lower court's judgment and remand for a new trial to ensure fair consideration of the facts and proper jury deliberation free from potential prejudice and confusion."
"- Appellant (live-in companion) initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against appellee (physician), stemming from medical care provided to the decedent.
- The case involved a claim that the physician's negligence led to the decedent's death.
- The trial court awarded an instructed verdict in favor of the physician, effectively dismissing the case before it went to a jury.
- Appellant lived with decedent from 1970 until her death in 1979 and supported her financially after she stopped working.
- Appellant asserted a common law marriage with the decedent, which was essential for standing to bring the wrongful death claim.
- Appellant claimed that they held themselves out as married to the public, with evidence including their cohabitation, public references to being married, insurance policy naming appellant as ""husband,"" and appellant being recognized as the decedent's husband in the medical records and by hospital staff.
- Medical expert Dr. Peter Rosen testified that the decedent's cardiac arrest, which led to her death, could have been prevented with timely and proper medical care. The decedent's rapidly declining condition should have been foreseeable to a competent physician.
- The jury was not given an opportunity to assess damages due to the instructed verdict but would have had to consider loss of consortium, society, companionship, and mental anguish if the case had continued.
- The case also included an allegation of gross negligence, with appellant's theory being that the decedent was refused care due to inability to pay, which would constitute conscious indifference to her welfare.","- The appellate court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.
- It held that the evidence presented was adequate to create a fact issue regarding the common law marriage between appellant and decedent, which needed to be decided by a jury.
- The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to establish a fact issue on negligence and proximate cause linking the physician's actions to the decedent's death.
- Dr. Rosen's expert testimony would allow a jury to reasonably find that the cardiac arrest could have been prevented, meeting the elements of cause in fact and foreseeability inherent in proximate cause.
- As for damages, the court contended that based on appellant's account of their relationship and cohabitation, a jury could have found non-pecuniary damages for loss of companionship and mental anguish.
- The court agreed that there was enough evidence of gross negligence due to the decedent being allegedly denied treatment because of payment issues, constituting conscious indifference.
- In conclusion, the appellate court found that the case was prematurely concluded without considering all relevant evidence, and therefore a new trial was warranted to enable a jury to weigh the evidence and decide on the claims."
"Jessie Rogers and Robert Lofton, two individuals who suffered from asbestos-related illnesses, along with their wives (Eleanor Rogers and Jo Emma Lofton), filed two consolidated cases against Keene Corporation, a manufacturer of asbestos-containing products. Rogers, a former boilermaker and insulator helper, was diagnosed with asbestosis, while Lofton, a former longshoreman, had mesothelioma, both due to occupational exposure to asbestos products, including those made by Keene. The plaintiffs alleged their ailments resulted from occupational exposure, seeking compensation for loss of consortium and other damages. During the trial, all defendants except Keene settled with the plaintiffs. 

The trial was presided over by Judge Joe Brown, whose son-in-law, Andy Waters, became an associate at Baron & Budd, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, during the course of the trial. Keene Corporation filed a motion for Judge Brown to recuse himself on this basis, which the trial court denied. This denial was confirmed by the Presiding Judge of the First Administrative Judicial District. Keene's motion centered on concerns about the impartiality of the judge due to his familial connection to an employee of the plaintiffs’ legal firm.

The trial resulted in judgments for five plaintiffs, but Keene only appealed the judgment for the Rogerses and the Loftons. They were awarded a combined $1.8 million in damages; after offsets for settlements with other defendants, the combined sum was $780,700. 

Keene raised several points of error on appeal. These focused on the recusal issue, the exclusion of ""frequency, regularity, and proximity"" from the term ""exposure"" in the jury charge, the exclusion of foreseeability from the definition of proximate cause, definition of ""unreasonably dangerous,"" and procedural errors including the admission of hearsay and unauthenticated expert testimony. Specifically, Keene took issue with admitting a video deposition of Dr. Joseph Wagoner, an epidemiologist, along with two reports allegedly written by him, questioning the authenticity and evidential basis. The appellants’ firm counsel contended that the video deposition was hearsay and not properly authenticated, claiming it had been wrongfully admitted into evidence.","The appellate court upheld the trial court's decision, ruling against Keene Corporation’s contentions. It found no abuse of discretion regarding the recusal of Judge Brown, based on the lack of evidence that his son-in-law, being a salaried employee who is not tied financially to the case's outcome, was substantially affected by the trial's outcome or that the judge’s impartiality could reasonably be questioned. The court also ruled that the term ""exposure"" did not require explicit definition linking it to causation, as jury questions were adequate in addressing causation later in the charge. 

The verdict reaffirmed the jury's instructions which excluded foreseeability from proximate cause, in alignment with Alabama law, which applied to the case, and upheld the term ""unreasonably dangerous"" as defined for the ordinary consumer and determined the trial court did not err in these respects.

Errors recognized by the court regarding the admission of Dr. Wagoner's video deposition and reports were deemed harmless as evidence was deemed cumulative of a large body of other evidence that was properly admitted. The appellate court emphasized that such erroneous admission was not calculated to cause the rendition of an improper judgment.

Consequently, Keene’s appeal of the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was not successful and the decision was affirmed, maintaining the award for damages to the Rogerses and the Loftons. Keene could only have prevailed on the appeal if the court had found the alleged errors to have been harmful rather than harmless."
"Orville Berg worked for AMF Tuboscope, Canada—situated in Alberta, Canada—which is a subsidiary of AMF Tuboscope, Inc., based in Houston, Texas. During his employment spanning eleven years, Berg cleaned and coated pipes by sandblasting and spraying a coating mixture manufactured by Tuboscope in Houston and shipped to Canada. Berg developed several medical conditions, such as occupational lung asthma, pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chemical sensitization due to exposure to chemicals and dust. The Canadian Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) provided Berg with benefits from 1974, and he continued to receive them until at least October 1998. The Bergs filed a lawsuit against the appellees (AMF Inc. and others) in Harris County, Texas. However, the trial court dismissed the case on the grounds of forum non conveniens, a doctrine allowing courts to decline jurisdiction if it is significantly inconvenient and a more appropriate forum exists elsewhere. This dismissal decision was based on the principle that Berg had an adequate remedy under Canadian law, the majority of evidence and witnesses were Canadian, and a direct view of the plant where Berg was exposed would be imperative. The appellants had argued that the appellees' act or omission occurred in Houston, Texas, and that the appellees failed to satisfy the statutory factors of forum non conveniens under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, section 71.051. However, the trial court found that appellees met the burden of proof in demonstrating that Canada was the more appropriate forum.","The judgment was affirmed, indicating that the dismissal was correctly applied. Even though some documents and evidence related to the manufacture of the chemicals were in Texas, the place of exposure and most witnesses were in Canada. The remedy available under Canadian law was considered adequate, and there was significant emphasis on the benefit of having the trial closer to the location of the plant for the practicality of viewing its condition. The appellee’s motion to dismiss succeeded on the grounds that they had sufficiently demonstrated by preponderance of the evidence that each of the necessary elements for forum non conveniens applied. These elements included the existence of an alternative forum (Canada), where the Bergs could try their claim; an adequate remedy available in Canada; and considerations of private and public interests favoring the Canadian forum due to the location of witnesses, evidence, and application of Canadian law. Additionally, maintaining the suit in Texas would cause a substantial injustice to the appellees due to the location of evidence and the related costs. The appellants’ argument that an exception to the dismissal under section 71.051(f) should apply because the injury was caused by an act or omission in Texas did not hold since they failed to provide credible evidence establishing a causal nexus between the appellee's conduct in Texas and Berg’s injury in Canada. Without verified evidence relating the Texas-manufactured chemicals to the injuries sustained by Berg, the appellants did not meet the burden under section 71.051(f) to prevent dismissal."
"The case revolves around an accident where a victim, a female dairy farm owner, was struck by a freight train operated by the defendant railway company, St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company of Texas, near a public highway crossing at Winona, Texas. The victim was attempting to drive her cattle across the track at the time of the incident. The victim sued the railway company for damages, claiming that the company's negligence led to the accident. The allegations included that the crossing was extra-hazardous, the company failed to install a ""wig-wag"" signal device, failed to sound the whistle and bell, did not maintain a proper lookout, and operated the train at a high, rapid, and dangerous speed.

The railway company argued that the victim was guilty of contributory negligence both before and after noticing the approaching train. The incident occurred on the morning of April 21, 1939, when the victim was driving her four cows across the tracks; she noticed the train when it was 420 to 450 feet away. Believing her cow was in danger, she attempted a rescue, which resulted in the accident.

The jury ruled in favor of the victim, finding the train's speed to be negligent and a proximate cause of the injuries. They disagreed that the absence of a whistle, bell, proper lookout, or wig-wag signal were proximate causes. The issues of whether the victim's fright and apprehension for her cow led her to the position of danger and whether she exercised ordinary care for her safety were all answered affirmatively. The victim claimed she was scared, lost her head at the moment of the train's approach, and was trying to save her cow that was on the track.

The railway company contended that the victim was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, that her actions were the sole proximate cause of her injuries, and that the speed of the train was not a proximate cause of any fright or apprehension.

The victim, as part of her defense, argued that the company knew the crossing was regularly used by her and others to drive cattle and should have anticipated the operation of the train at high speeds creating danger. The legal principle at stake was whether the rule that exonerates someone from contributory negligence in an attempt to rescue a person from peril should also apply to the rescue of property.","The appellate court will conclude that the victim acted with contributory negligence by leaving a place of safety to rescue her cow. The court will reason that while there is a legal precedent for a person being exonerated from contributory negligence when attempting to rescue another person from peril, this rule has not been extended in Texas, nor in any provided case law, to include the rescue of imperiled property.

The court will refer to previous cases supporting the principle that voluntarily entering a place of danger to rescue property constitutes contributory negligence. Furthermore, the court will differentiate between the impulse to save human life, which may mitigate contributory negligence, and the impulse to save property, which does not.

The court's decision will reverse and remand the lower court's judgment based on this legal distinction, ignoring the jury's findings that the victim acted in fright and exercised ordinary care for her safety up until the point of becoming frightened. They will dismiss arguments related to the train's speed, whistle, bell, lookout, and wig-wag signal, as they will view the victim's contributory negligence as the sole proximate cause of her injuries.

The appellate court will find that the victim's decision to risk danger for the cow was negligent as a matter of law, rendering irrelevant any negligence on the part of the railway company. As such, the judgment in favor of the railway company will be reversed and rendered, and there will be no need for further discussion on the other issues the defendant raised."
"The insurance company issued a health and disability policy to an insured individual, which stipulated that any disability resulting from heart trouble would only be covered if the disease originated more than six months after the date of the policy. The insured became ill and was bedridden, and a physician initially diagnosed him with heart disease. However, the physician later found blood in the patient's chest fluid and diagnosed inoperable bronchus and lung cancer. The insured passed away, and the insurance company denied liability, claiming that the individual had contracted heart disease within six months of the issuance of the policy. The trial court granted the beneficiary's motion for a directed verdict because cancer, not heart disease, was the proximate cause of the disability, and the court held that the insurance company had waived the 10-day notice of proof provision by denying liability on the policy.

The insurance company appealed based on three points: (1) the evidence established that the insured suffered from heart trouble and disability resulting partly from that, which was excluded by the policy, (2) no written notice of the insured's disability was given within ten days of its beginning, and no medical reports were furnished at intervals of thirty days as required, and (3) insufficient evidence to prove that the assured's cancer and resulting disability did not originate within 30 days of the date of the policy.

The non-medical evidence presented showed that the insured had been in good health and regularly employed before becoming disabled on or about October 15, 1945. He had no visible ailments or recent doctor visits. After becoming ill, the physician initially treated the insured for heart disease but later diagnosed him with cancer. Despite heart troubles, the medical testimony established that the insured could have returned to work were it not for the cancer. The insurance company denied the claim on the basis that the insured had heart trouble that should have excluded him from coverage, but did not raise concerns about the late notice or incomplete medical reports in their denial.","Considering the insurance company's decision to base their denial of the claim solely on the assertion that the disability was caused by heart trouble excluded by the policy, it's predictable that the court will find this constitutes a waiver of other defenses, such as the late notice and incomplete medical reports. The denial letter, focusing on the heart condition and refunding premiums, suggests that technical compliance with the notice and report requirements was no longer an issue for the company. Thus, the court will likely reject the insurance company's appeal concerning the lack of proper notice and medical reports, as it will be seen as having waived these defenses by not raising them at the time of denial.

As for the evidence concerning the origination of the insured's cancer, the beneficiary provided testimony from relatives indicating the insured was in good health before October 15, 1945, and that he appeared healthy when the policy was issued. Although the insured's heart condition was chronic, it did not disable him until it became aggravated by cancer. The medical expert testified that the cancer independently caused the total disability insured against. Considering this, the court will likely overrule the insurance company's third point, as the evidence sufficiently supports the finding that the cancer and resultant disability did not originate within 30 days of the policy's start date.

Given the totality of the evidence, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, concluding that cancer was the proximate cause of the insured's disability, not the pre-existing heart condition, and that the beneficiary met the burden of proof to show the disability claim was justified under the terms of the policy."
"This case concerns a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, AutoZone Parts, Inc. (AutoZone), against the plaintiffs, Dorothy Sands, individually and as a representative of the estate of Cecilia Stanford (deceased), and Julie Stanford. The plaintiffs brought claims of negligent undertaking and gross negligence against AutoZone, arising from an incident on October 23, 2017, involving Cecilia Stanford.

AutoZone is an automotive parts and accessories retailer that provides a complimentary diagnostic service, advertised as ""Fix Finder"", to help customers understand the reasons behind their vehicle's check engine light. The service includes a diagnostic test using an electronic scanner that communicates with the vehicle's onboard computer, comparing results against a database of repair solutions and generating a free report. If an identifiable repair cannot be made at AutoZone, the policy is to refer customers to a qualified mechanic.

Cecilia Stanford visited AutoZone when her check-engine light came on. After the diagnostic test, she was given a report indicating trouble code ""P1751,"" which suggested a fault in the automatic transmission control relay circuit. There was no recommendation for specific repair parts or actions. Stanford called her sister, Kara, and discussed the issue described, including that an AutoZone employee reportedly told her it was okay to drive the vehicle home. Stanford intended to visit a mechanic post-work, and Kara offered her a ride home from the shop.

On her commute to work, Stanford's vehicle stalled on the road. Despite warnings from her sister not to leave the safety of her vehicle, Stanford attempted to push her car out of the traffic lane, during which she was fatally struck from behind by motorist Dacota Deaver. Deaver admitted that his inattention to the road likely contributed to the accident. Sands subsequently filed wrongful death and survival claims against AutoZone, alleging reliance on AutoZone's implied assurance of vehicle safety directly placed Stanford in her fatal situation.

AutoZone sought a combined no-evidence and traditional motion for summary judgment, contending there was no evidence that AutoZone's actions proximately caused Stanford's injuries and death. The trial court granted the motion without specific comments, leading to Sands's appeal.","The trial court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of AutoZone will be upheld. The central argument for the defense would be that no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the proximate cause, and specifically the first element of cause-in-fact. It would be argued that any alleged negligence by AutoZone in advising Stanford on the condition of her vehicle is too remote to have materially contributed to the fatal incident. Cause-in-fact requires that the defendant's actions were a substantial factor in causing the injury and that the injury would not have occurred but for those actions. In this case, Deaver's admission of not maintaining a proper lookout is likely to be portrayed as the active and efficient cause of the accident. As such, AutoZone's alleged negligence would materialize as merely a condition for the injury rather than its direct cause, making the connection to the fatal outcome too attenuated to support legal causation.

Furthermore, since successful negligent undertaking and gross negligence claims require evidence of proximate cause, the failure of the negligent undertaking claim inherently dictates the failure of the gross negligence claim. By this reasoning, there would be consensus that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to produce evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact about the challenged elements of their claims. Thus, AutoZone's no-evidence motion for summary judgment on these claims was appropriately granted, and the trial court's ruling will be confirmed."
"Hicham Watanabe was injured in an assault that occurred in a parking lot in the early hours after his work as a valet manager at Nox nightclub in Houston, Texas. He was hoping to deescalate a heated verbal confrontation between a parking attendant, Samsung, and four angry men. The men were agitated because their cars had been broken into while parked in one of the two parking lots owned by Summit Path Partners, LLC but operated by Hocine Aitmohand. Watanabe crossed the street to assist and ended up following the men to see the damage to their vehicles, where he was punched in the eye by one of the men, later identified as Terrance Williams, which resulted in significant injuries.

Watanabe filed a lawsuit against various parties including the property owner (Summit Path Partners, LLC), the parking lot lessee (Hocine Aitmohand), and his employers (A.J. Ahmed and Edward Hua), alleging negligence and premises liability for failing to provide adequate lighting and security which contributed to his injuries. Watanabe's assault claims were based on the assertion that the defendants should have anticipated the criminal conduct due to the high rate of violent crime in the area. The trial court granted take-nothing summary judgment in favor of all defendants, dismissing Watanabe's claims, and Watanabe appealed.","The appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's judgment for several reasons predicted based on the detailed backgrounds:

1. Summit Path may not owe a duty to Watanabe as they might argue that they were not in possession of the premises at the time of the assault (since the property was leased to Aitmohand) and could also assert that they had no duty to protect Watanabe from Williams's criminal act, assuming that such an act was not foreseeable to them. Any duty of Summit Path would hinge upon their control of the premises, the foreseeability of the criminal activity, and Watanabe's status – whether he was an invitee, licensee, or trespasser.

2. Watanabe's voluntary involvement to deescalate a dangerous situation may classify him as an implied licensee. Given he knew the risks involved (was aware of the alteration, perceived the possibility of a physical altercation, and acknowledged the area was dark), Summit Path had no duty to warn him or make safe the dangerous condition of which he was already aware. 

3. As for Ahmed and Hua, they may argue successfully they did not owe Watanabe a duty of care as they neither owned nor controlled the premises where the assault occurred. Additionally, as they operated Nox as EA-BBC, LLC, they may assert that any claims against them personally are inappropriate, and they could raise the affirmative defense of limitations against EA-BBC, LLC.

4. Aitmohand may claim that there is no evidence of duty or proximate cause linking him to Watanabe's injuries. Since Watanabe failed to present evidence in response to Aitmohand's no-evidence motion for summary judgment, as required under Rule 166a(i), the court could affirm the summary judgment in favor of Aitmohand.

A prediction of the outcome will consider the evidence on record and the legal principles of premises liability, duty based on the plaintiff's status, and the control of the premises to determine whether the trial court's judgments were appropriate. The verdict in favor of the defendants will likely be affirmed based on the points raised."
"Appellant mother, Joyce Wilson, filed a wrongful death and survival action against appellee psychiatrist, Dr. Ricque Brister, following the suicide of her daughter, Erin Carr. Dr. Brister treated Carr for depression on October 29, 1991, which was the sole treatment session that Carr had with Dr. Brister. Two weeks post-treatment, on November 15, 1991, Carr committed suicide by shooting herself with a gun and bullets provided to her by a friend, Ryan Weigand. Wilson alleged in her lawsuit that Dr. Brister did not exercise the degree of care an ordinary and prudent physician would have and that his negligence was a proximate cause of Carr's death. The alleged negligence included failure to diagnose, care for, and treat Carr's depression adequately; failing to perform a proper psychiatric assessment; not taking appropriate measures following assessment; not questioning Carr sufficiently about her suicide ideation; not involving experts in suicide behavior management; not hospitalizing Carr for suicidal ideations, psychiatric observation, or clinical depression.

Dr. Brister filed a motion for summary judgment, making the argument that he could not be held responsible for Carr's death due to the intervening criminal act of her friend, which he claimed was unforeseeable and thus absolved him of liability. Supporting his motion, Dr. Brister provided deposition excerpts that did not indicate Carr's mention of a gun or Weigand, nor the possibility that anyone might assist her in committing suicide. Dr. Brister also referenced pleadings from a previously settled negligence suit filed by Wilson against Weigand and his father, which indicated that Weigand had pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Carr's suicide in juvenile court. 

Wilson responded by arguing that proximate cause is a matter for the jury, that Weigand's actions did not absolve Dr. Brister of liability, and raised a fact issue on whether Dr. Brister's negligence was a proximate cause of Carr's death. Wilson offered excerpts from Dr. Brister's deposition stating the importance of hospitalizing someone with suicidal ideations, acknowledged Carr's risk factors, and specified that he would have hospitalized her if she was imminently suicidal, which he denied.","It appears the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for Dr. Brister will be reversed. The reasoning will likely be that the appellant mother has successfully raised a factual issue relating to the element of proximate cause in her daughter's death. Although Dr. Brister introduced evidence pointing to Weigand's intervening act as a superseding cause, this does not conclusively establish that his negligence was not also a concurrent cause contributing to Carr's death. The standard applied will maintain that proximate cause includes both the actual cause and foreseeability. The summary judgment evidence of an intervening cause does not conclusively prove that Dr. Brister's acts were not a contributing concurrent cause.

The future verdict will probably focus on the principles of concurrent causation and the foreseeability of the suicide as key issues. The argument will likely emphasize that Dr. Brister, as a psychiatrist treating a patient with known depression and suicidal ideation, should have foreseen the general risk of suicide irrespective of the intervention of a third person. It will be maintained that even if the friend's criminal act was unforeseen, it could still be a concurrent cause if the psychiatrist's alleged negligence has set in motion an unbroken chain leading to Carr's suicide.

The court will probably disregard the argument that Dr. Brister's negligence was excused by Weigand's criminal act, as foreseeability does not require anticipation of the precise events, only that the defendant could have reasonably expected the type of event that occurred. The notion that negligence of one party can be mitigated by the negligence of another will be rejected unless it is proven conclusively that no concurrent causation existed, which the court will find Dr. Brister failed to do. Thus, the trial court's decision to grant a take-nothing summary judgment will likely be overcome by the appellant's evidence suggesting the possibility that Dr. Brister could have anticipated the general danger Carr was in and might have done more to prevent her suicide."
"The appellant, a telephone company, was engaged in a legal dispute with an appellee, a telephone company customer, following an incident where the customer's wife was struck by lightning. The incident occurred in the presence of a storm, where lightning flashed in a room, striking the customer's wife who was found unconscious with burns on her body near the telephone. The telephone was nonfunctional post-incident, indicating the lightning may have traveled through the telephone wires. The appellee's family rushed to get medical help using a neighbor's telephone since their own was incapacitated.

The central issue of the case rested upon the telephone company's alleged negligence in failing to install a ""ground-connection"" on the telephone's arrester device. It was contended that the absence of a ground wire permitted lightning to enter the customer's house through the telephone wires, causing injury. During the trial, the jury, after considering evidence, concluded that the lack of a grounding connection constituted negligence by the telephone company and that a ground wire was ordinarily installed by telephone companies when setting up a residence connection.

The company had admitted to the absence of a ground-connection at the customer's residence but appealed the case, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict. The arguments encompassed the unpredictability of electricity’s behavior, the actual cause of the wife's injuries, the expert testimony regarding the movement of electric currents, and the possibility of the injuries not being the proximate result of the telephone company's negligence.

The telephone company also disputed the admissibility of certain testimony, particularly from witnesses lacking credentials as experts in electricity, and from an exchange with a telephone operator after the accident, whose remarks were argued to be outside the scope of their knowledge and duties.

Other pillars of dissent included the contention that the claims regarding the wife's injuries, including an allegation of a diminution in her hearing, were insufficiently pleaded, hence testimony on that matter was inadmissible. These legal arguments were contrasted with observations suggesting that certain aspects of the accident’s repercussions, such as the damage sustained by the telephone equipment, the lightning's points of contact, and the physical manifestation of injuries, supported the appellee's position.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The verdict will be sustained based on the reasonableness of the jury's findings regarding the telephone company's negligence in not installing a ground wire, which is typically provided to prevent the kind of accident that occurred. Despite the telephone company’s assertions to the contrary, the evidence presented, including physical facts, will be considered sufficiently convincing and consistent with the jury’s conclusions.

The court will address the sufficiency of the evidence by highlighting that the expert testimonies and the inconclusive nature of electric behavior do not decisively counter evidence showing the direct connection between the lack of a ground wire and the injury sustained. Testimonies contradicting the impact and permanence of the wife's injuries will be deemed as challenged by her own accounts and corroborating evidence demonstrating her substantial suffering and the serious after-effects of the shock, which can reasonably include impaired hearing.

The court will dismiss objections to witness qualifications as matters of discretion for the trial judge, who did not appear to abuse such discretion in this case. Testimony from the telephone operator will be admitted as part of the immediate aftermath, serving as a relevant account of the telephone line’s condition during the accident, which is likely to have been within his professional purview.

Additionally, any concerns regarding the inclusion of the wife's hearing loss in the damages will be set aside, as the court will interpret the general claims of 'serious, painful and permanent bodily injuries' sufficiently broad to encompass unlisted specific injuries, or deem the testimony permissible to rebut claims against the severity or existence of the injuries.

In conclusion, the court will reject the telephone company’s challenge which centers on the theory that the lightning arrester's design and functionality, exclusive of a ground wire, would preempt liability. This position will be considered to overlook critical evidence that highlights the ground wire's role in the device’s effectiveness in preventing electrical injury.

Therefore, the affirmation of the trial court's decision will endorse the jury's findings that the lack of a proper ground wire was indeed negligent, that such negligence was a cause of the wife's injuries, and that a ground wire could have functionally mitigated the electrical current, thus preventing harm. The company's writ of error will be refused, finalizing the decision in favor of the appellee."
"Defendant government mental health institute, Dallas County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center (Dallas County MHMR), and its staff were involved in a wrongful death suit brought by plaintiff parents following the death of their son, Roger Bossley. Bossley had been involuntarily committed to Parkland Memorial Hospital after a suicide attempt and later transferred to Hillside Center, a facility operated by Dallas County MHMR.

While Bossley showed signs of initial recovery, an incident involving a rehabilitation counselor left him despondent, expressing a desire to obtain a gun for the purpose of suicide upon his release. This concern was reported to treating physicians and noted as a definite risk. A decision was made to transfer Bossley to Parkland Memorial Hospital for further evaluation in a more restrictive environment. Despite measures such as locking the main door, an inner self-locking glass door remained open. As staff technician Angela Jones was leaving for lunch, she inadvertently allowed Bossley the chance to push her aside and escape the facility due to the unlocked doors. Bossley was then pursued by Hillside staff and police, eventually running into highway traffic and being killed by a truck.

The plaintiffs, Roger's parents Albert and Elaine Bossley, claimed that their son's death was directly linked to the staff's failure to secure the environment properly, particularly with regards to the unlocked doors. They argued that the wrongful death was ""proximately caused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property,"" invoking the Texas Tort Claims Act, which contains provisions for waiving governmental immunity for property-related injuries or death.

The trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor of the defendants, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas.","The court will reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas and render a judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing. The reasoning for this outcome will center on the interpretation of the Tort Claims Act, which waives governmental immunity not in a broad sense but in limited situations where the government would be held liable as if it were a private person. It will be understood that while the unlocked doors played a role in the sequence of events that led to Roger's death, the doors themselves cannot be regarded as the proximate cause of his suicide. Rather, they merely provided the condition that made the escape possible. The plaintiff’s core complaint will be interpreted as being against the failure of the staff to restrain Bossley knowing his condition, which is not a grounds for waiver of immunity under the Act.

The scope of the decision will also include immunity for individual staff members under Section 101.106 of the Act, as the claim against these individuals involves the same subject matter as the claim against the governmental unit, and the unit's immunity extends to the employees. The court will dismiss the plaintiff's arguments against this point by establishing that all individual defendants are entitled to the same immunity, regardless of the specific actions of each individual. Finally, it will be noted that the precedential cases cited by the plaintiffs, Lowe v. Texas Tech University and Robinson v. Central Texas MHMR Center, are limited to instances where provided property lacked integral safety components leading to injury, not applicable in this case as Hillside, did not lack an integral safety component due to being unlocked in compliance with its policy."
"James Bailey, a deceased employee, was exposed to asbestos while working at Mobil's Beaumont, Texas, facilities intermittently between 1966 and 1972. His family and the administratrix of his estate brought a wrongful death action against Mobil, alleging that his lung cancer was caused by asbestos exposure on the employer's premises. The jury found in favor of the Bailey family, awarding $350,000 in actual damages and $500,000 in exemplary damages due to malice. Mobil challenged the verdict, claiming there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of causation, arguing that Bailey's heavy smoking history was the true cause of his lung cancer.

James Bailey had a long history of smoking, consuming a pack of cigarettes per day for the last forty to fifty years of his life. There was no medical evidence indicating typical signs of asbestos exposure, such as asbestos bodies in his lungs or scarring of lung tissues. During the trial, the central issue was the medical causation of Bailey's lung cancer, and whether it was caused by asbestos exposure at Mobil's facilities or by Bailey's history of heavy smoking. The Bailey family presented two medical causation experts, Dr. Gary Friedman and Dr. Richard Lemen, who testified about the increased risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure and its synergistic effect with smoking. The family's theory was based on the severe asbestos exposure at Mobil, whereas Mobil's theory pointed solely to Bailey's heavy smoking.

Mobil's appeal raised issues concerning the admissibility of the plaintiff expert's testimony on medical causation and the lack of ""legally sufficient evidence"" to support the jury's finding. The appeal considered the standards set forth in prior cases such as E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. Robinson, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, and City of Keller v. Wilson in determining the admissibility of scientific expert testimony. The reliability of scientific evidence in toxic tort cases was also a key consideration, as outlined in the Havner decision, particularly around epidemiological studies used to prove causation.","The appellate court will likely find the judgment in favor of the Baileys legally insufficient due to the unreliability of the expert testimony provided. Under the precedents set by previous Texas Supreme Court decisions, the court will require that the scientific evidence presented had a reliable foundation and was relevant to the case. The court will look for scientifically reliable evidence that specifically attributes the cause of the lung cancer to asbestos exposure, which must be more than speculation or subjective belief.

The causation experts for the Baileys are expected to fail in meeting these requirements because their testimony did not sufficiently negate the plausible alternate cause of Bailey’s lung cancer: his heavy smoking history. Moreover, the Baileys' experts will be discredited for relying on medical literature and studies that have not achieved general acceptance within the scientific community and lacked the necessary detailed methodology and validation.

Despite the findings that asbestos can cause lung cancer and the typically higher risk in smokers also exposed to asbestos, the lack of direct signs of asbestos-related lung damage in Bailey, as well as the conflicting epidemiological evidence presented, will result in the conclusion that the Baileys have failed to exclude other plausible causes ""with reasonable certainty."" Therefore, the verdict will be reversed, and judgment rendered in favor of Mobil Oil Corporation, with the appellate court finding no legally sufficient evidence of medical causation to support the jury's original verdict."
"This case revolves around a three-way vehicular collision that occurred on Highway 87 near Big Spring. The collision involved an automobile driven by Glenn Mayes, a pickup truck driven by Willie Walker, and a Western Cotton Oil Company truck, herein referred to as Western. Mayes asserted that while he was driving south behind the Western truck, the truck suddenly turned east across the center line, leading to a collision with Walker's northbound pickup. The impact from the collision with Western caused Walker's pickup to veer into Mayes's vehicle, resulting in damages. Mayes sued Western and Walker, alleging that Western's negligence was the proximate cause of the collision due to various failures in lookout, signaling, and control of the vehicle, as well as a violation of traffic laws. 

Western's defense claimed that its driver had to swerve to avoid a head-on collision with Walker's pickup, which had been improperly driven on the left side of the road. Western alleged that Walker's negligence, particularly his intoxication and impaired driving as a result of consuming alcohol, was the sole proximate cause of the collision. Besides, Western contended it acted appropriately under the circumstances. Walker also sued Western for damages, rejecting Mayes' allegations and saying that the damage to Mayes's vehicle was caused solely by Western's negligence. Walker's claim against Western mirrored many of the allegations made by Mayes.

The jury found Western's driver to have been negligent by turning the truck across the highway and concluded that this negligence was a proximate cause of the collision involving all three vehicles. Walker was awarded compensation for personal injuries and the diminished value of his pickup. The trial court, based on these jury findings, ruled in favor of Mayes and Walker. Western appealed, arguing that Walker should not have been allowed to testify as to the market value of his pickup without being an automobile dealer, the jury instructions were flawed in rejecting Western's issues about Walker's alleged intoxication, and that the verdict was improperly calculated by the jury.","The court will affirm the trial court’s decision, rejecting each of Western's arguments. It is likely to reason that Walker, despite not being an automobile dealer, adequately demonstrated familiarity with the market value of his pickup, thus legitimizing his valuation testimony. Furthermore, the court will determine that the intoxication issue did not represent ultimate issues of fact, acknowledging that evidence of intoxication is just one factor to be considered in assessing negligence and proximate cause. Thus, it was not a mistake for the trial court to deny the submission of these issues to the jury.

Regarding the damages awarded to Walker, the court will likely find that the jury's method of arriving at the sum—initially adding individual juror assessments and dividing by twelve—was simply a preliminary step in deliberations. They will likely conclude that this initial calculation did not bind the jury to the final amount decided upon, which was determined through proper deliberation after using the initial figure as a starting point.

In short, the court will affirm the decision in favor of Mayes and Walker, finding no reversible error in the trial procedures or the jury's determination of the award for damages."
"The plaintiffs, N. S. Benavides and his wife Ann Benavides, visited the store of defendant J. Weingarten, Inc., a nursery, to purchase shrubbery and flowers. During their visit, a 50-lb. bag of fertilizer was placed on a large wheelbarrow by an employee of the nursery and followed the couple to the cashier. As Mrs. Benavides completed her payment, the wheelbarrow turned over, striking her on the calf of her left leg with such force that it knocked her down, pinned her to the floor, and caused severe bruising to her left leg and buttock. The injury was serious enough that it required 19 visits to the doctor, surgery to drain a developed blood clot, and the insertion of a drain tube in her leg. Mrs. Benavides was unable to work for five weeks and experienced significant pain, which continued up to the trial. At that time, her left leg remained swollen, and the wound area was still discolored.

The trial was to a jury, which found an employee of J. Weingarten, Inc. negligently placed the wheelbarrow behind Mrs. Benavides and that this was a proximate cause of her injuries. The jury dismissed claims that a child was involved in causing the wheelbarrow to turn over or that the accident was unavoidable, and awarded the plaintiffs $8,000 in damages.

The nursery's defense was based on the argument that a small child overturned the wheelbarrow, and this act was considered a new and independent cause for which the defendant could not be held liable. The nursery appealed, but the only witness who testified about the child turning over the wheelbarrow was the cashier. Her testimony was not enough to convince the jury. Moreover, the jury rejected the theory that the child's actions were a new and independent cause unrelated to the nursery's negligence.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiffs. Despite the nursery's contention that a child's actions had caused the wheelbarrow to tip over, the court will hold that the child's act, if it occurred, was a concurring act of negligence closely related to the nursery's negligence. This concurring act, whether or not caused by the child, does not absolve the nursery from liability. The verdict will not focus on attributes of the child, such as age or size, since they were not provided in evidence, nor in the existence of other witnesses related to the child that were not produced in the trial.

The court will find sufficient evidence to support the jury’s findings that the employee's act of negligently placing the wheelbarrow behind Mrs. Benavides was the proximate cause of the injury. Given the testimony and the evidence presented at trial, the defense that the collapsing of the wheelbarrow was solely due to a child’s intervention will not overcome the established finding of negligence on the part of the nursery’s employee.

The court will hold that the theory of new and independent cause does not apply in this case because even if the child did turn over the wheelbarrow, this act did not break the chain of causation that started with the nursery's negligence. The nursery's liability arises because its initial negligence set the stage for the subsequent injury, regardless of the child's actions.

The court will also address the nursery's multiple points of appeal, finding them without merit. Points regarding no evidence, insufficiency of evidence, and overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence to support the jury’s findings will be overruled. Similarly, the court will reject the nursery's claims of jury bias, passion, and prejudice related to the damages award of $8,000 and can refuse to require a remittitur. The jury's decision on the award amount will stand, presumed reasonable and appropriately assessed given the evidence of Mrs. Benavides' suffering, medical treatment, and loss of work.

Overall, the court will conclude that the trial court correctly ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and that there are no grounds for a reversal of the decision. The nursery's appeal will fail, and the judgement in favor of the plaintiffs will be affirmed."
"In this medical malpractice case, appellant Robert Hattaway underwent a back operation performed by Dr. Stephen Earle on April 4, 1991. The surgery involved the insertion of a metal bone plate, screws, and a bone growth stimulator. In a seminar prior to the surgery, a manufacturer's representative warned against the stimulator leads coming into contact with the metal plate or screws. Despite this, during Hattaway's surgery, Dr. Earle wrapped the stimulator leads around the metal screws.

In October 1992, Hattaway experienced a significant increase in pain. Dr. Earle and Dr. Murphy, to whom Earle referred Hattaway, provided various explanations for Hattaway's pain and discussed the possibility of hardware-induced pain and instability above the Steffee plates. Throughout the follow-up care, Earle provided reasons for the pain but did not definitively inform Hattaway of a failed fusion or loosened hardware. In March 1994, Hattaway's sister informed him about a 20/20 program discussing back surgery and the absence of FDA approval for the hardware used in his spine. Subsequently, Hattaway sought legal advice and, in May 1994, had surgery to remove the hardware.

Hattaway filed suit in January 1995, outside the two-year statute of limitations, alleging that Dr. Earle was negligent in the performance of the back surgery and in failing to disclose issues surrounding the surgery and follow-up care. Hattaway argued that the summary judgment was erroneously based on limitations, claiming Dr. Earle fraudulently concealed the negligence, and raised issues about whether Earle violated the standard of care during follow-up care. The trial court initially ruled in favor of Dr. Earle. Hattaway appealed, and the appellate court considered arguments regarding fraudulent concealment, the open courts doctrine, and alleged errors in follow-up care.","As the appellate court evaluates the appeal, it first assesses whether Dr. Earle fraudulently concealed his negligence, which would toll the statute of limitations. The court identifies two aspects of fraudulent concealment: actual knowledge of the wrong and a fixed purpose to conceal the wrong. Given Dr. Earle's undisclosed modification of the surgical procedure by wrapping the stimulator leads around the hardware screws despite being warned against it, a fact issue arises regarding whether his concealment was purposeful and therefore fraudulent—a critical point for determining whether the limitations period was tolled. In addition, the court will deliberate the open courts doctrine, which posits that the limitations period should not bar a cause of action before the claimant has a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit. Since Hattaway did not learn about the absence of FDA approval (which could be a sign of fraudulent concealment) until after the limitations period, applying limitations would violate the open courts provision.

The court evaluates the reasonableness of the delay in filing the suit post-discovery of the lack of FDA approval. It appears that nine months elapsed between Hattaway's discovery and the filing of the lawsuit. The reasonableness of this delay is typically a factual question, making summary judgment inappropriate if the evidence is favorable to the claimant.

Regarding Dr. Earle's summary judgment motion on follow-up care claims, the appellate court scrutinizes the requirements for granting summary judgment and the non-movant's burden of raising material fact issues. The court will likely find that Hattaway's evidence regarding Dr. Earle's alleged failure to disclose the potential loosening of hardware and the failed fusion could raise such facts. As these matters are not for resolution in summary judgment proceedings but rather by a jury at trial, summary judgment on follow-up care claims will likely be deemed inappropriate.

In conclusion, the appellate court will reverse the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Earle. The reasonings will include that there were fact issues related to fraudulent concealment and violation of the open courts doctrine concerning the surgery, and genuine issues of material fact concerning Dr. Earle's negligence in follow-up care. The case will be remanded for further proceedings."
"Combined American Insurance Company (Appellant) issued two accident insurance policies to Rufus P. McCall, specifying that death benefits would be payable conditional to the policy provisions. The policies provided coverage for losses resulting ""directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injuries received . . . while this policy is in force and which loss or injuries are in no way caused or contributed to by disease."" Pauline McCall, the insured's wife named as the beneficiary (Appellee), filed claims under both policies after her husband was found dead in a shallow playa lake next to his submerged pickup truck, with the autopsy reporting ""CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS WITH RECENT THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION AND OLD MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION"" as the cause of death. The Appellant denied the claim, asserting that the death was not accidental as it was contributed to by disease rather than being the sole result of accidental bodily injuries. Consequently, a lawsuit was initiated.

The background of the case includes the details of Rufus P. McCall's movement on February 9 and 10, 1972, the condition of the pickup truck, the autopsy results by Dr. H. P. Clifton, Jr., and the subsequent inquest by Justice Stanley Doss, concluding that McCall died from a heart attack caused by a motor vehicle accident. Throughout the case, the Appellee's contention was that McCall's death resulted from injuries due to an accident—an assertion supposedly supported by circumstances reconstructed by the investigating highway patrolman and the opinions of Dr. Clifton.

Additional evidence presented by Appellee and Appellant traced McCall's medical history back to 1948, which included multiple instances of heart-related illnesses, from bronchopneumonia with acute paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, other medical findings in 1955, a 1969 diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease, treatments and subsequent re-examinations by Dr. Joe A. Arrington, and the July 1970 hospitalization for sinusitis, polycythemia, and A.S.H.D. Both Dr. Clifton and Dr. Arrington provided expert medical testimonies indicating that pre-existing disease contributed to McCall's heart attack and subsequent death.

After presenting the evidence, Appellant moved for an instructed verdict, asserting that McCall's pre-existing disease contributed to his death, but the motion was overruled, and the case went to jury trial. The jury found in favor of the Appellee, and thus, a judgment was rendered for her. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision by seeking a review of the judgment, arguing that the trial court should have instructed a verdict in its favor because the undisputed evidence established that a pre-existing, uninsured disease contributed to McCall's death.","The Appellant will assert that the trial court should have granted its motion for an instructed verdict based on the explicit contractual liability terms of the insurance policies that require death to result solely from insured accidental bodily injuries, independently of all other causes, and not contributed to by the disease. The court will be persuaded by the unanimous and uncontroverted expert opinions that established a reasonable medical probability linking pre-existing disease to McCall's death. The Appellant will argue that both medical experts agreed the pre-existing disease contributed to the fatal heart attack, thereby negating the requirement that death be caused solely by accidental injury as stipulated in the policies.

Additionally, the Appellant will likely contend that the evidence presented by the Appellee surrounding the reconstruction of events and her husband’s good health prior to the accident is speculative and insufficient to create a fact issue, as it is contradicted by documented medical history and expert medical opinions indicating the necessity of pre-existing disease for such an event (the type of clot leading to occlusion) to occur. Furthermore, Appellant will argue that a layman's opinion, such as the Justice of the Peace's findings in the inquest report and on the certificate of death, cannot override the conclusive medical expert testimony on matters of specialized medical knowledge, such as the cause of a heart attack.

Considering the totality of the evidence, and particularly the competent medical evidence based on a reasonable medical probability, the court will likely reverse the judgment of the trial court and render a verdict that Appellee take nothing. The reason being that there is no competent evidence indicating that McCall’s accidental bodily injuries were the sole cause of his death, as per the terms stipulated in the insurance policies and decided in similar legal precedents like Mutual Benefit Health & Accident Ass'n v. Hudman. Therefore, the court will conclude that the trial court erred in not granting the instructed verdict for the Appellant."
"Angela N. Holder, formerly known as Angela N. Hamilton, pursued legal action after being sexually assaulted by a Houston police officer, Calvin Potter, in a garage owned by Mellon Mortgage Company (""Mellon"") and monitored by the City of Houston (""the City""). The incident took place on November 8, 1992, when Officer Potter, while on duty and using a City squad car, stopped Holder for a purported traffic violation and instructed her to follow him to Mellon's garage. This garage was poorly lit, easily accessible, unattended, and unsecured at the time of the assault.

Holder filed suit against Mellon and the City on June 27, 1994. Against Mellon, she claimed negligence per se for violations of city ordinances (deeming the garage a ""dangerous building"") and common law negligence for failing to prevent a foreseeable injury by leaving the garage open and accessible. She alleged gross negligence and also asserted a loss of consortium claim on behalf of her minor child. Against the City, Holder alleged negligence in their supervision of Potter and his use of the City patrol car.

Mellon requested summary judgment arguing: 1) the City Ordinance was not applicable, 2) Mellon owed no legal duty to Holder as she was considered a trespasser, 3) the criminal conduct was unforeseeable, 4) Mellon's conduct was too remotely connected to establish causation, and 5) the submitted loss of consortium claim was invalid without alleging serious, permanent, and disabling injuries. The City claimed immunity from suit, stating Holder's claims did not fall within the TTCA’s limited waiver. The trial court granted Mellon's motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds, upheld Mellon's objection to the security expert affidavit provided by Holder, and approved the City’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.","Regarding the City's appeal affirmation - the appellate court found that the City was immune from the lawsuit, stating the City's immunity was not waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act due to the criminal nature of the police officer's intentional tort. It will predict that Holder failed to allege an injury related to the use of property under the TTCA, emphasizing that Holder's injury was caused by an intentional assault rather than negligence related to the City's use of property. Thus, Holder's claims against the City for negligence in the supervision of Officer Potter and the misuse of the patrol car will be dismissed, as these claims pertain to an intentional tort committed by a government employee exempt under the TTCA.

Regarding Mellon's appeal - the court will reverse the summary judgment in favor of Mellon since the summary judgment proof included evidence that led to fact questions regarding foreseeability, negligence, and gross negligence. The court will find that there were prior violent crimes reported in the vicinity of Mellon's garage, which could establish foreseeability of criminal conduct. Furthermore, the testimony provided by Mellon employees about crime concerns and the admission that parking garages in Houston are susceptible to criminal activity will contribute to demonstrating a foreseeable risk. Thus, Mellon may have had a duty to take measures to prevent such risks.

The summary judgment on Mellon's liability for common law negligence will be reversed based on the evidence asserting: 1) the existence of a high crime area around Mellon's garage, 2) the inherent risk of criminal activity in unattended parking garages, and 3) the feasibility and low cost of securing the garage using something as simple as a chain. The court will use the rationale that Mellon's garage provided a unique opportunity for crime due to its condition during non-business hours, which may have contributed to the assault's occurrence. Additionally, due to Mellon's actual knowledge of crimes in the surrounding area and the concerns raised by employees, the court will find that Mellon may have been grossly negligent by not taking reasonable security precautions.

Regarding the loss of consortium claim for Holder's minor child, the court will reverse the summary judgment because Mellon failed to file special exceptions opposing the pleading's sufficiency regarding the seriousness of Holder's injuries. This error in granting summary judgment will be identified because courts need to provide an opportunity to correct pleading deficiencies before issuing such judgments.

Finally, the court will reverse the trial court's exclusion of Holder's expert security witness’s affidavit, finding that the objection by Mellon was not specific enough and thus deprived the court of substantial evidence on foreseeability.

Ultimately, the appellate court will direct attention to factual questions related to foreseeability, duty of care, and causation that are inappropriate for summary judgment and should instead be decided by a trial."
"Appellant insurer initiated a case seeking to overturn an award made by the Texas Industrial Accident Board granted to appellees, a wife and child of a deceased worker. The decedent was employed by the Gulf Refining Company at a gas plant in Port Arthur, Texas. On October 26, 1922, an accident occurred at the plant, resulting in the decedent inhaling chlorine gas after machinery malfunctioned. He was hospitalized for over two days and then sent home. Weeks later, he was diagnosed with double lobar pneumonia and subsequently died on December 2. The wife and child filed for compensation from the Industrial Accident Board, which awarded them $15 per week for 360 weeks. The insurer disputed the claim on the basis that the decedent's death was not the result of an ""injury"" received in the course of employment, according to the definition in the Workmen's Compensation Act of Texas.

Evidence showed the decedent's significant exposure to chlorine gas leading to his immediate and prolonged medical symptoms, including coughing and spitting blood. Testimony also indicated his weakened condition post-hospitalization and continued work despite his health issues. Although the insurer presented opinions from physicians that pneumonia was not related to chlorine gas inhalation, there was evidence, including expert testimony, suggesting that the injury to the lungs from the gas could naturally result in pneumonia.

During the trial, the jury's special issues verdict led to a judgment in favor of the wife and minor child, awarding half of the compensation to each, with the minor's share to be redeemed in a lump sum calculated at $2,240.11. The insurer appealed, arguing multiple points including that the disease of lobar pneumonia could not naturally result from chlorine gas inhalation, and that the court erred in not directing a verdict in its favor. They also challenged the adequacy of the minor's pleadings, the evidence, and the structure of the judgment in favor of both appellees.","In predicting the verdict, the court will uphold the district court's judgment based on the interpretation of the Workmen's Compensation Act and the broad definition of ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" within it. It will note that the requirement for an injury to be compensable is not that the disease must usually and ordinarily result from such an injury but that the disease naturally resulted from the accident considering human anatomy and common experiences. The verdict will be guided by the legislature's intent and the act's provisions, emphasizing that injuries received in the course of employment should be compensated, and restricting its interpretation to not require the element of proximate cause typically needed in actionable negligence.

Furthermore, the court will find the evidence presented at trial sufficient for a jury to conclude that inhalation of chlorine gas was the exciting and efficient cause of Smith's death from pneumonia. Therefore, the verdict will acknowledge that the act does not necessitate the disease to be a typical result of the injury, but that it must naturally follow the injury considering the facts of the case.

Additionally, the court will reject the appellant's argument regarding the structure of the compensation judgment, as it will recognize the court's discretion in awarding a lump sum to one beneficiary while providing weekly payments to another, considering their different circumstances. The court will detail that there is no legislative or judicial precedent prohibiting such a judgment structure and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in meeting the minor's specific needs through a lump sum payment.

In conclusion, the detailed reasons for affirming the district court's judgment will include the act's intent, the sufficient evidence connecting Smith's death to his work injury, and the discretionary nature of the award structure given the beneficiaries' disparate situations. The insurer's contentions will not overturn the award, and the verdict for the wife and minor child will stand as initially rendered."
"Plaintiff Miguel N. Lopez visited defendant dentist Emma Carrillo, D.D.S., for dental work. During the procedure, a dental drill bit (referred to as a bur) fell into Lopez's mouth while it was open and landed on the back of his tongue, which he then swallowed. The precise mechanism causing the bur to be dropped is disputed: either it came loose from a drill being used by Carrillo or became magnetized to another instrument and then detached. Lopez alleged that as a result of swallowing the drill bit, he suffered physical pain, mental anguish, and incurred medical expenses.

Carrillo moved for summary judgment on the grounds of absence of negligence and that her actions were not the proximate cause of any damages to Lopez. Carrillo supported her motion with an affidavit stating she adhered to the applicable standard of care and that her actions did not proximately cause Lopez any harm. Lopez objected to the affidavit as being based on hearsay, conclusory, and lacking indication of the source of Carrillo's personal knowledge. Lopez filed his own affidavit, claiming it raised material fact issues regarding negligence and proximate cause.

Carrillo responded by objecting to portions of Lopez's affidavit and moved to supplement her summary judgment evidence with deposition testimony from Dr. Mario Jimenez, who stated Lopez suffered no physical harm from swallowing the drill bit. The trial court struck the contested parts of Lopez's affidavit, allowed Carrillo to supplement her evidence, and granted summary judgment in her favor without stating the grounding reasons.","The court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Emma Carrillo, D.D.S., holding that her expert testimony successfully negated the negligence and proximate cause elements of the plaintiff, Miguel N. Lopez's, cause of action. Thus, Carrillo will be entitled to summary judgment as there is no fact issue raised by Lopez that would warrant a trial.

In reaching this verdict, the court will find Carrillo's affidavit to be competent evidence for summary judgment. It will determine that Carrillo's qualifications as a dental expert and her account of the treatment she provided to Lopez illustrated her personal knowledge of the incident and the actions she took immediately afterwards. The court will conclude that it is not necessary for the affidavit to detail how personal knowledge was acquired when it is evident from the content of the testimony.

Additionally, the hearsay statements within Carrillo's affidavit regarding Lopez's medical condition, relayed to her by another physician, will not lead to the affidavit's incompetency since experts can rely on hearsay in forming their opinions under Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 703. Furthermore, the court will deem Carrillo's statements in her affidavit not impermissibly conclusory when read in proper context.

Regarding Lopez's summary judgment proof based on his own affidavit, the court will find it insufficient to raise a fact issue on proximate cause. It will determine that expert testimony is generally required to establish both medical negligence and causation, and that while Lopez's affidavit may challenge Carrillo's version of events in regards to negligence, it fails to present any expert testimony on causation. Therefore, without such testimony to contradict Carrillo's expert assessment, no fact issue on proximate cause exists.

Overall, since Carrillo's expert testimony as a movant in a medical malpractice action conclusively negated the elements of Lopez's cause of action and Lopez, as the non-movant, failed to provide competent summary judgment proof to raise a fact issue, Carrillo will be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Consequently, the summary judgment will be affirmed, siding with Carrillo."
"Albert Casstevens, an employee of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, was injured when a piece of steel flew from a hammer and injured his finger. After the initial injury, he continued working for 14 days before seeking medical treatment and ultimately filed a lawsuit against the railway company for damages resulting from the injury. Casstevens claimed that the hammer, which was allegedly provided by the railway company, was defective due to being made of poor material and having been in long use, making it brittle and prone to flaking off in slivers. He alleged that the defects were known, or should have been known, by his superiors, Bill Dyer and D. W. Aiken, who were agents of the defendant, but they failed to furnish him with a non-defective hammer. This failure, Casstevens argued, constituted negligence and was the proximate cause of his injury.

Furthermore, Casstevens claimed that before the incident, he had notified his superiors about the hammer's defective condition and had been promised a new one, which he never received. He contended that his continued use of the hammer was not contributory negligence since he was acting under the promise of getting a replacement. During the trial, the plaintiff identified the hammer as the one that caused his injury, which the railway company's witnesses (Aiken and Dyer) denied having provided to Casstevens. Additionally, the defendants argued that railway employees would regularly bring their own tools for work. Furthermore, the testimonies of Aiken and Dyer, who had denied the conversations about the hammer defects and their promise of providing a new hammer, had been contradicted by Casstevens.

Casstevens' case went to a jury trial, where special issues were submitted regarding whether the railway company had furnished the hammer, whether the injury was brought to the attention of the superiors, promises made concerning a new hammer, knowledge of the defective hammer, and the cause of the plaintiff's illness. The jury's findings concluded that the hammer was not furnished by the company, was not defective, and that Casstevens' illness was a result of a disease rather than the workplace injury. There were also findings pertaining to the plaintiff's ability to have procured another hammer himself, the absence of contributory negligence on his part, and whether the injury was the result of an unavoidable accident.

During post-trial proceedings, allegations of juror misconduct emerged. A juror testified that the jury had preliminarily agreed to make decisions based on the majority rule rather than consensus, but the trial court did not grant a mistrial based on this alleged juror misconduct.","The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, essentially upholding the jury's verdict. The court found that the jury's determinations that the hammer was not furnished by the railway company, was not defective, and that the employee's illness was the result of a disease were in compliance with Casstevens' pleadings. Since the jury found that the illness was not caused by the workplace injury, any potential error in the instructions to the jury regarding the railway's negligence was considered harmless. 

The court also found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to grant a mistrial based on the alleged juror misconduct. The trial judge has considerable discretion in determining the impact of juror misconduct on the verdict, and the appellate court did not find that the trial judge had abused that discretion. 

Additionally, the appellate court reasoned that the agreement among jurors to determine their decision by a majority vote negated neither the jury's unanimous consent to the final verdict nor their individual responsible decisions. This conclusion was evidenced by the jurors' assent, through nodding or silence, when the court inquired if they agreed with the verdict. Thus, the appellant's right of recovery had been addressed appropriately based on the issues submitted to the jury, aligning with the pleadings. The jury's additional finding that Casstevens' illness resulted from disease independently validated the judgement, regardless of other findings about the hammer's condition or the company's negligence."
"In August 2014, Robert W. Lambert and Linda C. Lambert purchased approximately 125 acres of ranch land in San Saba County (the Property) with the intention of making it their country home. They planned to clear various trees, including dead post oak and live oak trees resulting from a severe drought in 2011, and to eradicate cactus growth on the Property.

In December 2014, Jim Bob Armes cleared cedar and mesquite trees from the Property. Armes suggested using a method other than a tractor and blade to remove the cactus, which would create large piles of dirt and dead cactus. He recommended contacting Theodore Reese Kerr, Jr., who could potentially kill the cactus using an herbicide.

Robert Lambert contacted Kerr, and they discussed the work and fees on December 15, 2014. Kerr stated he would spray the cactus with an herbicide called Picloram 22K, assuring Lambert that it would not harm the oak trees. Spraying began the next day and continued until the first week of February 2015.

Gary Jennings, who owned adjoining land, informed Lambert in May 2015 that the oak trees on the Property appeared to be dying. Jennings had noted that trees on his and other nearby properties looked healthier in comparison. Lambert then contacted Kerr regarding the apparently damaged trees. Kerr maintained his previous assertion that Picloram 22K, which he had sprayed, would not harm oak trees.

The Lamberts hired arborist Michael J. Walterscheidt to assess their trees. He concluded that the oak trees were dying and, by spring 2016, he and Lambert tagged over 1,000 oak trees on the Property as either dead or unlikely to survive, attributing their condition to the herbicide application.

In October 2016, the Lamberts sued Kerr and Cowpuncher Investments, LLC, d/b/a Cowpuncher Services (Cowpuncher), alleging violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), fraud, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation. They claimed Kerr, individually and as an agent for Cowpuncher, misrepresented that the primary chemical used to kill the cactus, Picloram, would not harm the trees, which the Lamberts contended they relied upon when hiring Kerr and paying him $23,400. Despite these assurances, they alleged that the herbicide ""proved to be lethal to hundreds of trees.""

After a bench trial, the trial court awarded the Lamberts $151,950 in damages and additional amounts for attorneys' fees, conditional appellate attorneys' fees, and pre-and post-judgment interest. Kerr and Cowpuncher appealed, challenging the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting several trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law.","The trial court's judgment will be affirmed based on the collective testimony and evidence presented during the trial.

Firstly, the legal sufficiency of findings related to reliance was confirmed. Robert Lambert's testimony that he would not have hired Kerr had he been informed of the potential risk of herbicide harm to trees is considered credible evidence supporting the trial court's finding on reliance. Considering the consumer's requirement to show detrimental reliance on the defendant's deceptive act under DTPA section 17.50(a)(1)(B), Lambert's testimony demonstrates such reliance.

Next, in addressing sub-issues related to causation, the testimony of arborist Walterscheidt and landowner Jennings provided substantial support for the causation findings. Walterscheidt, qualified in horticulture and plant pathology, directly attributed the death of trees on the Property to the herbicide application. Furthermore, Jennings testified about the correlation between dying trees and sprayed cacti, suggesting the herbicide's role. Despite contrary claims by Zane Willard, a manufacturer's rep, and Troy Ruffin, Picloram 22K seller, that Picloram could not harm trees, the trial court as the factfinder was entitled to make credibility determinations and rely on expert testimony that supported the injury to the trees.

Regarding Kerr's knowledge, the contributing piece of evidence arose from Begnaud's testimony that Kerr acknowledged Picloram could cause injury to trees during a 2016 discussion. Kerr, a licensed commercial applicator, was legally required to be familiar with the product's label, which contains warnings about the potential for Picloram to ""control"" trees, including oak trees, indicating a possibility of harm.

For additional damages, the testimony regarding Kerr's knowledge substantiates the trial court's award of ""additional damages"" under the DTPA, permitted when a defendant has committed a violation ""knowingly.""

Lastly, the court did not regard the $9,450 compensation for dead trees' removal as a ""double recovery"" but as a separate, reasonable expense incurred due to Kerr and Cowpuncher's DTPA violations.

Upon this detailed evaluation, the appellate court predicted that each of the concerns raised by Kerr and Cowpuncher will be overruled, and the trial court's judgment will be affirmed in totality. The evidence was legally sufficient to support the verdict. Kerr and Cowpuncher's misrepresentations about Picloram were identified as the injury's producing cause, justifying the damages awarded to the Lamberts."
"Appellant, a company engaged in curing hides, was operating in a city section designated for slaughterhouses and similar industries. The appellee, a father, filed a lawsuit against the company claiming it was a nuisance and contributed to his daughter's death. The daughter, who was 25 years old and suffered from asthma, died from disease and malarial fever allegedly caused by exposure to conditions created by the company's business. Physicians testified that the fever was caused by mosquitoes, and others elaborated on the harmful health effects resulting from decaying organic matter and the use of chemicals in the hide-curing process. Five physicians provided expert testimony at trial.

The appellant's business practices included handling hides in a green state, allowing flesh to rot, and creating conditions that attracted flies and mosquitoes, and resulted in an emission of foul odors. This environment was claimed to have resulted in the sickness and subsequent death of the daughter. The father alleged her death was a result of breathing the ""poisoned atmosphere"" emanating from the hide-curing process and sought damages for the loss of her labor in his household. The company argued it operated lawfully, exercised due care, and that the father knowingly moved into the area. After a jury trial, the lower court awarded the father a verdict in favor of $1,000 in damages.","The verdict will affirm the judgment based on the proximate cause principle. The proximate cause doesn't necessarily need to be the last or sole cause of harm—rather, it must be a significant contributing factor that could reasonably have been foreseen as leading to the result under the given circumstances. In this instance, the hide-curing operation and its attendant noxious atmosphere will be recognized as a proximate cause of the daughter's death, as the conditions reasonably could have been anticipated to harm the health of those in the vicinity.

The lawful nature of the company's business and the city's authorization for such an operation in the specified locality will not serve as a defense if the business practices resulted in harmful consequences to life, health, or property. It is irrelevant that the business was necessary and useful to the community or that the father moved to the area after the establishment of the business; neither will absolve the company from liability for creating a nuisance.

Suffering from such a nuisance will be considered a legitimate element of damages, and recovery for sickness resulting from the nuisance will be allowed. The statutes will permit an action for actual damages where death is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, or default of another. The daughter in this case could have maintained an action for injury to her health, and hence, after her death due to said injury, the father was entitled to sue for damages resulting to him.

The detailed testimonies and evidence provided by medical experts will establish a reliable connection between the company's practices and the decaying atmosphere, supporting the court’s conclusions. It will be agreed upon that breathing air laden with decay from the company's operations was detrimental to the deceased's health, weakening her to the point where she could not withstand the onset of malarial fever.

Overall, the evidence will be considered sufficient to establish the company's culpability, and the jury's determination will be respected for its assessment of evidence and factual findings. The company’s appeal will ultimately be dismissed, and the lower court's judgment upheld."
"On the night of May 13, 1929, three men, Doc Franklin Webster, Tom Webster, and Bowen Daniels, were killed by coming in contact with a downed power line belonging to the Texas-Louisiana Power Company. The line had been struck by lightning about 18 hours earlier, three miles south of Bells, in Grayson county, Texas. Bowen Daniels' mother, Mrs. N.E. Daniels, filed a lawsuit against the power company, claiming that negligence on the part of the power company had caused her son’s death. She was awarded $7,500 in damages by the trial court.

The power company appealed the verdict, arguing that the court made errors, including refusing to give its requested instructions on the issue of actionable negligence. The power company was statutorily obligated to maintain its power lines 22 feet above the ground per Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 1436 (1925) and also had a duty to exercise reasonable care in inspecting and addressing dangerous conditions. Due to the lines being low to the ground for an extended period, a presumption of negligence was placed upon the power company, which they completely failed to rebut. The jury found the power company was guilty of negligence by allowing its wires to remain low, failing to have a watchman present, and keeping its wires charged with electricity while they hung near the ground. These findings encompassed the fact that the company knew, or should have known, about the hazardous state of the lines.

Moreover, the company argued that Bowen Daniels was a trespasser and thus not owed a duty of care, that his death was the result of an act of God, or that it was an unavoidable accident. They also contended that Daniels had entered the property for an illegal purpose (theft), which should preclude liability. The court dismissed these arguments. The power company also raised the issue of contributory negligence, listing several acts of Daniels that might have contributed to his death (such as entering at night without a light and not asking for a guide), but the court found that contributory negligence was not applicable as Daniels and his companions were unaware of the dangerous condition of the power line or its existence.","The appellate court, in affirming the lower court's judgment, will hold that the power company's arguments are unavailing. The appellate court will find that due to statutory obligations placed upon the power company to maintain its lines at a certain height and the extended period for which the dangerous condition was allowed to persist, a presumption of negligence adequately arose. The power company will fail to provide evidence that overcomes this presumption by demonstrating it exercised reasonable care.

Additionally, the appellate court will reject the power company's contention relating to the supposed contributory negligence of Bowen Daniels. The appellate court will reason that since Daniels and his companions were ignorant of the presence and danger of the power line, there was no duty to exercise care that would otherwise be required if one were aware of such danger. The court will further elaborate that the issue of contributory negligence did not factor into this case since Daniels’ lack of awareness and expectation of the power line indicated no breach of duty for self-protection on his part.

The power company's attempt to argue that specific acts of Daniels constituted contributory negligence will be dismissed because these acts were not related to the condition of the lines, as Daniels was unaware of the hazards. The appellate court's decision will also rest on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows an inference of negligence when an accident of this type would not ordinarily occur if those who manage the situation had exercised proper care. Given the explicit statutory requirement and the condition of the lines being clearly observable, the power company’s failure to address the situation will be viewed as a breach of its duty of care.

In conclusion, the appellate court will affirm the trial court’s judgment in favor of Mrs. N.E. Daniels, and the power company's appeal will be denied, resulting in the power company being held liable for the death of Bowen Daniels."
"Appellant employer is seeking a review of the judgment from the District Court of Hunt County, Texas, which was in favor of appellee employee's family in a negligence action regarding the employee's death. The employee, James Smith, was a foreman of a railway track crew and was inspecting the fence along the railway right of way when he was struck by a large lump of coal that fell from the tender of a passing train. He was standing approximately 12 feet away from the tracks at the time. The family of the deceased claimed that this incident caused the employee's death and that the employer was negligent due to (1) the manner in which the coal was loaded onto the tender, (2) the maintenance of the roadbed and track, and (3) operating the locomotive at an excessively high speed. Additionally, the family alleged that the employer neglected to provide a sufficient number of crew members to maintain the track properly.

During the trial, the employer contested these claims, arguing that the trial court's instruction to the jury was biased as it assumed certain facts to be true—namely, that the train was running at an excessively high rate of speed and that there was an insufficient number of track workers. This, according to the employer, was a charge upon the weight of evidence, which is considered a reversible error. The employer also argued that even if they did not provide enough section men, this did not contribute to the incident of the coal falling and therefore should not be a ground for recovery as it was not the proximate cause of the injury.

Furthermore, the employer argued that there was evidence suggesting that Smith's death could have been due to a mastoid abscess, which may not have been the natural and proximate result of the injury sustained from the coal impact. They sought to have the jury decide if this condition was the direct result of the injury and the proximate cause of death. The employer also presented a special charge requesting the jury to consider if Smith's death was due to effects of syphilis from which he may have suffered but this charge was refused by the court.","In the verdict, the court is expected to reverse the judgment for the family and remand the action for a new trial. The reasoning behind this would likely center on the issues raised by the employer regarding the jury charge at the original trial. The court will likely find that, indeed, the instruction given to the jury was biased as it assumed certain contested facts to be true—particularly the speed of the train and the number of track workers—and therefore influenced the weight of evidence inappropriately.

The court will also probably agree with the appellant that it was error to submit as a ground for recovery the alleged failure to furnish an adequate number of section workers to maintain the track, as this was a remote incident and not the proximate cause of the injury and resultant death. This is supported by the principle that only negligence which is the proximate cause of the injury can justify recovery in a negligence action.

Regarding the issue of proximate cause of death, the court will likely agree that the jury should be given a clear charge addressing whether the primary cause of death was the injury inflicted by the lump of coal or a disease unrelated to the injury. The court will suggest that the appellant deserves a fair opportunity to present its theory that the death resulted solely from natural causes unrelated to the alleged negligence.

Finally, the court will have supported its refusal of special charge No. 8 regarding the disease of syphilis; however, it will indicate that the employer is entitled to have the issue of whether the death was solely the result of the disease put before the jury in an affirmative manner—not one that presupposes the disease's impact on the cause of death.

The judgment being reversed and the case remanded would mean a new trial wherein all these considerations must be taken into account to ensure a fair and balanced presentation of the issues to the jury."
"Appellant employer (Texas Farm Products Company) sought review of a judgment from the 145th Judicial District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, which entered in favor of appellee employee (Paul Stock) for personal injuries he sustained during the course of his employment. Stock slipped and fell on grease at his workplace, resulting in injuries, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against the employer. The trial court, based on jury findings, granted Stock a judgment for money damages totaling $219,670.

Stock was a 54-year-old mechanic employed by the non-subscriber employer to a policy of worker's compensation insurance under the Texas Worker's Compensation Act, which makes the employer subject to enhanced liabilities. On February 27, 1980, upon entering his work stall, he slipped on a patch of grease. Another employee observed the grease spot after the fall. Stock was hospitalized under Dr. Anthony W. Jorgenson's care and diagnosed with a rare bone disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, making his bones prone to fractures and deformities under ordinary conditions. He also suffered from a compression fracture of his second lumbar vertebrae (L-2), which did not aggravate his pre-existing condition but caused pain and was disabled due to the pain stemming from nerve root pressure.

Stock's injuries included past and future pain and mental anguish, loss of earnings, earning capacity, physical impairment, and medical expenses. The employer argued a series of points of error, including that it didn't owe a duty to Stock to keep the floor free of grease, that there was insufficient evidence for the submission of special issues to the jury, that jury findings related to the presence of grease on the floor and the employer's knowledge of it were unsupported by evidence, and that the damages were excessive. The employer also contended that Stock's counsel's misconduct during the trial prejudiced the jury.","The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the employer was liable for actionable negligence due to failure to maintain a safe work environment and for knowing that the grease had been on the floor for a sufficient amount of time for any reasonable employee to have discovered and remedied the situation, given that the employer did not have a clean-up crew or inspect work areas between shifts.

The trial court did not err in overruling the motion for an instructed verdict as sufficient evidence raised the issue of actionable negligence on the employer's part. The jury findings were sufficient to establish liability, and any errors in instructions to the jury were considered harmless considering supporting jury findings on other issues. The misconduct of Stock's counsel, though improper, was found to be rendered harmless by the trial court's prompt admonition to disregard and was insufficient to show that it caused an improper judgment.

The court would conclude that damages for past and future physical impairment were excessive and will require a remittitur (a reduction of the amount of damages awarded by the jury) to affirm the judgment. Should the appellee file a written remittitur in the specified amount (reduced by $39,370) within a given timeframe, the judgment will be affirmed; otherwise, it will be reversed and remanded for a new trial due to the excessive damages initially awarded. The court will recognize the employer's liability for negligence, but conditionally affirm the ruling with the adjustment of damages."
"The fatal collision occurred late at night on November 18, 1932, when decedent O. M. Brack drove his car into a freight train of the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway Company, which had been left standing across McColl road, a paved public road in Texas. The train, moving from west to east, was stalled as its crew was engaged in operations on a switch or siding to the east. A low, dark-colored oil tank car was left standing across the road's paved portion, flanked on both sides by large, light-colored box cars. This positioning made it challenging to see the oil tank car until one was very close. Two eyewitnesses, Scroggins and Dean, who were waiting at the crossing before the collision, testified they had also mistakenly believed the crossing was clear until they came close to the obscured oil tank car.

Brack approached the crossing believing it to be open, but collided with the oil tank car and was fatally injured. The jury found that at the time of the collision, the railway company had unlawfully blocked the road crossing for more than five minutes, contrary to Texas statutes, and without posting any guards, watchmen, or visible signals, which was negligent and a proximate cause of the collision and death. They also found that Brack was not guilty of contributory negligence.

The railway company appealed, seeking a motion to stay proceedings based on pending bankruptcy proceedings and contended that the plaintiff's evidence showed contributory negligence by the deceased as a matter of law.","Upon review, the key factor for determining the outcome of the case revolves around the legal concept of proximate cause. While the trial court and jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, noting negligence on the part of the railroad company due to the unlawful and prolonged blocking of the road without necessary warnings and the absence of contributory negligence on the part of Brack, the appellate court will focus on the proper legal definition of proximate cause as used at trial.

The appellate court will scrutinize the jury's conclusion that the blocking of the crossing was a proximate cause of the injury and determine if the definition of proximate cause instructed to the jury was correct. The crux of the appellate court's reasoning will hinge on whether the element of foreseeability was adequately included in the given definition.

Given that the proper and universally accepted definition of proximate cause in personal injury actions includes foreseeability — the concept that the injury should have been reasonably anticipated under the given circumstances — the appellate court will likely find that omitting this element is a reversible error. The trial court's definition did not explicitly involve foreseeability, a mistake that potentially rendered the jury's decision flawed.

Therefore, the appellate court will predictably reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the basis that the original trial court's instruction to the jury omitted the foreseeability element in the definition of proximate cause, which is tantamount to reversible error in personal injury actions. The ultimate resolution will require the trial court to use the correct legal definition and consider foreseeability as an essential component of proximate cause. Additionally, some members of the appellate court express uncertainty over the findings related to contributory negligence and wilful blocking of the highway by the defendant, but those issues will remain open for reconsideration in the new trial."
"**

Kevin D. Murray (""Murray"") was involved in a collision on FM 181 while traveling as a front-seat passenger in a vehicle driven by James R. Seymour (""Seymour""). Prior to the incident, Martin A. Gomez, Jr. (""Gomez"") had experienced sudden electrical failure in his Dodge Ram pickup truck with an attached trailer and had to pull onto the improved shoulder of the highway due to non-operational lights—it was night, and the area was dark. Timothy M. White (""White""), driving a Nabors Well Service vehicle (owned by his employer), stopped to offer assistance to Gomez. White parked his truck opposite to Gomez's, facing southbound, and suggested Gomez use a flashlight to signal traffic while they tried to jumpstart Gomez's truck. White's vehicle had flashers on, but he did not set up triangles.

As Seymour's vehicle approached the area where Gomez's vehicle was parked on the shoulder, Seymour's vehicle departed from the lane and onto the shoulder, colliding with Gomez's trailer. This collision caused Gomez's truck and trailer to be pushed into White's parked vehicle, which was propelled backward. After the accident, Gomez's trailer and the Nabors vehicle were partially on the roadway. Murray sued Seymour, Gomez, White, and Nabors for negligence and negligence per se for alleged violations of Texas Transportation Code Sections 545.301(a) and 545.303(a). A default judgment was entered against Gomez, Seymour had been dismissed from the case, and the trial court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of White and Nabors.

The judgment in favor of White and Nabors was affirmed. The court ruled that White did not owe a duty to warn Murray or the general public of the presence of Gomez's disabled vehicle on the roadway. Moreover, even if White had a duty to warn about his own vehicle being on the roadside, any failure to notify was immaterial since White's vehicle did not contribute to the collision or the resulting injuries to Murray. The dispute regarding whether the Nabors vehicle had flashers was deemed not a material fact because the Nabors vehicle didn't factor into the accident's occurrence.

Regarding negligence per se claims, the court found that Murray did not present sufficient evidence that White and Nabors violated Sections 545.301(a) and 545.303(a) of the Texas Transportation Code. Moreover, even if they had violated these statutes, there was no evidence that such violations were the proximate cause of Murray's injuries. As a consequence, White and Nabors were entitled to the summary judgment on the negligence per se claims as well.

In conclusion, White and Nabors did not have a duty to warn about the presence of Gomez's vehicle nor was there evidence that they breached any such duty with respect to their own vehicle. Furthermore, there were no material facts in dispute that could suggest Nabors and White were negligent or that they engaged in negligence per se by violating the traffic statutes in question. Therefore, the summary judgment in favor of Nabors and White was upheld by the appellate court."
"Miss Edna Ellison, the employee, was a long-distance telephone operator for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, which was the employer, and the Texas Compensation Insurance Company was the insurer. She commenced her employment around May 5, 1930. On September 15, 1930, while Ellison was performing her duties during a rain and electric storm, she received an electric shock through her headphones, which led to her being carried out of the room in distress by supervisors. Following initial unconsciousness, she later indicated she had been shocked while putting a call through. 

Miss Ellison managed to return to work after a few days and continued her duties satisfactorily until May 20, 1932, twenty months post-injury. On that date, Ellison fell violently ill, claiming she felt like she did when shocked, and subsequently died on May 30, 1932. Throughout the intervening period between the accident and her death, according to testimonies, Ellison's disposition had changed from vibrant and sociable to withdrawn and perpetually run-down, suffering from various pains and worrying about her health, indicating a lasting impact from the incident.

Following her death, a jury found that the electric shock sustained at work was accidental, the cause of her death, and therefore, Ellison's mother, Mrs. Nannie Ellison, as the surviving parent and sole beneficiary, was entitled to workmen's compensation benefits. The appellant employer challenged this, arguing that there was no causal connection between the injury and death due to the time elapsed and that her death was attributed by physicians to ""infectious psychosis."" Furthermore, the employer claimed that the injury incurred was the result of an act of God—a defense outlined in the 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 8309 —and not due to employment conditions since Ellison was not exposed to any greater hazard than the general public.","The court will affirm the judgment in favor of the employee's mother. The court will hold that the defense of an act of God does not apply in this case because the injury caused, although potentially initiated by an act of God (lightning), occurred due to the employee being engaged in her normal work duties using equipment provided by the employer—specifically, the headphones connected to the switchboard that proved to be the immediate cause of the injury. It will be noted that metallic wires act as conductors for electric currents from lightning and the employee, through her duties, was exposed to a greater hazard from such an act of God than the general public, making the injury compensable under the law.

The argument that no causal connection existed between the injury and the death will be rejected based on the substantial evidence pointing towards such a connection. The employee's persistent health issues and behavioral changes following the shock will be seen as a direct result of the initial incident. Despite the initial recovery and the ability to perform her duties, the longstanding impact of the shock, both mentally and physically, suggests a causal link to her eventual deterioration and death. The court will find that the concept of proximate cause, relevant for negligence cases, does not apply to compensation cases, and therefore the request to establish proximate cause will not warrant a directed verdict.

Regarding the appellant's contention on the award calculation, the court will find that the method of calculation for the compensation adhered to legal requirements outlined in statutes, utilizing the average weekly wage of similar employees. Appellant’s propositions on this front will also be overruled. The court will dismiss objections to the length of time for which compensation was awarded, affirming that the statute specifies compensation should begin from the date of the injury, regardless of any temporary recovery or wages earned by the employee thereafter.

In sum, the court's future reasoning will emphasize that the injury, while perhaps stemming from an act of God, was incurred in the scope of employment which posed a special risk not encountered by the public, and the effects of which causally contributed to the employee's eventual demise. The court will thus support the original award of benefits to the employee's mother."
"Angela Holder was driving late at night in downtown Houston when an on-duty Houston police officer, Calvin Potter, stopped her for an alleged traffic violation. Potter took Holder's insurance and identification cards, then instructed her to follow his patrol car. He directed her several blocks to a parking garage owned by Mellon Mortgage Company. Inside the garage, Officer Potter sexually assaulted Holder in his squad car.

Holder brought legal action against Mellon and the City of Houston for the incident but did not sue her attacker. The trial court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Mellon and the City on all claims by Holder. The court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the City based on sovereign immunity but reversed the summary judgment in favor of Mellon on Holder's claims for negligence, gross negligence, and loss of consortium.

In the litigation, Mellon contended that it owed no legal duty to Holder. The court focused on the issue of foreseeability, specifically whether Mellon could have foreseen that a person would be accosted elsewhere and then forced to drive to its property, where they would be assaulted. The contention was that the attack was not foreseeable to Mellon since respondent was not in a position that could have made her a victim of a third-party criminal act within the foreseeability of the property owner. Mellon claimed it owed no duty to prevent the assault.

Holder's claims against Mellon asserted that the assault was indeed foreseeable given the location of the parking garage in a high-crime area. Further, Holder pointed to evidence such as 190 violent crimes reported near the garage in the two years preceding the incident, a frequency of roughly one violent crime every four days. Additionally, the garage had experienced property crimes, including the theft of an employee's car, and complaints about the lack of security. There had also been reports of vagrants frequently occupying the garage and sometimes drinking there.","The court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that Holder take nothing. The court's reasoning will be based on the analysis of ""foreseeability"" related to premises liability cases. Although the court will acknowledge that a crime occurring in the parking garage was within the realm of possibility given the rate of violent crimes in the nearby area, the court will determine that Holder was not within a class that Mellon could have reasonably anticipated being subject to a criminal act in the garage.

Mellon's owed duty to prevent foreseeable crimes will be defined by factors including the similarity, proximity, recency, frequency, and publicity of previous crimes. The court will extrapolate from the specifics of past crimes to determine foreseeable risks. Despite the history of property crimes in the garage, the court will decide that Mellon could not have reasonably foreseen a sexual assault taking place there, in particular to someone in Holder's circumstances.

The court will reiterate that foreseeability requires that the general type of injury be anticipated, not the precise event, and the injured party should be within an anticipated range of victims. In this case, Mellon's alleged failure to secure the parking garage at night is not related closely enough to the wrongful act—Officer Potter's decision to commit the assault herein—such to render Mellon liable. Additionally, Mellon's steps to provide armed security patrols during weekdays, and random patrols by off-duty police officers during business hours, will be seen as measures acknowledging some level of risk but not indicative of foreseeability related to Holder's specific incident.

Therefore, the court will conclude that Mellon met the requisite standard for a property owner in its position and that Mellon did not breach a legal duty to Holder as her injury was not a reasonably foreseeable outcome of the garage's condition, nor did Mellon have reason to anticipate such a victimization occurring on its property."
"The defendant was convicted of manslaughter after a trial in the District Court of Bexar County, Texas. The incident occurred at a bar where the defendant was working. When the victim requested a deck of cards and the defendant stated he had none, an argument ensued, leading to the victim striking the defendant. The defendant responded by shooting the victim in the leg. Nine days later, the victim died from complications arising from the wound. A key piece of evidence presented by the defense was the testimony of a doctor who examined the victim. The doctor had recommended amputation of the victim's leg to prevent blood poisoning. According to the doctor, the victim and his mother refused the operation. The doctor believed that if the amputation had been performed initially, the victim would not have died. In court, the defense argued that the victim's refusal to undergo amputation constituted gross negligence or improper treatment that should exonerate the defendant. The jury received instructions regarding self-defense, aggravated assault, and manslaughter.","The court will uphold the defendant's conviction. The court will reason that the victim's refusal to have his leg amputated does not constitute gross negligence or manifestly improper treatment as to exonerate the defendant. It will also be determined that the evidence showed no manifest improper treatment or gross neglect of the wound after it was inflicted. The court will conclude that the defendant's act of shooting the victim was the proximate cause of death, and the victim's refusal to undergo amputation does not diminish the defendant's culpability. The court will cite precedents and legal doctrine establishing that if a wound, irrespective of whether it is naturally mortal, contributes to the death of the victim, the party inflicting it is responsible for homicide. It will be articulated that it is not the law that the victim, in facing a strategic medical decision, is obligated to undergo a serious operation like amputation to mitigate the defendant's criminal liability. The court will clarify that the rule regarding ""gross negligence"" or ""manifestly improper treatment"" by someone other than the one inflicting the initial injury (e.g., a physician or nurse) does not apply to the victim's own decisions about their medical treatment. 

Ultimately, the court will find that there was no evidence of gross neglect or improper treatment by any attendants such as physicians or nurses that could have been a direct cause of death other than the wound itself. As a result, the defendant cannot claim that his act was not the proximate cause of the victim's death, and the conviction will stand because the evidence supports the verdict of manslaughter as rendered by the jury."
"Sallye Treme was driving on Highway 59 near Houston with a passenger, Thelma Reinhart. On March 17, 1989, Treme was forced to an abrupt stop after a car cut across the highway, causing traffic ahead to halt. William Carl Young, driving a pickup truck, crashed into Treme’s vehicle about four seconds later, injuring Treme and Reinhart. The incident occurred in good weather and light traffic conditions.

Treme and Reinhart filed a common-law negligence lawsuit against Young, claiming injuries from the collision. Young answered, asserting that the incident was an ""unavoidable accident,"" not caused by any negligence on his part, and cited the emergency doctrine, indicating he had to act hastily without time for deliberation.

The location of the crash was in dispute. Treme indicated the incident happened near a bridge, away from an overpass, while Young testified it occurred on the crest of the overpass, suggesting an obstructed view might have been a contributing factor.

The trial court included an unavoidable accident instruction in the jury charge based on the potential obstruction of view caused by the incline or elevation of the overpass. This directive informed the jurors that they did not necessarily have to find either party to blame for the incident. After Young presented evidence at trial, which included testimony from a public safety officer and Treme, the jury unanimously concluded Young was not negligent, and the court ruled in his favor. The appeals court affirmed, approving the instruction concerning the unavoidable accident due to the overpass creating an obstruction of view. Petitioners claimed no objections about the sudden emergency instruction included in the charge.","The judgment affirmed that Young was not negligent. This is based on several considerations: Young provided strong evidence corroborating his lack of negligence; he was not speeding, as verified by the length of the skid marks, and Treme did not report him following too closely or hear tire squeals. This suggests the unavoidable accident instruction did not influence the jury in a way that led to a different verdict than would have occurred without the instruction.

Furthermore, the jury's failure to find Young negligent was likely unaffected because they had also been instructed about the sudden emergency doctrine without any objection from the petitioners. This doctrine overlaps with the unavoidable accident instruction, and since no objections were made to the sudden emergency instruction, it is unlikely the verdict hinged solely on the unavoidable accident direction.

The jury's verdict did not appear to be explicitly based on the unavoidable accident instruction, as witnesses did not refer to it, and it was minimally mentioned by Young's attorney during closing arguments. Instead, more emphasis was placed on the sudden emergency aspect. Considering the entire record and the presence of the sudden emergency instruction, the existence of the unavoidable accident instruction likely did not mislead or confuse jurors to the degree that would merit reversing the judgment. Thus, the judgment was affirmed, and the trial court’s decision to include the unavoidable accident instruction, given the circumstances, was deemed not to be a reversible error."
"Wilker Cheek went to the emergency room of the appellant hospital, Sisters of St. Joseph of Texas, Inc., on January 17, 1996, complaining of abdominal pain. He was admitted for evaluation and underwent an exploratory laparotomy performed by Dr. Job Buschman, which revealed acute appendicitis. On January 19th, an appendectomy was performed. Initially, Cheek's condition improved post-surgery, but then it deteriorated. He was moved to the intensive care unit on January 23rd and diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. Unfortunately, he passed away on January 25th. The appellees, who are the estate beneficiaries of Wilker Cheek, filed a lawsuit against the appellant hospital and Dr. Buschman, seeking actual and exemplary damages, alleging malice. Dr. Buschman settled during the trial, and thereafter, the jury found both Dr. Buschman and the hospital’s negligence proximately caused the death of Mr. Cheek, and that malice was involved on the part of the hospital. Consequently, the jury awarded exemplary damages against the hospital.

The appellant hospital cited sixteen issues, of which the second issue challenges the legal sufficiency of the appellees’ evidence regarding proximate cause of the negligence by the hospital. Specifically, the appellant questioned whether there was evidence to show that, to a reasonable medical probability, the alleged breaches by the hospital nurses were such that ""but for"" these breaches, Mr. Cheek would have survived, or whether these breaches were significant factors in causing Mr. Cheek’s death.

The expert for the appellees, Dr. Sparks Veasey, testified that Mr. Cheek’s death was caused by a pulmonary embolus which could be related to immobilization, but he gave no opinion on when the clot formed. His testimony stated the failures of the nurses to ambulate Mr. Cheek post-surgery, to recognize signs of pulmonary embolus timely, and to notify the doctor of Mr. Cheek’s emergency status “caused or contributed to” Mr. Cheek’s death. This led to discussions over whether these failures were significant, proximate causes of the death, particularly in light of the jury's instruction defining proximate cause in the context of hospital nurse conduct.","The verdict will be that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that the negligence of the hospital proximately caused the death of Mr. Cheek. The court will sustain the appellant's second issue due to the lack of evidence that satisfies the criteria for establishing proximate cause.

The reasoning will include a discussion about proximate cause, underlining that the cause must be both a substantial factor in bringing about the harm and also such that the harm would not have occurred without it. The evidence must show that the negligence probably resulted in the injury to meet the standard of reasonable medical probability.

Dr. Veasey's use of ""caused or contributed to"" will not meet the legal threshold as it fails to articulate whether the alleged negligence was a substantial factor or the harm would not have occurred without the alleged negligence. Since causation in medical negligence requires more than a possibility and Dr. Veasey did not attest that the absence of the alleged breaches of standard of care would have more likely than not prevented Mr. Cheek's death, his testimony cannot be the basis for establishing proximate cause.

The verdict will reverse the trial court's judgment and render that the appellees take nothing due to this legal insufficiency. The other sixteen issues presented by the appellant will not be addressed because the resolution of the second issue alone will be dispositive of the appeal."
"Refugio Sanchez, an employee of the independent contractor Precision Drilling Holdings Company (Holdings), was injured on a jobsite on April 30, 2013, resulting in the amputation of his leg. The injury occurred when he was transporting Precision Drilling Company, LP's (Precision) Rig 105 to a COG Operating LLC well site, as part of a separate contract COG had with Precision to drill several oil and gas wells, which included transportation known as ""mobilization."" Sanchez, along with his fellow Holdings employees Ivan Torres and Austin Matejowsky, was tasked with loading a portable generator onto a pole truck and relocating it. Using chains and rope as directed by Torres, Sanchez secured the generator to the truck. While Matejowsky directed Torres to back the truck up, the generator began swinging, and as Sanchez attempted to control it, the pole truck ran over his leg and foot.

Sanchez filed a negligence lawsuit against Precision, claiming it breached its duty to maintain a safe work environment during the mobilization. Precision filed for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, which the trial court granted without specifying the grounds, resulting in the dismissal of the lawsuit.

In the summary judgment process, the trial court applied a standard that required considering all evidence favorable to the nonmovant (Sanchez), resolving doubts in his favor. To defeat the no-evidence motion, Sanchez needed to present at least a scintilla of evidence, meaning enough to enable reasonable and fair-minded individuals to differ in their conclusions regarding an essential element of his claim—such as cause-in-fact of his injuries.

Sanchez's primary arguments for causation were focused on Precision employee Ricky Menard's actions, including distracting Matejowsky and not identifying and correcting multiple workplace hazards. In support, Sanchez presented a report by his expert, Douglas W. Smith, who cited Precision's failure to ensure adequate procedures and a safe worksite. Smith's report listed nine contributing factors to the accident, sourced mostly from Holdings' Serious Incident Investigation Report, but didn't clearly connect these factors to any act or omission attributable to Precision.","The trial court's summary judgment in favor of Precision will be affirmed because Sanchez would not have provided sufficient evidence to show that any action or omission by Precision was the cause-in-fact of his injuries. Cause-in-fact refers to whether Precision's alleged negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Sanchez's injury, and whether the injury would not have occurred without it. Given expert witness Smith's failure to specify which of the nine contributing factors were attributable to Menard and lacking clear evidence that Precision's failure to ensure adequate procedures or a safe worksite was a substantial factor in the accident, there would not be more than a scintilla of evidence linking Precision to the cause of Sanchez's injuries.

Since there would have been no more than conjecture as to the cause-in-fact aspect of proximate cause, additional considerations of duty and breach would not need to be addressed. Therefore, in predicting the verdict, Sanchez's claim would fail on the no-evidence summary judgment aspect, as he allegedly would not have provided the necessary evidence of causation required to defeat Precision's motion for summary judgment. Consequently, the trial court would have correctly dismissed Sanchez's suit, supporting the affirmation of the judgment."
"Henry Yap, the appellant, sustained personal injuries resulting from an automobile-truck collision and sued ANR Freight Systems, Inc. (""ANR""), and its employee-driver, David Glenn Coplin. The trial court entered a take-nothing judgment against Yap following a jury verdict. Yap asserted that Coplin's negligence contributed to the collision and that ANR negligently entrusted its vehicle to Coplin. At trial, it was established that on the day of the accident, the weather was misty and the road was wet. Coplin testified that a red car unexpectedly entered his lane from a side street, leading him to brake suddenly and his truck to jackknife into Yap's lane, where the collision occurred. Evidence showed that Coplin was traveling between 25 to 30 mph in a 35 mph zone and took measures to avoid hitting the red car. There were conflicting expert opinions on whether Coplin was negligent in his operation of the vehicle or if he could have anticipated the red car's entrance into the lane. Yap also presented evidence of Coplin’s past medical history, which included surgery for blocked arteries and high blood pressure, to support the negligent entrustment claim. Additionally, a 1980 letter was entered into evidence questioning Coplin's qualifications in an unrelated incident.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, as the evidence at trial could reasonably lead to different conclusions regarding whether Coplin's negligence and past medical issues were the proximate cause of the collision. The court will conclude that the jury appropriately determined that Coplin's negligence was not the substantial factor in causing the collision, and rather, the sudden and unexpected action of the red car pulling onto Mykawa Road was an ""unavoidable accident"" not caused by any party's negligence. Regarding the negligent entrustment claim against ANR, the court will find that Yap failed to prove the fifth element, as Coplin's ongoing health did not proximately cause the accident, notably because there was no evidence of impairment at the time of the collision. Furthermore, the court will dismiss concerns raised by the admission of the photograph of the speed limit sign; it will determine that the image did not affect the judgment since speed control was not linked to proximate cause, which was the core issue. The court will uphold the jury's discretion in weighing witness credibility and reject Yap's assertion that the exclusion of certain testimonies from his expert witness prejudicially affected the outcome. Consequently, the appellate court, agreeing with the jury's evaluation of the facts and finding sufficient legal and factual evidence to support the jury's findings, will affirm the take-nothing judgment against Yap."
"J.A. Norris suffered injuries due to the negligence of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company of Texas while he was riding in a box car during a ""flying switch."" The exact nature of these injuries was not definitively established except for harm to his leg, hip, and a skinned area on his cheek or forehead. This incident occurred on a Saturday afternoon. The following day, Norris, despite some difficulty, loaded some freight onto a wagon pulled by a team of mules with the intention to head home. During this journey, Norris fell from the wagon, sustaining unknown additional injuries. A week after the initial box car incident, he died from a brain hemorrhage.

Norris's wife and children filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the railway, and the jury returned a judgment in their favor. An appeal was made by the railway, which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, leading to the railway seeking further review.

The plaintiffs' theory of recovery was based on several points: a) Norris's death was a direct result of injuries from the box car incident; b) the fall from the wagon was caused by the box car injuries and was also a direct cause of his death; c) Norris suffered various injuries due to the railway's negligence; d) all injuries from both incidents were the direct result of the railway's negligence.

The railway contested these theories and claimed that the injuries from the fall were the direct cause of death and were caused by an independent event not connected to the railway. Special issues were presented to the jury, which found that while the injuries from the box car did contribute to Norris's death, they were not the only cause, and the fall was not directly caused by the box car injuries.

The railway sought judgment based on the jury's responses and requested additional issues for the court to consider, which were denied. The railway contended that there had been an independent, subsequent cause of Norris's fall from the wagon and the resulting injuries that led to his death.","The court will reverse the judgments of the lower courts due to the failure of the jury to determine the proximate cause of death, which is critical in supporting the judgment. Despite the jury's answers to special issues indicating that the box car injuries contributed to Norris's death, these answers are not conclusive enough to establish either the box car or falls injuries as the proximate cause.

The railway's requested issue, which was to find the proximate cause of death in relation to the box car incident, should have been given, especially since the previous questions failed to facilitate the jury's decision-making regarding the evidence on this point. The case will be remanded for a new trial where this central issue, along with potentially others suggested by the evidence, should be properly addressed. There has been no affirmative finding indicating that the injury in the box car or the subsequent fall from the wagon were individually or jointly the proximate cause of Norris's death. Since there was no proper basis for the judgment against the railway without this finding, a new trial is warranted. The court makes no particular stance on the impact of the evidence or what issues it might raise for the new trial to avoid influencing the proceedings."
"A plaintiff mother, on behalf of herself and her infant daughter, brought a negligence lawsuit against an ultrasound technician and various companies after the technician allegedly produced a substandard ultrasound image. The mother had a history of a diagnosed short cervix and had received a cervical cerclage in a previous pregnancy to prevent premature delivery. However, the technician's measurement indicated that the mother's cervix was longer than it actually was, leading to the mother not being given a cerclage. As a result, the mother delivered prematurely, and her child, Toni Wright, suffered injuries. The child required extended hospitalization due to a congenital lung disease, often associated with premature birth. Eventually, Toni suffered severe brain damage at home due to a clogged breathing tube.

Daigle (technician) and her codefendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment, claiming a lack of proximate cause. The trial court granted the motion. The mother appealed, but the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision. The appellate court reviewed the case to determine if the evidence showed Daigle's actions were a proximate cause of the damages or if the sequence of events was too attenuated to connect Daigle's actions to the injuries sustained.

The summary judgment evidence included conflicting information about the ultrasound's adequacy and the quality of the resulting images. Radiologist Godwin, who issued a report to Givens' obstetrician, claimed to have conducted an independent review of the ultrasound films and did not rely on Daigle's measurements. He did not include cervical length in his report, stating it was well visualized in the images he reviewed.

The mother alleges a chain of causation that begins with the flawed ultrasound and leads to a series of events culminating in her daughter's brain damage due to oxygen deprivation from the clogged tube.","The verdict will uphold the summary judgment in favor of Daigle and the other defendants. The reasoning will be that Daigle’s alleged negligence in performing the ultrasound is too attenuated from the damages of medical expenses incurred during Toni's initial hospitalization and the subsequent brain damage. Although the ultrasound might have contributed to the premature birth, Daigle's actions do not rise to the level of proximate cause because they did not actively contribute to the ultimate injuries suffered by Toni, particularly the brain damage resulting from the clogged breathing tube, which occurred through a series of independent events too removed from Daigle's conduct.

The court will likely invoke the principle that cause in fact requires the negligent act to be a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, without which the harm would not have occurred. Because the radiologist's report did not rely on Daigle’s ultrasound and he made an independent assessment of the cervical length, the report cannot be seen as flowing directly from Daigle’s alleged negligent act. Furthermore, the ultrasound did not actively cause Toni's brain damage. The court will further note that other medical assessments occurred after the ultrasound, creating additional opportunities for the shortened cervix to be discovered. Hence, Daigle's actions, while possibly contributing to the premature birth, did not override subsequent medical decision-making in a manner that would establish legal causation.

In conclusion, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed, maintaining that Daigle and her co-defendants were correctly granted summary judgment based on the evidence presented."
"Ashlee Elizabeth Pagan was involved in a car accident in March 2008 when her truck was struck by another vehicle, causing various injuries including to her neck and left shoulder. She filed a lawsuit alleging that the driver of the other vehicle was negligent and sought coverage under her underinsured motorist insurance policy with Farmers Texas County Mutual Insurance Company. Farmers was added to the lawsuit after Pagan settled with the other driver. The key issues at trial were the cause and extent of Pagan's injuries.

Before the trial commenced, the court granted Pagan's motion in limine to prevent Farmers from referencing any injuries suffered post-2008 crash or an incident in April 2009 when Pagan was allegedly pushed down by a spooked horse. Pagan testified about the physical effects of the car accident, her hospital visit the following day, and her continuous pain in her neck and shoulder. Her boyfriend corroborated her account, detailing the negative impact of the crash on her abilities and participation in life activities. Pagan's orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Beaudry, associated her current shoulder problems with the crash and predicted she would need future shoulder surgery costing between $20,000 to $25,000.

Farmers attempted to present evidence relating to the April 2009 horse incident, arguing it was a potential cause of the injuries. However, Pagan successfully excluded this evidence, with the court finding no evidence that the horse incident caused her neck and shoulder injuries, suggesting it would only confuse the jury. The jury ruled in favor of Pagan, awarding her $50,000 in damages, which was offset by a $25,000 settlement from the driver of the car, resulting in a final judgment of $25,000 plus interest. Farmers appealed on the basis that the court abused its discretion in excluding evidence related to the horse incident and that the evidence supporting Pagan's injuries was factually insufficient.","Affirmed. The appellate court upheld the trial court's judgment, rejecting Farmers' contentions. It concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence related to the 2009 horse incident under Tex. R. Evid. 403 and 702. There was no showing by Farmers that the horse incident was a plausible cause of the injuries at issue. Even if causality between the incident and the injuries was considered, the proffered evidence was merely temporal correlations without substantive causation and could confuse the jury. Dr. Beaudry's opinion, although acknowledging a trampling could potentially cause similar injuries, was deemed as not based on the factual history of Pagan's case and therefore unreliable.

Farmers failed to prove a new causal explanation plausible enough to be presented to the jury, and any error in evidentiary exclusion was not harmful given the comprehensive testimonies provided by Pagan and her medical experts. The evidence of Pagan reporting neck and shoulder problems post-crash, alongside Dr. Beaudry's testimony linking the issues to the crash, was factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Statements made by Dr. Beaudry during deposition about the potential of a horse trampling causing similar injuries were speculative and did not offer a concrete alternative cause. The testimony was appropriately excluded to prevent the jury from speculating based on limited and non-probative information that could mislead the deliberation process.

Farmers' appeal focused heavily on the potential causal link between the 2009 horse incident and Pagan's injuries, but the appellate court found the evidence Farmers sought to introduce was speculative and not directly relevant to the specific injuries for which Pagan sought damages. The verdict did not depend on this excluded evidence, and the jury was entitled to rely on the evidence that was properly admitted under the rules of evidence. Therefore, Farmers' arguments were overruled, and the trial court's judgment was affirmed."
"The deceased employee, Ben Lewis, worked for A. A. Greer as a plastering contractor and was engaged in tasks such as carrying plaster to workmen and moving equipment. On December 15, 1944, while carrying a mortar board up a stairway, he received a blow to the stomach, which caused immediate pain in his lower abdomen. Despite finishing his day's work, he did not return to work after that day and died on January 2, 1945. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was an appendiceal abscess.

The appellant, Lewis’s widow, initiated a suit to set aside an award of the Industrial Accident Board and to recover compensation benefits, asserting that Lewis's death was causally related to the blow he sustained at work. The jury found that the injury did not ""naturally result"" in Lewis’s death and that his death was not caused solely by disease. Lewis’s widow contended that the trial court erred by presenting two specific questions to the jury and argued that the jury's verdict was inconsistent.

The appellant's arguments included claims that:
1. There was an irreconcilable conflict in the jury's findings as the record presented only two alternatives: death caused in part by injury or death caused solely by disease.
2. The term ""naturally resulted"" was ill-defined and precluded the notion that there could be more than one cause of death. Furthermore, the given definition required the jury, if answering affirmatively, to state that the accident was the sole proximate cause of death.
3. The trial court's instruction regarding ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" excluded consideration by the jury of death from an injury that may have aggravated or accelerated a pre-existing disease.
4. The trial court made various errors in deciding what evidence was admissible, particularly in relation to medical records and expert testimony.
5. Errors in the court striking parts of hypothetical questions addressed to medical experts.

The insurer, appellee, denied that Lewis received accidental injuries within the scope of his employment, claiming that his death resulted from natural causes unrelated to his employment.","The court will uphold the judgment in favor of the insurer. It will affirm that the claimant's charge of the irreconcilable conflict is refuted by the finding that the injury did not naturally result in death. This finding alone will necessitate a verdict for the insurer, while the finding that Lewis's death was not caused solely by disease does not permit the claimant to recover without a causal connection between the injury and the death. The jury's findings, when considered together, provide a reasonable explanation that does not reflect an irreconcilable conflict.

Furthermore, the court will dismiss the concerns regarding the trial court's charge about the injury naturally resulting in Lewis's death. The court will conclude that the objection to the charge made by the appellant was not preserved for review as it was not raised before the verdict and judgment were delivered.

As for the evidentiary issues pointed out by the appellant, the court will determine that any potential errors were harmless as the jury found Lewis sustained an injury. The details that were excluded or limited during the trial were either cumulative of previously admitted evidence or not demonstrated to have substantially affected the trial's outcome.

Accordingly, the appellant's points of error concerning the jury's findings, the trial court's charge definitions, and decisions on the admissibility of evidence will be overruled. The initial trial court's judgment in favor of the insurer will be affirmed without the necessity for a new trial. The jury's answers and findings will be considered coherent and supportive of the judgment when construed as a whole, despite the efforts of the appellant to illustrate inconsistencies.

In conclusion, for the appellant to have been successful in her appeal, she would have needed to demonstrate that the jury's findings were irreconcilable or that the trial court's errors were sufficiently harmful to warrant a new trial. However, the appeal will fail on both accounts and the insurer will emerge victorious in the case."
"Mrs. Christina White, the deceased, was a patient of Dr. Bruce Scaff. She was 38 years old, had undergone a kidney transplant as a teenager, and was suffering from stage four renal insufficiency at the time of the events in question. On September 26, 2005, Mrs. White visited Dr. Scaff complaining of severe right leg pain. Dr. Scaff diagnosed her with a stress fracture and renal failure and prescribed Hydrocodone w/APAP 5/500 # 25. She returned to see Dr. Scaff on October 3, 2005, still in pain, and he additionally prescribed Oxycontin ER 20 m.g. # 50. Mrs. White also saw a kidney specialist as per the referral from Dr. Scaff. On October 6, 2005, after taking the medications, Mrs. White became ill and briefly went to the hospital. She died at home on October 8, 2005. The cause of death reported in the autopsy was the ingestion of Oxycontin and Hydrocodone.

The appellants, acting as representatives for Mrs. White’s estate and others, filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Scaff, implying that the prescriptions he provided were improperly dosed given Mrs. White's renal condition, leading to lethal levels of narcotics in her blood and her subsequent death by overdose. They introduced expert testimony from Dr. Clive Fields and Dr. Horacio Adrogue, asserting that Dr. Scaff breached the standard of care, which included asserting that Mrs. White's leg pain was misdiagnosed and that the real cause was her statin medication, not a stress fracture. As a result of Dr. Scaff's prescriptions of Hydrocodone and Oxycontin, which were reportedly too high due to her renal insufficiency and also because the combination of these drugs without adjusting their dosage is highly toxic, Mrs. White's death ensued. The trial court excluded the testimonies of the expert witnesses and granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Dr. Scaff, suggesting that there was a lack of expert evidence to show causation in Mrs. White's death due to the excluded testimonies.","In predicting the outcome of the appeal, the appellate court will likely reverse the trial court’s decision to exclude the expert testimonies of Dr. Fields and Dr. Adrogue. The appellate court will find that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the expert testimonies, which were indeed based upon reliable evidence and thus, met the admissibility requirements under Tex. R. Evid. 702. The expert testimonies were grounded in scientific knowledge that was anchored in the methods and procedures of science, and they were designed to assist the trier of fact in making a determination on a key issue in the case—whether Dr. Scaff's prescription practices for a patient with severe renal insufficiency constituted a breach of standard of care that led to Mrs. White’s death.

The appellate court will determine that Dr. Fields and Dr. Adrogue are both qualified experts whose insights were based on a combination of scientific reports (autopsy and toxicology), medical literature, personal experience, as well as the principles of pharmacokinetics and the specifics of renal insufficiency's impact on drug metabolism. They both utilized differential diagnosis in making their medical determinations, a technique acknowledged and valid for reliability analysis, and their foundational data included medical records, pharmaceutical records, autopsy and toxicology reports, and established medical literature, which concede no significant potential rate of error.

Furthermore, the appellate court will dismiss the summary judgment granted to Dr. Scaff because, upon consideration of the expert testimonies, there is more than a scintilla of evidence, when reviewed in the light most favorable to the appellants, to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning Dr. Scaff's negligence and the causation of Mrs. White’s death. The summary judgment will also be overturned on issues regarding negligence in diagnosing the leg pain and the misprescription of Oxycontin and Hydrocodone. However, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment regarding the appellants’ lack of claims on gross negligence and punitive damages, as the appellants have stipulated they would not seek these damages and provided no evidence to suggest gross negligence.

The case, consequently, will be remanded to proceed with the witnesses' testimonies admitted for consideration in further proceedings, except for the affirmed part related to gross negligence and punitive damages."
"The appellant driver, Stanley Gene Hale, was involved in a car accident in Dallas County, Texas, where he collided with Jerome Leon Scruggs's vehicle. The accident occurred on Central Expressway near the University Boulevard Overpass around 1:00 A.M. The weather was clear, and the location was well-lit. Following the impact, Scruggs's Chevrolet was flipped upside down, and Hale's Oldsmobile was blocking the right lane. At the time of the collision, Hale was under the influence of alcohol and later pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated. Appellee rescuer D. L. Burgess, a Dallas Police Department officer, responded to the accident scene. Attempting to prevent further accidents, Burgess directed incoming traffic around the collision site. During this effort, Burgess was struck by another vehicle and sustained serious injuries. He sued Hale for personal injuries based on Hale's alleged negligence, attributing proximate cause of his injuries to the negligent collision.

Hale filed a plea of privilege to be sued in Grayson County, the county of his residence. Burgess filed a controverting plea insisting that venue was proper in Dallas County. The court overruled Hale's plea of privilege. In his challenge to the trial court's order, Hale argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings that (1) he committed a negligent act or omission in Dallas County, and (2) his negligent act or omission was a proximate cause of Burgess’s injuries. Burgess claimed that Hale (a) failed to keep a proper lookout, (b) failed to apply brakes on time, (c) drove at unreasonable speed, (d) didn't steer away to prevent collision, and (e) was intoxicated. The positioning of the vehicles post-collision posed a hazard to oncoming traffic, necessitating diversion of vehicles to prevent further incidents. The trial court's findings considered Hale's drunkenness, the positions of the vehicles, the efforts of Burgess to direct traffic, and the rescue doctrine.","The court will affirm the judgment that overruled appellant driver's plea of privilege, finding the evidence factually sufficient to show that the collision was proximately caused by one or more negligent acts committed by Hale. The court will refer to principles of the rescue doctrine, which stipulate that the proximate cause of injury to a rescuer who reasonably intervenes to aid persons in imminent peril due to another's negligence is the negligence that elicited the peril, not the rescuer's intervention.

The court will analyze the evidence, including Hale's intoxication, the subsequent positioning of the vehicles, the dangerous condition created, Burgess's response, and the nexus between Hale's negligence and Burgess's resultant harm. It will take into account the standard that the evidence must reveal the likelihood that Hale's negligence – mainly failing to keep a proper lookout, excessive speed, failure to brake, failure to steer clear, and driving while intoxicated – directly led to the accident and created the perilous situation addressed by Burgess.

The court will support its decision with Texas jurisprudence such as the Shultz v. Dallas Power & Light Co. and Longacre v. Reddick cases, recognizing the rescue doctrine as well as supplemental authorities like Restatement of Torts, reinforcing the notion that the negligence causing the rescue situation, not the act of rescuing, is the proximate cause of the rescuer's injuries.

Accordingly, the court will affirm the order overruling Hale's plea of privilege on the grounds that the evidence of negligence on his part as the proximate cause of Burgess's injuries is both legally and factually sufficient, with the rescue doctrine underscoring the legal rationale for attributing proximate cause to Hale's actions."
"William E. Jordan, the appellee (insured), filed a lawsuit against Combined American Insurance Company, appellant (insurer), to recover benefits under an accident, hospitalization, and indemnity insurance policy issued by the insurer. The trial court, without a jury, ruled in favor of the appellee, awarding him a total of $1,090.00 for benefits, plus a $130.00 statutory penalty and $500.00 in attorneys' fees. 

The insurance policy specified that benefits were recoverable for loss resulting ""directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injuries"" and not in any way caused or contributed to by disease. On October 6, 1964, the appellee, a 68-year-old man employed by his son, suffered an accidental bodily injury while lifting a machine component at work, resulting in a volvulus of his small intestine. Prior to this, the appellee had undergone two major surgeries for cancer of the colon, which left him with a significant amount of abdominal adhesions.

The insurer appealed the decision, contesting that the appellee's condition was caused by the combination of the injury and pre-existing abdominal adhesions. The appeals court initially reversed the trial court's judgment and rendered a judgment for the appellant insurer, concluding that the appellee could not prove his incapacity was caused solely by an accidental injury. Citing Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Ass'n. vs. Hudman, the appeals court asserted that the injury must be the sole cause of the condition to be covered by such a policy—with no concurring disease condition contributing to the disability.

On motion for rehearing, the court revisited their decision, particularly with respect to a separate ""dividend certificate,"" which offered different coverage without the same restrictions as the policy. The certificate provided benefits for accidental bodily injuries not caused by disease, but without requiring exclusivity of the accident as the cause, unlike the policy. Based on the distinction between the policy and the certificate, the court held that the more restrictive limitations of the policy did not apply to the certificate.","The court will determine its verdict based on the differing terms of the insurance policy and the dividend certificate. Regarding the insurance policy, the court will uphold the decision that the appellee cannot recover because he could not unequivocally prove that his incapacity was caused solely by an accidental injury, as required by the policy. The presence of pre-existing abdominal adhesions will be considered as a contributing factor, thus not satisfying the terms of the policy that require an injury to be the sole cause of the condition.

Regarding the dividend certificate, the court will rule in favor of the appellee, finding that he is entitled to benefits. As the certificate does not contain the restrictive provision found in the policy—that injuries be sustained ""independently of all other causes""—the coexistence of the accidental injury and the pre-existing abdominal adhesions will not preclude recovery under the certificate. 

The medical testimony indicated the accidental injury was the primary and proximate cause of the bodily injury, while the adhesions made the appellee more susceptible to the condition; this, the court will conclude, falls within the coverage of the certificate. The court will affirm recovery under the dividend certificate (but not under the policy) and remand the case for a new determination on reasonable attorneys' fees and the amount of statutory penalty, reflective of the affirmed portion of coverage under the dividend certificate only. 

As a result, the appellee will receive the affirmed award under the certificate, but the take nothing judgment will stand in relation to the insurance policy claims due to the concurrent causation of pre-existing adhesions and the accidental injury."
"Macedonia Baptist Church (the appellant) has appealed a judgment entered against it, where Nora Gibson (an injured member of the church) and her husband, Milton Gibson (the appellees), recovered damages for injuries sustained by Mrs. Gibson due to a side flash from lightning while she was leaving a worship service. The church began building a new structure in 1984 and ordered a steeple with a lightning rod and cable, intended to protect the building from lightning strikes. The contractor installed the steeple but was dismissed before completing the lightning rod and cable installation, which was then carried out by church members. They deviated from the installation instructions in several ways.

On August 21, 1988, during a lightning storm, Nora Gibson was injured by a side flash caused by lightning striking the rod system as she departed from the church service. The church is a nonprofit membership corporation and argued that it should have defenses from suits by members similar to those of unincorporated associations. This argument was about whether the Gibsons, as members, had standing to sue the church.

The case dealt with several legal questions including standing to sue, the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury’s decision, the exclusion of testimony of an undesignated witness, the propriety of jury argument, and the church's request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The evidence presented at trial showed that the church was aware of prior lightning strikes, that the system was improperly installed near a walkway, and that injuries from a side flash were foreseeable. Expert testimony supported the notion that the improperly installed lightning protection system was the most probable cause of Gibson’s injuries, contrasting with the church's stance that Gibson's injuries were an ""act of God."" Additionally, the court excluded testimony from a potential witness, Shirley Stark, who was not properly designated before trial and whose knowledge was related to Gibson's proximity to the ground wire at the time of the injury—a crucial detail given that proximity to the wire was necessary for a side flash to cause injury.","The court will uphold the lower court’s judgment in favor of the Gibsons, ruling that they indeed have standing to sue the church despite being members. The verdict will reflect that the injury was not an unavoidable ""act of God"" but was instead caused by an improperly installed lightning protection system—therefore, a foreseeable risk for which the church was responsible.

The testimony and evidence regarding the installation of the protection system and the conditions leading to the side flash will be deemed factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding that the church’s deviation from the system’s installation plan was negligent and led to Gibson's injuries. An additional factor in the verdict will involve ruling out the church's claim that it cannot be held responsible for acts of God due to the church's human intervention in installing the system and redirecting the lightning path.

Regarding the exclusion of Stark’s testimony, the court will agree with the initial ruling as Stark was not appropriately designated before trial as a witness with knowledge of relevant facts, and no good cause was shown for this oversight.

The jury argument presented by the Gibsons’ attorney may have had instances deemed improper by the court, but the verdict will state that Macedonia Baptist Church did not establish that these errors might have influenced the jury's decision to the extent that they should reverse the judgment.

Lastly, the church’s request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence will be denied because the evidence was not sufficiently material or likely to lead to a different outcome. In sum, the verdict will cite that the church failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion or that the probability of harm from improper jury argument outweighed the grounding of the verdict in the trial evidence. As a result, the church's various contentions will be overruled and the lower court's decision will be affirmed."
"The case centers around a dispute over the payout of a life insurance policy following the death of the insured, M. E. Glass. Glass passed away on April 14, 1900, while undergoing a surgical operation for appendicitis during which chloroform, an anesthetic administered by a regular physician, was used, and he was under its influence at the time of death. The insurance policy, provided by Maryland Casualty Company, contained a provision that excluded coverage for injuries caused by poison or anything taken, administered, absorbed, or inhaled, with an exception for anesthetics administered by a regular physician. The policy stipulated that it would pay out if death resulted from bodily injuries sustained through external, violent, and accidental means, independent of all other causes, within ninety days of the accident that caused the injury. Glass' wife, Mrs. Eula L. Glass, filed a suit to recover the proceeds of the policy.

During the trial, the evidence presented demonstrated that Glass was severely ill with appendicitis, which was at such an advanced stage that without surgery, his death was imminent. The operation was urgently conducted in hopes of saving his life. However, Glass never regained consciousness after being administered chloroform and died on the operating table, before the surgery could be completed.

Key testimony revealed that Glass was in very poor condition prior to the operation, exhibiting signs of septicemia (blood poisoning) due to the burst appendix, which had rendered him in a state of shock and with a very low vitality. Expert witnesses could not conclusively state that the administration of chloroform was the sole independent cause of death, but rather suggested that appendicitis and the anesthetic were concurring factors contributing to his demise.","Based on the policy's terms and the evidence presented, the verdict in favor of the wife claiming the insurance payout would likely be reversed. The burden of proof was on Mrs. Glass to show that the cause of death was due to the chloroform independently of all other causes. The detailed testimonies from medical experts indicated that while chloroform may have been a contributing factor, it was not the sole cause of death. The insured was already in a critical condition due to appendicitis and septicemia, conditions that were likely to lead to his death irrespective of the chloroform administration.

Given the evidence, it can be predicted that the appeal court would find that there was no evidence that decisively supported the conclusion that chloroform was the independent cause of Mr. Glass's death. Furthermore, the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that appendicitis, a pre-existing condition, played a significant role in his death. Therefore, the insurance company would not be liable under the terms of the policy since the death did not result from chloroform independently of all other causes. The case would likely be reversed and remanded due to the lack of evidence to support the original verdict in favor of Mrs. Glass."
"Lance Windrum, a 46-year-old man, experienced a disorienting episode in a parking lot on February 3, 2010, which included slurred speech and confusion. He also hit his head while getting into his car. An ambulance took him to North Cypress Medical Center (NCMC), where he underwent a CT scan and MRI, which led to a referral to Dr. Harpaul Gill, a neurologist at NCMC. Lance tested positive for Benzodiazepines. Lance reported three similar episodes in recent months, albeit milder ones. Additionally, he had a history of encephalitis as a child.

Dr. Gill diagnosed Lance with compensated obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis and referred Lance to Dr. Victor Kareh, a neurosurgeon, for further treatment, asserting that a shunt was required. Dr. Kareh evaluated Lance but did not review his medical history thoroughly. Lance was not experiencing symptoms at the time Dr. Kareh saw him. Instead of inserting a shunt, Dr. Kareh placed a ventricular drain to monitor intracranial pressure for 24 hours. Monitoring showed no immediate abnormal pressure, so no shunt was installed, although Dr. Kareh anticipated a future need for one.

Lance had another episode on February 15, 2010, and further MRI and EEG testing in April 2010 showed worsening aqueductal stenosis. However, these results, nor the symptoms from the most recent episode, were communicated to Dr. Kareh. Lance died in his sleep on May 2, 2010. An autopsy by Dr. Morna Gonsoulin found hydrocephalus complications caused by aqueductal stenosis as the cause of death.

Tracy Windrum, Lance's wife, filed a negligence suit against Dr. Kareh, claiming that his failure to install a shunt caused Lance's death. The jury found Dr. Gill and Dr. Kareh negligent, assigning 20 and 80 percent fault, respectively, and awarded significant damages to Windrum and her minor children. The trial court upheld the jury's verdict and awards. 

Dr. Kareh appealed, challenging both the breach of standard of care's legal and factual sufficiency and causation leading to Lance's death. The appellate court concluded plaintiff's expert's testimony was conclusory and the negligence too remote to constitute proximate cause. Thus, the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment. The plaintiff petitioned for review in the Texas Supreme Court.","The expert testimony will be deemed not conclusory. The jury will be deemed to have had the authority to determine the persuasiveness of Dr. Parrish's expert opinion over other experts, considering the extensive evidence from Lance's medical records, Dr. Parrish's own experience with hydrocephalus patients, and the testimony of both Dr. Dragovic and Dr. Kareh which supported the presence of hydrocephalus. There will be no expectation that every aspect of Dr. Parrish's conclusion be supported by medical literature, as the combination of his expertise, Lance's medical history, and the observations of Lance's symptoms will provide a sufficient basis for the opinion. The foreseeability and substantial factor tests will support a determination that a neurosurgeon presented with such symptoms and MRI results would have known to insert a shunt. 

As for proximate cause, the jury will be found to have sufficient grounds to determine that Dr. Kareh's negligence, in failing to treat the obstructive hydrocephalus properly, was a substantial factor in Lance Windrum's death. The direct causal link between Dr. Kareh's breach of duty in not installing a shunt and Lance's death by obstructive hydrocephalus will be established to a reasonable medical probability. Assertions that the negligence was not the ""immediate cause"" will be rejected, as Texas law recognizes that a negligent act need not be the sole cause of an injury, just a substantial factor. 

Finally, the appellate court will be found to have erred in its application of the standard for factual sufficiency review. Although it recited the correct standard, the court of appeals failed to detail the evidence and explain why the jury's verdict was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence or manifestly unjust. Therefore, a remand will be required for the appellate court to apply the factual sufficiency standard correctly or to determine if the plaintiff presented legally and factually sufficient testimony to support the jury's verdict, in accordance with the guidance provided."
"Infant Olivia Marie Coats (Olivia) died shortly after her birth. Her parents, Rachel Ann Melancon and Trent Allen Coats, filed wrongful death claims against Dr. George Backardjiev, Melancon's obstetrician, and the Medical Center, where Olivia was born. The allegations included negligence and gross negligence in the administration of Pitocin and use of forceps during delivery, which they claimed resulted in Olivia's hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and subsequent death.

During labor and delivery, Pitocin, a medication to stimulate labor, was administered. At one point, nurses questioned the continued use of Pitocin and use of forceps, exhibiting behavior indicating a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Despite these concerns and the appearance of severe fetal heart rate decelerations, Pitocin was continued, and forceps delivery was attempted. Following unsuccessful forceps attempts, a C-section was decided upon. Dr. Backardjiev used substantial force during the attempted forceps delivery, resulting in multiple skull fractures to Olivia.

Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Akin, offered testimony on the standard of care and causation. Dr. Akin testified that the increased use of Pitocin was inappropriate given the concerning evidence on the fetal monitoring strip and that the HIE was caused by the inadequate oxygenation of Olivia in utero. He also believed that the use of forceps contributed to severe skull fractures and HIE, but did not itself cause the HIE.

The jury found that the negligence of Dr. Backardjiev and the Medical Center proximately caused Olivia's death, assigning 95% responsibility to Dr. Backardjiev and 5% to the Medical Center. Damages of over $10 million were awarded.

The Medical Center moved for a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) arguing no competent evidence existed tying the acts or omissions of Medical Center employees to Olivia’s death, and that Dr. Akin was not qualified to express causation opinions on neurologic damage. The trial court denied the JNOV, and the Medical Center appealed.","The background demonstrates that Dr. Akin, based on his extensive experience and training as an obstetrician and gynecologist (ob-gyn), was qualified to opine on the causal relationship between labor, delivery, and resulting complications, including neurological injuries. His testimony did not rely solely on the fetal monitoring strip but incorporated the fetal blood gases at delivery and the clinical manifestations of HIE post-delivery, thus providing a reliable basis for his opinions.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that Dr. Akin's testimony was reliable. His opinions were not based solely on subjective interpretation but were supported by his expertise in obstetrics and gynecology, his understanding of fetal monitoring, and the administration of Pitocin. Furthermore, he was familiar with the expected course of managing labor and delivery, including the use of forceps. Therefore, his testimony about the cause of the infant's HIE was grounded in recognized scientific principles and his considerable professional experience.

The jury's verdict held both Dr. Backardjiev and the Medical Center responsible for Olivia's death. Given the evidence presented, specifically Dr. Akin's testimony, the jury could reasonably conclude that the continued administration of Pitocin, against indications of fetal distress, and the attempted forceps delivery were significant factors contributing to Olivia's HIE and death. Additionally, the jury could find that the Medical Center, through its employees, breached the standard of care by not adequately responding to the signs of fetal distress and negligently administering Pitocin, which contributed to Olivia's HIE.

Given that the appeal did not show an error in the trial court's findings regarding expert qualifications or testimony reliability, the appellate court will affirm the trial court’s determination on the verdict. The Medical Center's arguments for JNOV lack merit because the expert testimony provided by Dr. Akin was found to be both reliable and based on a reasonable medical probability sufficient to establish causation. The trial court did not err in denying the Medical Center’s motion for JNOV and the appellate court will hold that the judgment against the Medical Center should be affirmed."
"The City of Tahoka (plaintiff) filed a property damage lawsuit against Keystone-Fleming Transport, Incorporated (defendant), following an incident involving two of the company's trucks. The trucks, carrying tanks of liquid gas, collided in Lynn County, eventually leading to a fire and subsequent explosion that damaged one of the city's fire trucks. Seeking the transfer of the lawsuit, the transportation company filed a plea of privilege to move the case to Lubbock County, where it claimed residence and principal place of business. The city filed a controverting affidavit to oppose this, citing venue statutes that would allow the case to remain in Lynn County.

During the incident that led to the lawsuit, a collision between the defendant's trucks caused a fire early in the morning of April 26, 1953. This event led to the deaths of both drivers and damage to the city's fire truck, which arrived to help extinguish the fire. No eyewitnesses to the events leading up to the fire survived to provide testimony. The only direct evidence came from J. W. Clinton, fire chief of the City of Tahoka, who arrived on the scene before the fire truck and from J. C. Fleming, secretary-treasurer of Keystone-Fleming Transport. Fleming's testimony included speculation about the events leading to the accident and aspects based on hearsay regarding the cause of the subsequent explosion.

The trial court overruled the transportation company's plea of privilege, which prompted an appeal. There was a question of whether there was any evidence that the company had agents or a principal office in Lynn County, as well as whether the company's drivers committed an active trespass or crime in Lynn County, which would affect the legal jurisdiction for the case. The city was attempting to prove negligence on the part of the company's drivers under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur—meaning ""the thing speaks for itself""—which relies on the inference that the accident would not have happened had proper care been taken, due to the exclusive control of the instrumentality which caused the accident. However, the city could not establish specific acts of negligence and this reliance on inferred negligence lacked direct evidence.","Predicting a future verdict, the appellate court will likely reverse the trial court’s decision and render judgment in favor of transferring the case to Lubbock County. This is because the plaintiff has not satisfactorily proven that the defendant maintained a principal office or had an agent in Lynn County. Under Subdivision 23 of the venue statute, this would be necessary to establish appropriate venue in Lynn County. Furthermore, the plaintiff has not successfully demonstrated an active trespass or crime by the defendant’s drivers in Lynn County as required under the former Subdivision 9 of the venue statute for the case to be heard there.

In addition, the plaintiff's reliance on res ipsa loquitur will not hold as the evidence provided does not sufficiently lead to the belief that negligence occurred, nor does it show that the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the harm at the time of the accident. The lack of direct evidence means the plaintiff is relying on hearsay and speculative theories, which do not meet the necessary legal standards of proof for negligence or active trespass. To exemplify, the simultaneous occurrence of a fire and subsequent explosion as distinct accidental events cannot lead to the presumption of negligence without concrete evidence.

Given these circumstances, it is likely the court will hold that the plaintiff failed to refute the defendant’s plea of privilege by not establishing that the incident occurred as a result of the defendant’s negligence or a crime committed within the proper venue. Therefore, the appellate court's expected judgment will render the defendant's plea of privilege to be sustained, leading to the transfer of the lawsuit to the District Court of Lubbock County."
"The plaintiffs in this case are the survivors and fiduciaries of Elizabeth Pena and Jennifer Ertman, two teenage girls who were sexually assaulted and murdered by gang members during a gang initiation ceremony. The plaintiffs are suing Phan Son Van, the owner of P-One Food Store, for negligence, gross negligence, and negligence per se. The defendant, Phan Son Van, is being accused of selling alcohol to the assailants who were minors or visibly intoxicated at the time they made the purchase. The violation of the Tex. Alco. Bev. Code §§ 2.02 and 106.03 is the basis for the negligence claims.

The plaintiffs allege that the defendant was negligent in the sale of alcohol to the underage assailants and claim that this act of negligence was a proximate cause of the subsequent assault and murder of the two girls. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that his conduct did not proximately cause the girls' deaths because the assailants' criminal actions were an unforeseeable, superseding cause. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds, and the case was severed with the plaintiffs appealing the decision.

The defendant's supporting evidence for the summary judgment motion includes the victims' autopsy reports, assailants' indictments, judgments of conviction for capital murder, and excerpts from the testimony at the criminal trial. The plaintiffs responded by arguing that the defendant did not exclude the sale of alcohol as a proximate cause, contending that proximate cause is a fact issue, and presenting criminal trial testimony excerpts indicating that the gang members were ""all hyper and drunk,"" ""all worked up,"" and ""getting out of control"" before the crime took place.","The appeal court is expected to reverse the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Phan Son Van, and remand the case for further proceedings. In overturning the summary judgment, the court will likely reason that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the sale of alcohol to the minors and visibly intoxicated assailants by the defendant proximately caused the murders of Elizabeth Pena and Jennifer Ertman. 

The court will likely find that proximate cause, composed of cause in fact and foreseeability, cannot be resolved by mere speculation or as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. For the defendant to have been granted summary judgment, he would have to incontrovertibly prove that there was an absence of foreseeability, implying that no person of ordinary intelligence could have anticipated the danger created by the negligent act, and that the assailants' criminal conduct was unforeseeable and therefore a superseding cause of the deaths. However, the defendant’s evidence merely establishes that the crimes occurred and fails to negate foreseeability.

Given that the defendant provided judgments of conviction and evidence that the meeting was chance-based and did not affirmatively demonstrate the unforeseeability of the criminal acts following the sale of alcohol, the defendant did not fulfill his burden at the summary judgment phase. The court will emphasize the need for a practical, common experience-based inquiry into whether a person of ordinary intelligence could have anticipated the general nature of the harmful conduct that followed the consumption of liquor by the minors. 

Thus, the court will rule that this is a disputed fact issue that should be determined by a jury at trial. The plaintiffs are likely to be allowed to proceed to trial to prove that the defendant’s sale of alcohol to the assailants was a substantial factor and a foreseeable result of which the assault and murders would not have otherwise occurred. The reversal will be based on the perspective that foreseeability and causation are intensely fact-specific inquiries that are commonly reserved for a jury's assessment, rather than for determination by the court as a matter of law."
"Dr. Emily Archer, a gynecologist, began treating Anita Warren in 1988 for pelvic pain, and successfully performed a hysterectomy surgery. In a 1990 examination, Anita complained of symptoms indicative of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which was diagnosed as such by Dr. Archer. Anita's condition included a cystocele, a herniation of the bladder through the vaginal wall, which was noted to have progressed by 1993. During a 1995 examination, Dr. Archer discovered Anita's condition had further advanced, leading her to recommend surgery to correct the cystourethrocele (bladder herniation involving the urethra), a rectocele (herniation of the rectum through the vaginal wall), and the SUI. Dr. Archer did not discuss Kegel's exercises with Anita — exercises intended to strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Post-surgery, Anita developed nerve damage in her right leg causing persistent pain.

Anita and her husband filed a suit against Dr. Archer alleging medical negligence. Their claim centered on four main points: (1) the doctor failed to offer the non-surgical option of Kegel's exercises, (2) Anita would have chosen and performed the exercises if offered, (3) Kegel's exercises probably would have corrected her incontinence without surgery, and (4) surgery could have been avoided, thus preventing nerve damage.

The trial jury found Dr. Archer's negligence to be a proximate cause of Anita's injury, and the judgment was entered in favor of the Warrens for damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest. Dr. Archer appealed, contending the evidence was legally insufficient to support the findings of negligence and proximate cause, among other issues. Emphasis was placed on the legal insufficiency of evidence that Kegel's exercises would have likely prevented surgery.","The appeal from Dr. Archer will highlight the insufficiency of evidence regarding whether Anita would have successfully avoided surgery through the performance of Kegel's exercises. Focusing on causation, Dr. Archer will assert that there is no conclusive evidence supporting the notion that Anita, as an individual with her specific conditions, would have probably improved with Kegel's to a degree that surgery would be unnecessary. This assertion hinges upon a lack of specific criteria to identify patients who could actually be helped by Kegel's exercises and an expert's inability to predict reasonable medical probability of avoiding surgery through their use.

The court will likely find that the studies presented provided general statistics on SUI improvement with Kegel's exercises but failed to distinguish between the improvement levels necessary to forego surgery. The expert witness testimony will be scrutinized for relying on assumed facts not aligned with actual, undisputed facts of the case, rendering the testimony without probative value. 

Overall, the evidence will be determined to be legally insufficient due to its speculative nature and inability to establish a causal link between the failure to recommend Kegel's exercises and Anita's continued SUI and subsequent nerve damage with reasonable medical probability. As the proof offered did not meet the required standard of showing that the alleged negligence was a substantial factor in causing Anita's harm, and no criteria were provided to judge the likelihood of the exercises being a successful alternative to surgery for Anita specifically, the judgment in favor of the Warrens will be reversed. The court will predict that the outcome of the appeal will result in a new judgment that the Warrens take nothing."
"An appellant company, Tyler Mirror & Glass Company, and its driver, appealed a judgment from the 115th District Court, Wood County (Texas), which awarded damages to the appellee for personal injuries sustained in a collision with the appellants' truck. The appellee, Zodie Simpkins, along with her husband Ollie Simpkins, sued the appellant company and driver, Alan Mauldin, alleging negligence on part of Mauldin which led to the collision and various injuries on a specific date, August 14, 1963. The injuries claimed included head injuries, an arm fracture, cuts and abrasions on her legs, broken ribs, loss of eyesight due to the development of a traumatic cataract, colon and gall bladder trouble, as well as high blood pressure.

In the trial, the judge gave the standard jury charge, instructing them to award damages which were the direct and proximate result of the incident. The jury found against the defendants on the primary negligence issues, also ruling out contributory negligence and other issues for the plaintiffs, granting an award of $14,778.00 for damages sustained by Mrs. Simpkins and $1,400.00 for additional hospital, medical, and drug expenses.

The appellants did not contest their liability but claimed that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury regarding damages. They challenged that there was no evidence of causal connection between the accident and Ms. Simpkins' loss of eyesight, colon and gall bladder trouble, and/or high blood pressure, and that these issues should have been explicitly excluded from the jury's consideration when determining damages. They had requested written exclusionary instructions that the judge refused. The appellants sought a reversal and remand based on these alleged errors.

The court found that the medical testimony did not affirmatively state that the loss of eyesight, colon trouble, gall bladder trouble, and high blood pressure were, in reasonable medical probability, a result of the accident. Appellants contended that this went against established legal standards which require plaintiffs to prove a causal connection beyond mere speculation or conjecture, and that expert testimony is required to establish causation of diseases or injuries not common knowledge to laypeople.","The court will reason that because there was no evidence of probative force connecting Mrs. Simpkins' loss of eyesight, colon trouble, gall bladder trouble, and/or high blood pressure to the accident, the standard jury charge did not properly limit the jury's consideration of damages proximately caused by the collision. Given that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causal relation with respect to damages sought, the court will reverse the trial court's award of damages due to the lack of proper limitation in the jury's consideration for damages directly tied to the negligence of the defendants. 

This decision will be predicated upon several legal principles: a plaintiff must show causation for the specific injuries claimed, and proof is required beyond speculation or mere coincidence with the accident. Expert medical testimony is generally necessary to establish causation for complex medical conditions unknown to laypersons, and the causal connection must be established with evidence that allows for reasonable inference, especially in cases involving disease processes or complex medical conditions such as cataracts and high blood pressure.

The appellants' requested exclusionary instructions aimed to prevent the jury from considering the conditions unrelated to the accident regarding the award of damages. Since the trial court did not provide these instructions, and considering there was no probative evidence linking the injuries in question to the accident, the court will conclude that it was erroneous for the jury to assess damages for these conditions. Consequently, by not instructing the jury otherwise, the court permitted them to potentially base their award on non-proximate or unsubstantiated claims of injury, thus leading to the reversal of the judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings to limit damages to those proximately caused by the accident."
"The case involves the estate of Eugene Johnson, represented by the appellant administratrix, who brought a negligence action against Johnson County after Eugene Johnson hung himself with a mattress cover in his cell at the county jail. The central legal issue pertains to whether the county could be held liable under the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Section 101.021 for his death caused by a condition or use of property. The county asserted governmental immunity, which generally protects political subdivisions in Texas, including counties, from lawsuits unless there is an express waiver of such immunity. The key contention focused on whether the county's provision of a mattress cover to the decedent in his jail cell constituted ""use"" within the meaning of Section 101.021, which waives immunity for death caused by the use of property if a private person would be liable under similar circumstances.

The appellant attempted to distinguish this case from past precedents where governmental immunity was upheld by arguing that Johnson County did more than make the mattress cover available; it actively issued the bedding, locked Eugene Johnson in the cell and compelled him to use the mattress cover even though he was known to be suicidal. The appellant cited other precedents where liability was found when an entity provided insufficient protective measures (such as a hospital bed without side rails) or issued defective property that lacked safety features integral to protecting individuals known to be at risk. In contrast, Johnson County relied on precedents such as San Antonio State Hospital v. Cowan, where the hospital was not held liable for a patient's suicide using his own suspenders and walker, with the court determining that the hospital did not ""use"" the items within the meaning of Section 101.021.","Given the legal precedents and the statutory context, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment that Johnson County is protected by governmental immunity. The court will reason that the county cannot be held liable for Eugene Johnson's death because it did not engage in ""use"" of the mattress cover as contemplated by Section 101.021 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code. The county's act of providing a jail cell equipped with a mattress cover will be viewed as neither constituting a use of property by the county itself nor converting it into a private user. The court will conclude that merely allowing someone else (in this case, Eugene Johnson) to use the property does not meet the definition of ""use"" that would waive governmental immunity.

The decision will rely on the interpretation of past cases like Cowan and Texas A&M University v. Bishop, suggesting that a governmental unit does not ""use"" property merely by providing it to others. The appellant's arguments attempting to align this case with those that found liability when safety components were absent will not be persuasive. The court will determine that Johnson County did not take affirmative actions amounting to ""use"" in a manner proximately causing Eugene Johnson's death. Rather, the county's actions will be seen as analogous to the scenarios in Cowan and Bishop where ""use"" was narrowly construed, and immunity was not waived. The court will differentiate this case from those involving an entirely lacking integral safety component, indicating that the conditions do not fall within the ""outer bounds"" previously recognized for liability under similar statutes."
"Appellant power company was involved in a lawsuit initiated by appellees husband and wife following the electrocution and subsequent death of their son. The incident occurred when the husband sought to lift power lines, belonging to the power company, which were hanging low across an intersection and impeding the movement of a house they were assisting to move. After the husband received an electrical shock while attempting to lift the wires, the son went to his aid, caught hold of two wires, and was fatally electrocuted. The husband and wife alleged negligence on the part of the power company, asserting that it violated a local ordinance by not maintaining the wires at the required height of twenty-five feet above street level. Initially, judgment was awarded to the husband and wife by the trial court, a decision which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals but later reversed and remanded. The trial court's refusal to sustain the company's exception to the husband and wife's pleadings was called into question, as they had failed to allege the specific provisions of the local ordinance they claimed was violated. Additionally, it was necessary to prove both that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of a wrongful act and that it should have been foreseeable by the company. There was no evidence presented that indicated the awning where the incident occurred was ever used by anyone, thus suggesting that it was not foreseeable that someone would come into contact with the wires.","The court likely found that the appellees' allegations concerning the local ordinance were not sufficiently specific, as they did not include its provisions either in terms or substance. This lack of specificity meant that the trial court should have sustained the special exception filed by the power company. Furthermore, the power company could not reasonably have anticipated that someone would be on the awning and at risk of injury due to the exposed wires, since there was no evidence that the awning had ever been used by anyone else previously. The power company's duty of care did not extend to unforeseeable outcomes, and as such, there was probably no evidence of negligence contributing directly to the son's death that the jury could have used to find in favor of the husband and wife. An ordinarily prudent person would not have foreseen the risk presented by the wires because the awning was not intended for public access or use. The appellate court, therefore, likely determined that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury to find in favor of the power company, as an assessment of the evidence according to the standard of foreseeability and the specifics of the local ordinance indicated no actionable negligence by the power company. Consequently, the award of judgment to the husband and wife was likely reversed and the case remanded due to the error in not sustaining the company's exception to the pleadings, and due to the absence of evidence supporting a claim of negligence on the part of the power company."
"Roy Akers, owner of an ambulance service, instigated a lawsuit against Mrs. R. J. Epperson and her husband, seeking damages for a collision involving his ambulance and a car driven by Mrs. Epperson in San Antonio, Texas. The collision occurred near the intersection of San Pedro and Park Avenues when the ambulance, operated by J. P. Riley, collided with Mrs. Epperson's Dodge passenger car. The key issues in the case were the negligence of both drivers and the respective proximate cause of the collision.

During the trial, testimony was given indicating that the ambulance was traveling at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour before the collision, and evidence of skid marks 26 to 28 feet long on the pavement suggested the ambulance's speed at the time of braking. The skid marks became a significant point of contention in the trial. There was an assertion of jury misconduct raised by Akers, arguing that a juror, based on prior experience as a garage man, improperly influenced the jury by stating that the skid marks implied the ambulance was traveling at 40 miles per hour. Another point of contention was a juror visiting the scene of the accident, alleged to potentially influence his view of the case, although the claim was that the intersection had not changed since before the trial. Akers also challenged the jury's findings concerning whether the operator had proper control over the ambulance at the time of the collision, particularly against the jury's conclusion that the speed of the ambulance was a proximate cause of the collision.","The court will affirm the trial court's denial of recovery to the appellant, Roy Akers. In reaching this conclusion, the court will note that sufficient evidence supported the jury's findings of negligence and proximate cause regarding the speed of the ambulance operator. The skid marks on the pavement, along with the operator's testimony, will be viewed as substantial evidence to uphold the jury's verdict.

The court will reject Akers' argument concerning jury misconduct with respect to juror Boswell's opinion on the speed of the ambulance based on the skid marks. The court will find that jurors discussing evidence and drawing on personal experience is permissible, and Boswell's opinion will not be considered to carry undue expert weight, as jurors are allowed to consider evidence in light of their personal experiences, as long as no new evidence is brought into deliberations that was not presented in court. 

Regarding the visit to the accident scene, the court will determine that the juror's actions did not constitute misconduct, as he had not obtained any new information beyond what was already testified to during the trial. 

The court will also find no conflict in the jury's findings relating to the operator's control of the ambulance and the speed being a proximate cause of the accident. The reasoning will conclude that all the elements, including foreseeability and the situation of the injured party concerning the wrongful act, were appropriately considered by the jury. The court will determine that the ambulance's speed, even if it could not have been expected to lead to the precise incident that occurred, was reasonably anticipated to lead to a general type of injury under the circumstances.

Overall, the court will dismiss the appellant's contentions, upholding the lower court's judgment, and no new trial will be granted based on the arguments provided. The detailed evidence from the trial, juror behavior, and legal interpretation of negligence and proximate cause will all support this verdict."
"Courtney McKenzie-Thue, at the age of 33 and suffering from a rare cancer of the appendix, agreed to undergo a procedure called HIPEC at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. This procedure, undertaken as part of a clinical trial designed by Wake Forest Medical School, involved extensive surgery to remove visible cancer and a perfusion of the peritoneal cavity with chemotherapy drugs mixed with a carrier fluid. McKenzie-Thue was randomly selected to receive the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin, and pursuant to the trial protocol, the hospital used a sugar water solution (D5W) as the carrier agent. D5W can cause hyponatremia, which leads to swelling of cells, and to counteract this, the hospital administered an insulin and saline IV drip during surgery. Despite this, McKenzie-Thue developed brain swelling (due to hyponatremia) and died two days after surgery.

The McKenzie family alleged that the hospital was negligent in using D5W as it was not the appropriate fluid under the circumstances and posed a significant risk of serious harm leading to the condition from which McKenzie-Thue died. Dr. David Miller, the expert witness for the McKenzies, stated in his report that the misuse of fluid was the probable cause of death. The hospital filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting it was immune from suit, arguing (1) the D5W was used by an independent contractor, not the hospital, and (2) the harm was not foreseeable, precluding a proximate cause.

The trial court denied the hospital’s plea to the jurisdiction, and this was affirmed by the court of appeals. The hospital's appeal to the Texas Supreme Court focused on whether the negligence claim was premised on the improper use of the D5W property under the Texas Tort Claims Act and whether McKenzie-Thue's death was unforeseeable.","The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment that governmental immunity was waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act. The plaintiffs’ claim was established as being premised on the hospital's use of a carrier agent that was improper under the circumstances and caused harm, which was sufficient to establish negligent ""use"" under the Act. The use of D5W as a carrier agent in large doses exposed the patient to the risk of developing hyponatremia and resulting brain herniation and death, and this risk was known to the hospital, as evidenced by their precautionary measures.

Foreseeability did not require the hospital to anticipate the precise manner in which injury would happen. What was required was only that the general danger was foreseeable. Since the hospital knew D5W could cause hyponatremia and took measures to counteract it during the procedure, this indicated that it was aware of the risks and that the general dangers were foreseeable. Moreover, this knowledge did not make the risks of using the D5W unforeseeable.

The hospital cannot rely on a defense based on successfully administered precautionary measures to negate foreseeability since the measures taken did not eliminate the risk. As such, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the use of D5W proximately caused McKenzie-Thue’s death. Therefore, the case was remanded for further proceedings and the hospital was left subject to the claims of negligence due to their use of tangible personal property, D5W, in a medical treatment that led to McKenzie-Thue's death. The court’s decision took note of its role in determining immunity, not liability, and clarified that this decision did not automatically impose liability on the hospital for negligence, which would be a matter for a future fact-finder to decide."
"The case involves the City of Austin appealing the trial court's denial of its plea to the jurisdiction under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) concerning the death of Johnathon Aguilar, who was stabbed by Dylan Woodburn. Aguilar's representatives sought to recover damages, naming the City, the restaurant where the incident occurred, and the entities related to the duty belt worn by the police officer during the incident as defendants.

On January 3, 2020, an incident began at Bennu Coffee where Woodburn was disturbing customers, leading to him being restrained by customers after attacking one with a large object. Officer Patrick Spradlin from Austin Police Department (APD) responded to a ""suspicious person"" call regarding Woodburn. Upon arriving at Bennu, Spradlin directed customers to release Woodburn, who was then being held down, to handcuff him. During the attempt to handcuff Woodburn, Spradlin's duty belt became loose, and he paused to refasten it, at which point Woodburn got up and left the coffee shop.

Woodburn subsequently entered an adjacent restaurant called Freebirds, which had been left unlocked by its general manager, Ryan Bramlett. Inside Freebirds, Woodburn picked up a knife left on the counter by a vendor and fatally stabbed employee Aguilar. Appellees argued that the incident was connected to the failure of Officer Spradlin's duty belt, which should have contained ""keepers"" or other safety components according to APD policy, and that this failure and its use or misuse proximately caused Aguilar's death.

As a political subdivision of the State, the City of Austin is immune from suit and liability unless there is a waiver of immunity. The plaintiffs must allege a valid waiver of immunity such as the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA) by demonstrating that personal injury or death was proximately caused by the condition or use of tangible property. Proximate cause includes both cause in fact and foreseeability, where cause in fact regards whether the condition or use was a substantial factor leading to the injury without which it would not have occurred, and foreseeability pertains to whether one of ordinary intelligence should have anticipated the danger created by a negligent act or omission.

The City argued that the use or condition of the duty belt was too causally attenuated from Woodburn stabbing Aguilar to constitute a proximate cause of Aguilar's death. According to the City, the pleaded facts didn't create a fact question on either foreseeability or cause in fact, and other cited cases involved injuries that were the direct and foreseeable consequence of the safety components' failure.","The court will ultimately reverse the trial court's order, rendering judgment granting the City's plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing the appellees' claims against the City. It will be determined that Aguilar's death was not the natural and probable result of the duty belt's failure, and it wasn't reasonably foreseeable that the belt's failure could cause the harm Aguilar suffered. The connection between the duty belt's condition or use and Aguilar's death will be considered to be too attenuated and lacking causality. The injury Aguilar suffered will not be viewed as a foreseeable result of the duty belt’s failure, and the causal chain will be considered too indirect to establish liability under the TTCA.

The verdict will likely focus on the principle that governmental immunity protects the City unless there is a clear waiver per the TTCA, which applies to injuries caused by the condition or use of tangible property. The court will follow precedents that hold when injuries are too remote from the alleged but-for cause, the property’s condition or use is not the proximate cause as a matter of law. Appellees' allegations about the failure to use ""keepers"" or comply with APD policy in relation to the duty belt will not suffice to establish a direct and natural result of the injury that was foreseeable. The court will also likely conclude that the pleadings do not allow for sufficient facts to demonstrate jurisdiction and that factual scenarios presented do not warrant a different application of the relevant law. The court's reasoning will underscore the conceptual difference between the potential policy issues regarding Officer Spradlin's actions and the specific legal standards for property use under the TTCA, emphasizing that the duty belt's condition or use did not form a proximate cause of injury."
"The appellants, Gary Leroy Weidner and Liberty Cab Company, Inc., appealed a judgment from a personal injury suit in favor of the appellee, Matilde S. Sanchez, after a jury found them jointly and severally liable for her injuries and awarded damages exceeding her initial claim. The cab company had a contract with the Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority (Metro) to transport infirm and handicapped passengers. While driving Sanchez home from her doctor's appointment, cab driver Weidner ran a stop sign and collided with another vehicle. Sanchez walked home and later went to the emergency room, eventually seeking treatment for about six months for injuries that were claimed to be permanent.

Sanchez had initially sought $95,000 in damages in a civil court that had jurisdiction for claims up to $100,000. However, after a deposition revealed her injuries were permanent, Sanchez amended her pleadings to seek $210,000. The appellants raised multiple points of error, including the trial court's jurisdiction, motion for mistrial due to violations of a motion in limine, the denial of various post-verdict motions, the legal sufficiency to support the award, the amendment of pleadings, and the employment status of Weidner, which determined Liberty Cab's liability.","The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, detailing that the jurisdiction was properly established based on the original amount pleaded, which allowed Sanchez to seek prejudgment interest eo nomine. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reinstating the case after an accidental dismissal. Violations of the motion in limine were cured by the jury's instruction to disregard. 

Regarding the verdict's sufficiency, the awarded damages were substantiated by evidence from Sanchez and her doctor, supporting an award for both past and future damages, despite her death. The employment status of Weidner was determined to be that of an employee, not an independent contractor during the transaction at issue, due to compelling evidence showing Liberty Cab's control over his work as required by the contract with Metro. 

The amendment of pleadings post-verdict was permissible, and the trial court's making of findings of fact in a jury trial, while unnecessary, was not seen as reversible error. Lastly, the court found no cumulative error that would cause the rendition of an improper judgment, negating the appellants’ claim for a reversal based on such grounds."
"The case involves an action by Jeffrey Peace and Caroline Peace (the Peaces), who purchased real estate in the City of Westlake Hills, Texas (the City) from Amy Hovis for $635,000. Hovis had an oral agreement with the City to donate a fifteen-foot right-of-way for the expansion of a roadway on the property. The City agreed to partition Hovis's lot into two lots in exchange for the donation. The partition separated the lots to face opposite roads—101 McConnell Drive and 102 Westhaven Drive. This agreement was written in the August 20, 2011 city council meeting minutes, and approximately a month later, the City executed the partition.

The Peaces were not informed of the right-of-way agreement by Hovis, Independence Title Company (ITC), or the title company's agents, the McMahans, during the purchase. However, during the purchase-option period, the Peaces were made aware of the possibility of a roadway expansion through an email forwarded to them by Hovis's real estate agent. Despite this, they closed on the property without a formalized right-of-way agreement.

After the sale, the City sought to have the Peaces fulfill Hovis's oral promise; the Peaces declined. In 2013, the city voided the partition that divided the lots. The Peaces then sued ITC, the McMahans, and others for common law fraud, fraud by nondisclosure, conspiracy to commit fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). During the proceedings, the City initiated condemnation proceedings to acquire the needed land for the roadway, which occurred after the Peaces filed their suit.

ITC and the McMahans sought summary judgment on no-evidence and traditional grounds, contending that their failure to disclose the right-of-way did not cause the Peaces damages. The Peaces sought summary judgment on traditional grounds regarding the breach of fiduciary duty claim. The trial court granted ITC and the McMahans' summary judgment motions and denied the Peaces' partial summary judgment motion. The Peaces' inverse-condemnation claim against the City was tried to a jury, who awarded the Peaces $297,000. The final judgment incorporated the summary judgment orders and awarded the Peaces the inverse-condemnation damages according to the jury's verdict.","The verdict upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees (ITC and the McMahans). It was determined that the Peaces failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove any amount as damages. The Peaces did not present a quantifiable measure of damages, such as the value expended versus the value received, the difference between the value as represented and the value received, or whether such damages were foreseeable and directly traceable to the wrongful acts by ITC and the McMahans.

The court also noted that while the Peaces claimed they would not have purchased the property had they known of Hovis's oral promise, the cause of any damages to the Peaces was the subsequent governmental condemnation of part of their property for roadway expansion, not actions taken or omitted by ITC or the McMahans. Furthermore, the City always had eminent domain power relevant to the case, meaning that even without the defendants’ supposed wrongful acts, the taking of the land by the City would have been imminent, indicating no causation from the defendants’ actions.

Additionally, since the Peaces were compensated for the right of way by the City in the condemnation proceedings, this demonstrated that the alleged wrongful non-disclosure by ITC and the McMahans did not cause losses that were uncompensated.

Therefore, the Peaces' argument regarding breach of fiduciary duty was also unpersuasive, as it relied partly on the causation element which was already overruled. As the damages and causation elements are common to all six claims made by the Peaces and the court found no sufficient evidence of damages or causation due to the aforementioned reasons, the verdict was that the Peaces take nothing from ITC and the McMahans."
"** The individual plaintiff, Ward Longacre, was severely burned when trying to rescue J. T. Abbott, an employee of J. E. Reddick, from an ignited butane gas spill resulting from a collision of a Reddick-owned butane gas truck and another truck in Wichita County. Longacre sued Reddick and Abbott in Wichita County, asserting that Abbott had been negligent in driving on the wrong side of the road, which led to the collision and ultimately to Longacre's injuries while performing the rescue. Both defendants filed a plea of privilege to move the case to the county of their residence; the trial court overruled Abbott's plea but sustained Reddick's plea, ordering the case against Reddick to be moved to Dallas County. The trial court based its decision on two grounds: first, that any active trespass or crime committed by Abbott had ceased before Longacre attempted the rescue, as Abbott's truck had come to a full stop; second, that there was no negligence as between Reddick and Abbott and thus Longacre could only recover damages from Reddick if Abbott himself could have. The case was under review to determine whether Longacre had a cause of action against Reddick given the circumstances of the incident and the legal principles guiding such situations.

**","** The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court's reasoning will likely focus on the principle that an employer can be held liable for the negligent acts of their employee when those acts occur within the scope of employment and cause harm to a third party. The court is expected to find that Reddick, as the employer, is responsible for Abbott’s negligence because Abbott's negligence in causing the collision is imputed to Reddick. The court will likely determine that Longacre's rescue attempt was a foreseeable consequence of Abbott's negligence, which implies that Longacre's rescue effort and resulting injuries were natural and probable results of the situation created by the employee's negligence.

The court will probably reject Reddick’s contention that liability only arises if the rescued person has a cause of action against the defendant. Instead, the court is likely to hold that the liability is imposed due to the master-servant relationship and Abbott's actions being within the scope of his employment. This means Reddick can be held accountable for Longacre's injuries regardless of whether Abbott, who was rescued, could himself have maintained a cause of action against Reddick.

The court is also expected to clarify that whether the trespass or negligence has become passive is irrelevant because the immediate cause of the rescue effort—the burning truck—was directly connected to the original negligence act (the collision). The rescued person (Abbott) was in a position of peril due to Reddick’s employee’s (thus Reddick’s imputed) negligence, which proximately caused Longacre's injuries. The trial court's judgment will be overturned, and Longacre's plea to have Reddick’s plea of privilege overruled is likely to be granted, allowing the case to proceed in Wichita County as against Reddick."
"On August 21, 1997, Pearl Trevino, who was pregnant with her first child, woke up in the middle of the night experiencing symptoms that led her to believe she was going into labor. She was experiencing vaginal bleeding, frequent urination, and a lot of pain. Her mother drove her to Santa Rosa Hospital and registered her in the emergency room. While waiting, Trevino made several trips to the restroom. During her last trip, she yelled from the stall that she was in a lot of pain and that something was coming out. Trevino's mother informed Nurse Nichola Harlan of her daughter's condition, and Harlan replied that she would be there soon. A security guard, who had previously helped Trevino, went to check on her and upon seeing that the baby was coming out, alerted Harlan. Harlan proceeded to the restroom, saw the baby's head, asked the security guard to call for help, and assisted with the delivery. The baby was transported to the neonatal intensive care unit. Trevino was asked to walk from the restroom to a bed since the hospital bed could not fit through the restroom door, using a sheet to hold the umbilical cord, placenta, and fluids, while being half-naked and observed by a crowd that applauded her.

Trevino sued Santa Rosa Hospital and Harlan for intentional infliction of emotional distress, common law fraud, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and medical malpractice. At trial, directed verdicts were granted in favor of the defendants on all claims, which Trevino appealed. Regarding the emotional distress claim, the court held that Trevino did not show she suffered severe emotional distress. As for common law fraud, it was deemed that the nurse did not know her statement was false when made. Trevino did not establish that the hospital fully billed her for the infant’s labor and delivery to sustain the DTPA claims. Finally, due to her failure to offer expert testimony on proximate cause, her medical malpractice claim was also dismissed.","The appeals court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. As to the intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if Trevino could establish reckless conduct by the appellees, there was no evidence that she suffered severe emotional distress. In defining severe emotional distress, she needed to demonstrate that it was more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger, which she did not do. On the common law fraud claim, Trevino did not show that when the nurse made the statement about being there soon, she knew it to be false. For the DTPA claims, Trevino was unable to prove that the hospital's actions were unconscionable or that full billing took place without evidence of the hospital bill in the record. Additionally, the term ""goods"" in the DTPA did not apply to services offered to Trevino. Concerning the medical malpractice claim, Trevino was unable to establish the necessary proximate cause between the medical care received and the pain endured as she did not present expert testimony. Since she couldn't show with a reasonable medical probability that earlier triaging would have prevented her pain, expert testimony was crucial to her medical malpractice claim. The court emphasized that a plaintiff's failure to provide evidence on the element of proximate cause is fatal to maintaining a medical malpractice claim. Thus, the directed verdict was upheld, and the defendants prevailed on all claims raised by Trevino."
"A products liability case was brought to court involving plaintiff turkey grower and defendant feed supplier. The defendant sold and delivered turkey feed under the brand ""Master Mix"" to the plaintiff, with the expectation that the feed would be used to feed approximately 250,000 turkeys during the year 1963. The grower added nothing to the feed except for mixing it with milo according to the defendant's specific instructions. The defendant financed all turkey feed, poults, and medication and supported the feeding process with expert visits and inspections. 

After the feed was distributed to various locations over central Texas, the plaintiff's turkeys, which were consuming the Master Mix feed, began to exhibit signs of illness, such as loss of color, becoming ""droopy,"" and when dressed, emitting an unusual sour odor. These symptoms appeared simultaneously across diverse geographic areas among flocks that had only the feeding of Master Mix in common. The plaintiff sought the expertise of several professionals, who did not find disease to be the cause but recommended changing the feed. An experiment was conducted, where one group of turkeys was fed a competitive company's feed and displayed rapid improvement over the group that continued on Master Mix. The defendant's representative had expressed concerns about the performance of the turkeys. 

Numerous experts, both for the plaintiff and defendant, gave testimony regarding the turkeys' health, with diagnoses ranging from mycosis and bacterial infection to copper poisoning from Ema-sol, a product used in their water. Through these deliberations, the jury found that the Master Mix feed, containing 8.5% to 20% cottonseed meal, was harmful to the turkeys and it was the producing cause of the damages sustained. The defendant appealed, citing various points of error, including contractual disclaimers of warranty and effectiveness, and strict liability considerations.","The court affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff, concluding that the evidence provided, both direct and circumstantial, was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that the harm to the turkeys was a direct result of the cottonseed meal content in the Master Mix feed supplied by the defendant. The court upheld the rule of strict liability imposed on vendors of food products and dismissed the effectiveness of disclaimers on feed contracts that attempted to waive or limit liability. These contractual terms do not mitigate the vendor’s strict liability in the event harm is caused by the product unfit for its intended purpose. 

Furthermore, the court determined that the disclaimer on the back of the contract was ineffective. Citing the case of Vandermark v. Ford Motor Company and Linn v. Radio Center Delicatessen, the court maintained that waivers that deviate from public policy by releasing manufacturers from strict liability for delivering unwholesome food products are invalid. Additionally, the sale of unfit feed also violated Texas Commercial Feed Control Act of 1957, which set standards for feed production, and any anticipatory release or waiver for violations of such a penal statute is universally held to be void. 

Based on the detail and correlation of the evidence across numerous witnesses and expert testimonies, the jury's findings concerning the specific damages and causes were upheld as they were not against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Damages were calculated in detail and supported by the plaintiff's profit and loss statements, bank statements, industry growth charts, and other documents, which indicated the financial significance of the turkeys' weight loss and failed growth. Interest was awarded from January 15, 1964, which aligns with the rationale of providing complete indemnity for the injured party, and the jury's verdict was not deemed excessive given the detailed nature of the evidence provided for each component of the damage award.

The judgment against the defendant feed supplier was a product of thorough and corroborated evidence that pointed to the feed's harmful cottonseed meal content as the primary cause of the plaintiff turkey grower's damages, affirming the rule of strict liability."
"Paul Dew, an employee of one of Rowan Companies, Inc.'s associated companies, died after falling through an opening in an oil derrick platform known as the Gorilla V, which was under construction at the time. The Gorilla V, a multi-tiered offshore drilling rig, was designed by Woolslayer Companies, Inc., for use in the North Sea, with safety gates required around ladder openings. Rowan had hired Crown Derrick Erectors, Inc. to erect the Gorilla V from parts manufactured by Woolslayer, beginning construction in March 1998.

During the construction, Crown Derrick discovered missing parts necessary for installing safety gates around one ladder opening on the fourble platform. Upon informing Rowan's construction manager, who notified Woolslayer of the missing parts, Crown Derrick eventually left the site on August 28, 1998, with the gates still uninstalled. Before leaving, they placed a double rope barricade around the unprotected opening.

Crown Derrick returned to the site on September 22, 1998, to complete work but found the crane needed for the installation inoperative and reported that they were still missing parts for the safety gates. The next day, without any further work on the site and no inspection of the double-rope barricade, Paul Dew fell to his death through the opening.

The double-rope barricade wasn't maintained after Crown Derrick initially left the site. Subsequently, an electrical junction box may have covered the opening, which was later replaced by a single-rope barricade. There were no witnesses to the accident, and it remained disputed whether even the single-rope barricade was in place when Dew fell.

Paul Dew’s wife and parents sued Rowan, Woolslayer, and Crown Derrick for wrongful death and survival, with the trial jury finding all three defendants negligent and apportioning fault among them. Crown Derrick appealed, asserting the trial court erred by not submitting a jury instruction on new and independent cause. The appellate court agreed, prompting the case's presentation for review.","The court will reverse the appellate court's judgment and remand it for the appellate court to consider other issues raised in the appeal. The argument made by the erector (Crown Derrick) will not hold because the assumption that its double rope barricade constituted an adequate safeguard will be rejected since the jury verdict indicated that it wasn't. Crown Derrick breached its duty of ordinary care by leaving the platform opening without adequate safeguards. Therefore, any subsequent alterations to this inadequate safeguard, like removing or altering the ropes, would not qualify as a new and independent cause—since they did not fundamentally change the foreseeable consequences of Crown Derrick's original negligence.

The court will assert that Crown Derrick isn't entitled to a new and independent cause instruction based on several aspects. First, the risk of danger was obvious once they left an open hole without proper permanent protective measures. Second, any acts which altered the barricade didn't bring a fundamentally different kind of danger but merely exploited the original risky condition left by Crown Derrick. Third, the foreseeability of others disrupting the ineffective barriers is consistent with the original risk Crown Derrick was responsible for. Fourth, it was foreseeable that Crown Derrick’s original negligence, leaving a hole unprotected adequately, could lead to the very injury that occurred, reflecting that this was within the initial scope of risk. Finally, the role of the double-rope barricade can be deemed insufficient due to its easy removability, directly linked to the causal chain leading to Dew's death. The court will likely stress that the principles of new and independent cause dictate that an unforeseen, independent intervening act must not be an expected consequence of the original negligent act for it to supersede the initial act, which is not the case here."
"This case involves a personal injury lawsuit filed by Kelly Shane Hearne against his employer, Charles Duncan McMillan d/b/a Anthony Sign Company (McMillan), on November 2, 2016. McMillan is a nonsubscriber to the worker's compensation system. The incident in question occurred on September 14, 2015, when Hearne, who had been employed by McMillan for approximately twenty-five years, attempted to restore the marquee sign of the Grand Theatre in Paris, Texas. Hearne initially failed to reach the sign using the bucket of a company bucket truck and then decided to access the roof from the interior of the theatre. He asked McMillan to bring a thirty-foot-long extension ladder from his truck to aid in this attempt.

Upon McMillan's arrival, he and Hearne positioned the ladder to access the attic of the theatre, with McMillan holding the ladder from the bottom as Hearne ascended. When Hearne reached the attic and discovered that his flashlight was not working, he communicated his need to descend for a functioning flashlight or batteries. However, while descending, Hearne saw McMillan walking away, which he believed led to the ladder slipping and his consequent fall to the concrete floor, resulting in severe injuries requiring multiple surgeries.

McMillan contested these events, claiming that when he left to get the flashlight, Hearne and the ladder were stationary on the floor, and he never supported the ladder nor witnessed the fall.

The Occupational Injury Benefit Plan established by McMillan covered $65,271.88 of medical costs and past wages, along with a $250 deductible personally paid by McMillan. Hearne sued McMillan for negligence, and after a trial, the jury ruled in Hearne's favor, awarding him $162,818.38 in past damages and $265,000.00 in future damages. McMillan appealed, seeking an offset for the amounts paid to Hearne by the Occupational Injury Benefit Plan and contesting the jury's findings. The trial court found McMillan was entitled to a $91,911.02 offset and entered a judgment for the amounts awarded by the jury, less this offset. Hearne cross-appealed, asserting errors including the trial court's handling of past damages and the offset applied. The appeals court took up the matter to decide these issues.","The appeal will result in the affirmation of the trial court's judgment as modified. Regarding McMillan's liability for Hearne's injuries, the court will find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish negligence on McMillan's part. Hearne's testimony that McMillan ceased supporting the ladder served as some evidence of negligence since McMillan owed and breached a duty to provide a safe working environment, including adequate assistance for safe work performance.

In relation to proximate cause, Hearne's fall and subsequent injuries will be considered foreseeable consequences of McMillan's negligent action. The foreseeability will rely on McMillan's own admission that he would never leave someone alone on the ladder due to the potential dangers. Given that and Hearne's recount of events, the jury had enough information to determine that McMillan's negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries.

Addressing the handling of damages, the appeals court will find that the trial court was within its discretion in determining an offset of the past damages post-verdict since there was no factual dispute over the amounts paid by the Plan, rendering the collateral source rule inapplicable. The substantial and primary purpose of the plan was for the employer's protection, rather than a fringe benefit for the employee. Hence, the trial court's award of the offset was not in error.

However, the appeals court will hold that McMillan is entitled to an offset of $65,521.88 rather than the $91,911.02 applied by the trial court. The greater amount improperly included payments made to third-party negotiators, which were not direct benefits described by the Plan as eligible for offsets against any judgment. Consequently, the judgment will be modified to reflect the correct offset amount, resulting in an award of $97,296.50 for Hearne's past damages. As modified, the trial court's decision will be affirmed."
"The appellants, a nightclub (Hellenic Investments, Inc.) and its owner (Konstantinos Venetoulias), are appealing a judgment from the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. The appellee, Tressie O'Brien, a nightclub patron, sued under the Texas Dram Shop Act, claiming she was injured in a car accident after becoming intoxicated at the appellants' nightclub. On October 27, 1990, O'Brien went to celebrate a birthday and consumed approximately half a beer before arriving at the Hullabaloo nightclub. There, after declining initial drink offers from Venetoulias due to concerns about driving home alone, she accepted upon Venetoulias’ assurance that she would be driven home by someone else. Over the course of the night, she was served about fifteen drinks, amounting to six to eight times her usual consumption, and became highly intoxicated. An off-duty police officer she encountered noted it was obvious she had been drinking and was probably legally intoxicated.

Despite the apparent intoxication, nightclub bartenders continued to serve her drinks until closing time. Upon leaving, Venetoulias had to support O'Brien to walk due to her intoxication. He then took her to her car, placed her inside, started the car for her, provided her money and license, and left her there. Subsequently, O'Brien had a one-car accident resulting in injuries. The trial court found that the nightclub and its owner were one-third negligent, awarding O'Brien actual and punitive damages totaling approximately $57,500. The appellants challenged the sufficiency of evidence to support the findings of negligence under the Dram Shop Act and proximate cause of the injuries. It was also argued that O'Brien's own actions contributed over fifty percent to her injuries and that she could have made safer choices such as waiting in the car or calling a cab from an adjacent grocery store.","The court will affirm the decision made by the trial court, holding the appellants one-third negligent. The verdict will support that it was foreseeable to Venetoulias that O’Brien could be injured after he left her intoxicated in her car with the keys in the ignition. By serving her excessive amounts of alcohol and facilitating her access to her vehicle while visibly intoxicated, the nightclub and its owner will be found to have violated their duty under the Texas Dram Shop Act.

The decision will emphasize that the nightclub provided alcohol to O'Brien when she was obviously intoxicated, presenting a clear danger to herself and others, and this served as a proximate cause of her damages. The appellants' argument that O'Brien's decision to attempt to drive was an unforeseeable, intervening cause will not be persuasive. Her attempt to drive in an intoxicated state, having been facilitated by the appellants’ actions, was a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of the nightclub and its owner, not an intervening cause that absolves the appellants of responsibility. Additionally, the court will state that the trial court's determination of responsibility is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence given to them.

Moreover, the court will find that Venetoulias had indeed undertaken a duty to ensure O'Brien was transported home safely and failed to fulfill this duty, leading to her injury. The appellants' remaining points of error regarding the duty owed by Venetoulias and the cause of O'Brien's injuries will be overruled. They are deemed either inadequately argued or unsupported by the evidence reviewed. Thus, the trial court's judgment will stand, holding that both Venetoulias and the nightclub were correctly held liable for the actual and punitive damages awarded to O'Brien."
"In 2000, Eloisa Casas was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A year later, medical professionals believed the cancer was in remission. However, on July 10, 2001, she was admitted to Rio Grande Regional Hospital with abdominal pains, fever, and a mildly elevated white-blood-cell count, suggesting a potential infection. Dr. Carlos Garcia-Cantu, her surgeon and primary physician, consulted with infectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Jelinek. Dr. Jelinek prescribed Maxipime and Flagyl on July 11 to prevent certain intra-abdominal infections.

Casas underwent major abdominal surgery on July 13, revealing metastatic cancer perforating her colon, allowing material to leak into her abdominal cavity and causing an intra-abdominal abscess. Dr. Garcia-Cantu drained the abscess, repaired the colon, and inserted a drain to prevent further issues. The antibiotics were continued post-surgery, and a culture revealed an E. coli infection effectively treated by Maxipime. The hospital staff, however, failed to renew the prescriptions after five more days, causing a four-and-a-half-day lapse in medication between July 18 and 23. During this period, Casas did not receive Maxipime or Flagyl but was prescribed Diflucan for Candida (a fungus) and Vancomycin for coagulase-negative staph infections, neither of which Maxipime nor Flagyl would have treated.

Casas developed an abscess in her wound on July 23, which was drained by reopening the wound. The next day, the wound emitted a foul smell. Upon learning of the prescription lapse, Dr. Jelinek immediately prescribed different antibiotics, Levaquin and Vancomycin. After a CAT scan showed no abscess, the drain was removed on July 25. Casas was discharged on August 23, readmitted in early September, and died two months later.

Several family members filed a lawsuit against the Hospital, Dr. Garcia-Cantu, and Dr. Jelinek in May 2003, claiming their negligence caused Casas to suffer extreme pain and mental anguish beyond what would have occurred with proper care. An expert report was submitted, and Dr. Jelinek later filed a motion for sanctions and dismissal because the expert report did not sufficiently establish causation between the negligence and the injury. The trial court denied the motion. Before trial, the family nonsuited Dr. Jelinek and Dr. Garcia-Cantu.

At trial, the jury found the defendants' negligence caused Casas's injury, assigning the majority of fault to the Hospital and a smaller percentage to each doctor. $250,000 in damages were awarded for Casas's pain and mental anguish. The Hospital and Dr. Jelinek appealed the decision, with the latter contesting the denial of his motion for sanctions and dismissal. The court of appeals affirmed all issues.","The court of appeals' judgment was reversed, and a new judgment was rendered that the family take nothing due to insufficient evidence connecting the Hospital's negligence to Casas's additional pain. Despite admitting the antibiotics should have been continuous, the absence of evidence suggesting an infection treatable by the omitted antibiotics negated the claim since Casas experienced other infections during that time which accounted for her symptoms.

As for Dr. Jelinek's petition, the court agreed that the trial court should have granted his motion for sanctions and dismissal because the expert report failed to establish causation adequately. The expert report concluded, without explanation, that Dr. Jelinek's breach of the standard of care resulted in increased pain and a prolonged hospital stay for Casas. As the plaintiff bears the burden of proving negligence caused the injury, the report did not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the claims had merit.

The expert's testimony did not explain why an undetected, anaerobic infection was more probable than the other known infections and dying tissue, leaving the jury to speculate. Expert testimony must explain the basis of its conclusions and link them to the facts. Without a more definitive explanation drawing a connection between the negligence and the injury, this expert testimony was not found legally sufficient.

Consequently, the case was remanded to the trial court for an award of attorney's fees and costs against the Casas family and their counsel. The supreme court granted Dr. Jelinek's request for review, wherein the testimony of family members and the absent expert testimony linking the prescription lapse to additional pain and suffering were found insufficient for establishing causation. The jury verdict was thus based on legally insufficient evidence, reversing the previous decision and rendering a judgment for Dr. Jelinek to take nothing."
"The plaintiff, referred to as the traveler, sued the defendant, a railroad company, for personal injuries sustained while trying to rescue a pedestrian, Mrs. Parker, from being struck by the company's train. Mrs. Parker was walking on the company's platform towards the boarding area on a rainy day. A pool of water and company trucks obstructed the path, leading Mrs. Parker to walk close to the train tracks where a portion of the train extended over the platform. As the traveler attempted to pull Mrs. Parker out of the way, she was struck by the train, which then knocked her into the traveler. The traveler was injured after being hit by Mrs. Parker or by the train and propelled against the trucks and platform.

The traveler's allegations included that the railroad company negligently constructed and maintained the platform, leaving inadequate space for passengers to pass due to the position of the trucks and the presence of the pool of water, which resulted in the area being dangerously close to the moving train. Additionally, it was alleged the company's employees failed to take action or warn of the danger despite having the means to do so.

The defendant railroad company, while admitting the presence of the pool and trucks on the platform, contended this was not the proximate cause of the injuries. The defense argued Mrs. Parker's sudden movement towards the train was the proximate cause, and that the accident was too unforeseeable for the company to be held liable. During the trial, the focus was on whether the company was negligent in maintaining the platform conditions and if that negligence contributed to the traveler’s injuries. Contributory negligence by Mrs. Parker or the traveler was not claimed as a defense.

The lower court found in favor of the traveler, and the company's motion for a new trial was overruled, leading to an appeal by the defendant.","The reviewing court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The key reasoning will focus on the jury's role in determining the negligence of the company and whether said negligence was a proximate cause of the traveler's injuries. The possible contributory negligence by Mrs. Parker would not defeat the traveler's recovery as her actions and the company's alleged negligence would be considered concurrent causes of the accident.

The court will likely elaborate that the duty of the railroad company in providing a safe environment extends not only to passengers on the train but also on its premises, such as the platform. It will be emphasized that had the company been negligent, as alleged, it would be responsible for the foreseeable consequences. Even if Mrs. Parker acted negligently, contributing to her own peril, this does not shield the company from liability for its role in the sequence of events that led to the traveler’s injuries.

In summary, the court will predict that the railroad company had a responsibility to maintain a safe platform, foresee potential hazards to passengers based on the conditions present, and take necessary precautions. The failure to do so, as determined by the jury, constituted a proximate cause of the traveler’s injuries, independently of Mrs. Parker's actions, and thus the original verdict in favor of the traveler will be upheld."
"The appellant, Joe Butler, was an employee working on the appellee's (Gulf Pipe Line Company) oil pipeline in Tyler County, Texas. Butler sustained injuries while repairing a pipeline when a pool of oil he was standing in ignited. He posited two theories for the cause of the fire. First, he contended that the ignition was due to lightning conducted into the ground near the pipeline by a ground wire from the employer's telephone line. He argued that the employer was negligent in placing the telephone line and ground wire in close proximity to the pipeline. Second, he alternatively alleged that the fire was started by his foreman, Hardy Jenkins, who lit a cigarette, threw the match, and thus ignited the pool of oil—constituting negligence for which the employer should be held liable. 

The trial court sustained a general demurrer to Butler's amended petition which argued that the employer had been negligent in four ways: (1) by placing wires or lightning arresters close to the pipe line, (2) through the foreman's act of throwing a lighted match, (3) by failing to warn Butler of working dangers while lightning was flashing, and (4) by employing a foreman who would strike a match near a pool of oil. The trial court dismissed the action when Butler declined to further amend his suit, prompting this appeal.","The court affirmed the lower court's decision by holding the following: Regarding the placement of lightning arresters, the employer could not have reasonably foreseen injury due to lightning in a similar manner to the plaintiff's injuries, thus they did not meet the standard for proximate cause. Concerning the foreman lighting a cigarette, the act, even if negligent and the proximate cause of Butler's injuries, was not done in furtherance of the employer’s business but for the foreman's personal pleasure. Therefore, the employer would not be liable as the act took place outside the scope of the foreman’s employment. 

As Butler did not present the argument of the employer's failure to warn of the dangers of working during lightning, this point was not addressed in detail. However, it was noted that an employer is not duty-bound to warn about unforeseeable dangers. 

Regarding the employment of the foreman who would strike a match next to a pool of oil, the court determined that the petition did not allege habitual negligence or negligence known to the employer. Since the employer is only expected to exercise ordinary care in selecting employees, a single act of negligence by an employee (the foreman) does not prove employer negligence in hiring. 

Finally, if the oil ignited as a natural consequence of a law of nature (lightning seeking a path of least resistance), the plaintiff would have had as much knowledge of this danger as the employer, which would not constitute negligence on the employer's part. Hence, the general demurrer was properly sustained as the plaintiff's petition failed to establish that the employer's actions were the proximate cause of his injuries. The court's judgment was therefore affirmed."
"Maria Urena and her minor children, S. U. and L. U., resided at the Front Royale Apartments complex in Houston. Urena's sister, Araceli Grimaldo, lived in the same complex, and another sister, Olga Grimaldo, lived across the street at the English Oaks Apartment complex. On November 6, 1999, while Urena was at work, L. U. was left with Araceli and decided to retrieve some toys from his own apartment. During this, L. U. was lured into an apartment by a tenant, Miguel Angel Zuniga, who promised a dollar bill and then sexually assaulted L. U. The aunts discovered the assault, confronted Zuniga who fled before the police arrived, and he has never been found. Zuniga had prior traffic offense convictions but none for violent or sexual crimes.

Appellant Maria S. Urena filed an action against the apartment complex and individuals, for premises liability, among other claims, following her son's sexual assault. The trial court granted summary judgment against the mother, asserting no foreseeability of the crime and no proximate cause for the injury. In response, Urena argued that sufficient evidence of simple negligence and premises liability existed to show the injuries were caused by the defendants' breach of duty.

Over the previous three years before the assault, eight crimes were reported at or near the apartments, including a string of violent crimes such as attempted sexual assault, robberies, and murders. Evidence indicated that some crimes were well known to residents, which could suggest that the risk of such crimes should have been apparent to the apartment complex's management.","The court's decision will likely focus on whether the earlier violent crimes at the apartment complex established a foreseeable risk of harm to tenants from third-party criminal acts, thus necessitating a duty of care from the apartment complex to protect its residents. Based on the Timberwalk analysis, which guides the assessment of whether a premises owner has a duty to protect against foreseeable crimes, the court will investigate several factors: the proximity, recency, frequency, similarity, and publicity of previous criminal activity.

Given the significant number of violent crimes reported at the Front Royale Apartments within three years before the assault on L. U., a court would predict that these prior incidents may establish a pattern of criminal activity that should have been reasonably anticipated by the defendants. The crimes are sufficiently similar, as they are all violent personal crimes, making further violent criminal acts foreseeable.

The verdict will likely conclude that because the risk of similar violent crimes was foreseeable, the defendants (appellees) may have owed a legal duty to protect the residents, including L. U., from criminal acts, and a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding that duty. Hence, the court will find that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment and will reverse the trial court's judgment, remanding the case for further proceedings, except for the dismissed causes of action which were not challenged on appeal (breach of contract, implied warranty of habitability, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act). The court will probably support the need for a full trial to address the issues of foreseeability and the defendants' potential duty of care more thoroughly."
"The Cernys moved into a home in Karnes County, Texas, in 2002 and leased their mineral rights to Marathon's predecessor in 2010, which led to oil and gas operations and the creation of the Brysch-Adams Unit near their property. The Cernys did not have any physical infrastructure placed on their property by Marathon, but received consistent royalty payments from the operations. In 2013, the Cernys filed suit against Marathon Oil Corporation and Marathon Oil EF, LLC (collectively ""Marathon""), as well as Plains Exploration & Production Company (Plains), citing harm from toxic emissions, exacerbated health problems, new health problems, and property damage due to oilfield operations surrounding their home.

The Cernys claimed that Marathon and Plains' negligence and production activities resulted in various issues, including offensive odors, constant traffic, dust, and noise, changing their quiet, rural lifestyle. The Cernys specifically filed for private nuisance, negligence, gross negligence, and negligence per se, seeking compensation for medical expenses, loss of earning capacity, physical and mental pain and suffering, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of use of their property, remediation damages, loss of market value of their property, and punitive damages.

In response, Marathon and Plains filed motions for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, focusing on lack of evidence of causation. The trial court granted defendants' motions to strike the majority of the Cernys' evidence as inadmissible. This left only the affidavit of the Cernys' minor son and two experts' affidavits (without their full reports). Consequently, the trial court granted summary judgment motions filed by Marathon and Plains. The Cernys appealed the decision, emphasizing that not all their claims required expert testimony under Havner and that lay affidavits and non-medical expert testimony were sufficient to establish causation.","The trial court judgment will be affirmed, upholding the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Marathon and Plains. The case is characterized as a toxic tort claim, thus the Cernys were required to present expert testimony to prove causation under Havner standards, which apply to their claims despite their attempts to disclaim reliance on expert testimony by framing their damages as those for ""comfort rather than disease”. Since the Cernys’ claims arise out of exposure to toxic emissions and nuisances claimed to be caused by nearby oil and gas operations, it is outside laypersons' general knowledge and demands expert evidence on causation.

The Cernys will have failed to present more than a scintilla of probative expert evidence regarding each of Havner’s causation prongs: they did not exclude alternative causes for their alleged injuries to a reasonable certainty; no expert evidence differentiates between pre-existing conditions and claimed new health problems; and there is a lack of evidence that specifically links Marathon and Plains to the prohibited emissions on the Cernys’ property. Additionally, testimony from the Cernys and lay witnesses will not constitute more than a scintilla of evidence causally linking Marathon and Plains to dust, noise, traffic, and foul odors experienced by the Cernys. Conclusory and speculative lay opinions will not meet the burden of proof for causation in nuisance claims, especially when there is no evidence identifying Marathon or Plains as the proximate cause of these conditions and not evidence excluding the participation of other nearby oil and gas operators.

On these grounds, the trial court will not be found to have erred in granting a no-evidence summary judgment for all of the Cernys' claims, including private nuisance and negligence, and the judgment will be sustained."
"The case revolves around a fatal collision that occurred in October 2000 at the intersection of State Highway 21 and Farm-to-Market Road 95 (FM95) in Nacogdoches County, Texas. Driver Earl Haley, with passengers Heather Anderson and Casey Pate, either stopped or slowed to a crawl at a stop sign before slowly entering the highway, where their vehicle was struck by a tractor-trailer truck traveling just above the speed limit. The evidence suggested that the sight line from the stop sign to Highway 21 was obstructed by trees and underbrush that had grown up in the state highway right-of-way, severely limiting the view of oncoming traffic until the vehicle was entering or very close to the intersection.

The survivors of the deceased sued the Texas Department of Transportation (the Department) under a premises defect theory. They claimed that the Department did not maintain clear sight lines at the intersection by trimming the vegetation as necessary, which therefore created a safety hazard. The jury found the Department sixty percent responsible for the incident and deceased driver Haley forty percent responsible. The Department argued on appeal that its sovereign immunity was not waived by the Texas Tort Claims Act because keeping sight lines clear was supposedly a discretionary duty. They also challenged the jury's findings relating to the Department's negligence—particularly on the grounds of unreasonable risk of harm, failure to warn, and proximate cause—and questioned the admission of subsequent remedial measures as evidence.","The judgment will be affirmed based on the following reasoning:

(A) Sovereign Immunity Does Not Bar Recovery
The appellate court will disagree with the Department's claim of sovereign immunity because the Texas Tort Claims Act grants a limited waiver of immunity in the case of premises defects, which is what is alleged in the lawsuit. The lawsuit will be interpreted as centered on the Department's duty to maintain the right-of-way and not as a complaint about the discretion of the Department's design decisions. The Act's waiver of immunity for nondiscretionary functions such as maintenance will be taken to apply in this case.

(B) The Evidence Is Sufficient To Support the Jury's Findings
1. Unreasonable Risk of Harm—The jury's finding will be supported by evidence demonstrating that the sight line was compromised to less than one-third the recommended visibility, establishing a condition posing an unreasonable risk of harm.
2. Failure to Warn—The Department's argument that the presence of a stop sign and blinking light constituted adequate warning will not suffice because they do not warn drivers of the specific condition of limited visibility. Moreover, Haley seemingly complied with the stop instructions, and the lack of further warning will be seen as a failure on the Department's part.
3. Proximate Cause—Evidence will suggest that Haley's inability to see oncoming traffic and the subsequent lack of response time were substantial factors in causing the accident, thus establishing the Department's negligence as a proximate cause of the injuries.

(C) Admitting Evidence of Subsequent Remedial Measures Was Harmless Error
The Department's claim that admission of evidence regarding subsequent remedial measures, such as the post-accident cutting of trees, was improper will be held as not meriting a reversal. It will be argued that the Department's lack of objection at trial to certain exhibits showing the sight lines before and after the trees were cut, effectively waives any error. Moreover, the other admitted evidence would have allowed the jury to logically deduce the same conclusions, and thus any error in admission would be considered harmless.

In summary, the appellate court will affirm the judgment against the Department due to a finding that sovereign immunity does not protect it in this situation, that the evidence supports the jury's findings of negligence on the part of the Department, and that any error in admitting evidence of subsequent maintenance was ultimately harmless."
"The plaintiff, Monte Puryear, filed a malpractice suit against Dr. G. G. Porter, Dr. J. A. Finer, and anesthetist T. W. Baker, claiming that the improper administration of a spinal anesthetic resulted in his paralysis below the level of the sixth dorsal vertebra. The plaintiff asserted that the anesthetic needle was inserted between the first lumbar and sixth dorsal vertebra, causing a rupture and contusion of the spinal cord and resulting in total paralysis of his lower extremities. The jury found that Baker injected the spinal needle into Puryear's spinal cord above the level of the first lumbar vertebra, which they deemed to be negligence and the proximate cause of his injury. They awarded Puryear $134,860 in damages.

The physicians' defense focused on multiple points of error. They contested the location of the needle puncture, whether it was correctly found above the first lumbar vertebra, and whether the injection into the spinal cord was established as the negligence that proximately caused the paralysis. While there was testimony on the unusual nature of spinal needle injection above the first lumbar vertebra as a medical proposition, osteopathic physicians did not testify establishing proximate cause. Medical testimony suggested that paralysis like Puryear's could not be caused by an injection at or below the cauda equina (lower back), but there was no consensus from either osteopaths or medical doctors directly linking the needle injection to the paralysis.

Subsequently, the case raised questions about the roles and relationships between the defendants. Dr. Porter argued that Baker was acting under his payment and directives, rendering him a joint venturer and the anesthetist's acts as his duty. Dr. Finer, involved in the administration of the spinal anesthetic, was also implicated as engaged in a joint venture with Dr. Porter. The appeal challenged evidentiary support for negligence, proximate cause, the scope of employment of Baker, and the relationship between the doctors.

As part of the arguments, the plaintiff's attorney made inflammatory statements regarding an unrelated malpractice case concerning one of the defendants, prompting the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the advocate's comments.}

{","The appellate court will analyze each point of error meticulously. Concerning the location of the needle puncture and the evidence supporting the jury's negligence finding, the court will likely overrule the appellants' arguments, indicating that the evidence is indeed sufficient to support the jury's determination that the spinal puncture occurred above the first lumbar vertebra and that such a procedure was considered negligent according to medical experts from multiple schools of practice.

However, the court will concur with the appellants on the point concerning proximate cause. Due to the lack of osteopathic physician testimony directly linking the needle injection to Puryear's paralysis and the testimony from expert witnesses of both medical schools that a spinal needle injection into the spinal cord would not directly cause paralysis, the appellate court will find that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's finding on proximate cause. Consequently, this point will be sustained since negligence and proximate cause must be testified to by an expert from the same school of practice as the defendant in malpractice cases, and the plaintiff failed to provide such testimony from osteopathic physicians.

Regarding the joint venture and employment scope points, the court will find substantial undisputed evidence that both Dr. Porter and Dr. Finer were engaged in a joint venture and that Baker was acting within the scope of employment under Dr. Porter when administering the anesthesia, thus rendering Factors Four A, Four B, and Five moot in light of the sustained error on proximate cause.

The court will also address the irreparable prejudice caused by the plaintiff's attorney's inflammatory comments about an unrelated malpractice suit against a defense witness, noting that such statements could have warranted a reversal alone had they been preserved as a point of error on appeal. In the absence of that point, they will be dismissed with guidance for the next trial to limit evidence of witness interest to relevant, non-inflammatory information.

Ultimately, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed on the basis of the error in establishing proximate cause, and no testimony from any osteopathic physician substantiating this link, in conjunction with the court's findings on the other points of error. The case will be remanded for a new trial, where the plaintiff will have to provide sufficient evidence from an osteopathic physician to prove both negligence and proximate cause, and avoid prejudicial statements.}"
"An electric company (appellant) sought to appeal a trial court decision favoring a widow (appellee) in her suit to recover damages for the wrongful death of her husband. The husband died while attempting to cut a telephone wire that was heavily charged with electricity due to contact with an electric wire from the appellant company. The telephone wire was sparking at the time, and the husband had received a mild shock when he tried to use the phone earlier. Before attempting to cut the wire, the husband reassured his wife that there was no danger, not knowing that the electric wire had made contact with the telephone wire. The family's home had no electric service, and the husband had no experience with electricity. He was a barber by profession.

The widow's claim against the electric company cited negligence in the maintenance of dangerous, insufficiently insulated wires, which sagged and fell across the telephone company's wires, charging them with a high-voltage current. The electric company defended itself with a general denial and alleged contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The electric company also attempted to bring the telephone company into the lawsuit, claiming that it was their negligence that primarily caused the accident.

During the trial, the electric company requested a continuance to make the telephone company a defendant, which was denied as it would cause undue delay. A motion to direct a verdict was also denied because evidence suggested potential negligence in how the electric company installed and maintained its wires. Matters of contributory negligence and assumed risk argued by the electric company were also viewed as issues of fact for the jury to decide.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, implying that while the electric company argued that a directed verdict should have been given due to lack of evidence showing negligence or because of the deceased's contributory negligence, the evidence did show potential negligence in the proximity of the electric and telephone wires and how securely they were fastened.

As for contributory negligence, the court would likely conclude that this was not a matter of law for the court to decide because it was unclear whether the husband knew of the danger he was in when attempting to cut the wire. Given the perception of a fire hazard and his attempt to protect his property, as well as his lack of expertise in electricity, a jury should determine if his actions constituted contributory negligence.

The court would probably find no cause to admit the telephone company into the suit, as the electric company did not demonstrate diligence in doing so before the trial, and inclusion at that point would have delayed proceedings unfairly to the plaintiff.

The request for special charges by the electric company, such as on assumed risk or contributory negligence, would likely be deemed unnecessary or incorrect given the overall evidence and the established legal principles being correctly applied by the trial court.

Given the circumstances—especially the utility company's failure to act on the danger presented by their wires and the jury's role in determining contributory negligence—the appellate court would predictably affirm the lower court's decision to award damages to the widow for her husband's death."
"Mid-Cities Surgi-Center hired a scrub technician, David Wayne Thomas, who stole fentanyl—an anesthetic—contaminated it with Hepatitis C, and resealed the ampules to conceal his theft. After Thomas’s actions were discovered, he was convicted and imprisoned. Subsequently, patients who received fentanyl injections prior to the discovery of Thomas's crime filed a lawsuit against Mid-Cities Anesthesiology, P.A., which consisted of a professional association of ten doctors who practiced anesthesia at the surgical center, collectively referred to as the doctors' association. The patients alleged negligence in various forms, including failing to properly secure anesthesia narcotics and exposing them to contaminated medication. 

The doctors' association's professional liability insurer initially defended the suit but became insolvent. The Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (TPCIGA) then assumed its obligations. TPCIGA tendered the suit for defense and coverage to American Indemnity Co., the general liability insurer at the time of the litigation. American Indemnity initially denied coverage based on effective dates but later agreed to assist TPCIGA in settling the claims for approximately one million dollars, without involvement from Utica National Insurance Company, who was the general insurer at the time of the infection. 

American Indemnity filed a suit seeking reimbursement from Utica for settlement costs, arguing that Utica breached its obligation to defend due to a policy excluding coverage for any ""bodily injury... due to rendering or failure to render any professional service."" Utica contended that the policy precluded coverage any time medical treatment was a but-for cause of injury, even if services were rendered with due care. However, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, determining the exclusion applied only when there was a breach of standard of care in rendering professional services. The plaintiffs' pleadings suggested possible negligence in the drug's administration and in its storage—issues involving both professional, covered by professional liability, and non-professional negligence. The latter, potentially covered by general liability insurance, activated the duty to defend under the eight-corners doctrine.","The court is expected to affirm the duty to defend as mandated by the eight-corners doctrine, which dictates that an insurer must defend a lawsuit if the facts alleged in the pleadings could potentially fall within the policy's coverage. It is foreseeable that since the plaintiffs' pleadings allege negligence in both administration and storage of the drug—actions that could involve non-professional standards of care—the general liability insurance from Utica should have been enacted to defend the doctors' association. The crux of the duty to defend is based on the possibilities raised within the pleadings themselves, not the ultimate liability or manner in which professional services were rendered.

Moreover, the court will likely clarify that the duty to indemnify is distinct from the duty to defend and is resolved separately. While Utica was held responsible for defense costs, the company's obligation to indemnify for the settlement will not be established as a matter of law, as the record on appeal won't definitively determine whether the patients' injuries resulted from a violation of professional standards of care—a breach that would trigger the professional service exclusion in Utica's policy. 

Given that the indemnity obligation centers on factual determinations rather than legal interpretations, the court will probably reverse the court of appeals' judgment on the indemnity issue. It is expected that the case will be remanded to the trial court for a factual resolution on whether the breach of professional standards of care by the doctors' association contributed to the injuries to the patients, thereby enabling the application of the professional services exclusion and negating Utica's duty to indemnify. If, on remand, it is found that the injuries were co-caused by factors both covered and excluded under the policy, the general liability insurer would not be required to indemnify for those injuries. In essence, the verdict will underscore the insurers' respective responsibilities and the need for further examination of causation to satisfactorily resolve the indemnity aspect of the dispute."
"Bryan Posey was arrested for assaulting his mother. During the intake process at the jail, Posey denied having attempted suicide in the past or currently having suicidal thoughts or tendencies. The intake officer failed to complete a part of the Mental Disability/Suicide Screening Form, specifically the section evaluating whether Posey was a risk for medical issues, mental health concerns, or suicide. Despite this omission, Posey was seen by a nurse for an injury on his hand, who then referred him to a psychiatrist for an anger management evaluation. Initially, Posey was placed in a holding cell with a cordless telephone, from which he made several harassing calls to his mother. His mother requested that the calls stop, resulting in Posey being transferred to another cell that contained an inoperative corded telephone. Tragically, Posey used the cord from this inoperable telephone to hang himself and commit suicide.

Following his death, Posey's parents filed a negligence lawsuit against the county, alleging that the county was negligent in assessing Posey's risk of suicide and in placing him within a cell that had a corded telephone. It came to light that the county had previously ordered the replacement of corded phones with cordless models, which suggested awareness of the potential suicide risk associated with telephone cords. The county responded by filing a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that it was immune from lawsuit under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2). Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals denied the county's plea, prompting the county to appeal to the supreme court.","The supreme court will decide whether governmental immunity is waived in the case where a prisoner used a telephone cord to commit suicide, as per Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.021(2). The court will determine that the county's immunity is not waived, citing that the county merely allowed Posey to use its property (the telephone cord) without causing the incident themselves. The court will distinguish between mere provision of property and actual causation by government use, paralleling Posey's case with Cowan, where the government also did not misuse tangible property, but rather the patient misused it.

The court will observe that the failure of the county to replace the corded telephone with a cordless one constitutes a non-use or misuse of property, which does not waive immunity under the aforementioned statute. Moreover, the court will conclude that the condition of the telephone (exposed wires) having a defective nature, was not proximately causing Posey's death as it would need to pose a hazard in its intended and ordinary use. Since the exposed wires did not actively cause the injury, this precludes establishing the necessary causal nexus between the condition of the property and the injury.

Lastly, the quality of Posey's suicide risk assessment would be deemed irrelevant to the county's immunity status, even if Posey had been identified as a suicide risk. This is because the assessment did not have a direct bearing on the county's placement of Posey in the cell with the corded phone which he used in his suicide. The court will affirm that governmental immunity remains intact under the narrow conditions that waive immunity, which the court finds absent in this situation.

Therefore, with these reasons, the court will grant the county's petition for review, vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, and dismiss the case."
"The City of Keller, a rapidly growing suburb of Fort Worth, Texas, approved plans for two new subdivisions, Estates of Oak Run and Rancho Serena, which included revised plans for stormwater drainage that affected the Wilsons' property but did not conform to the City's Master Drainage Plan. The Master Drainage Plan, adopted by the City in 1991, dictated that drainage easements be provided across the properties of both Z.T. Sebastian (adjacent to the Wilsons) and the Wilsons themselves, leading into the Little Bear Creek Watershed. The developers' plans included the construction of a long drainage ditch on the Sebastian property with detention basins on the subdivision properties, but they did not include any drainage easement across the Wilson property.

The City approved the plans submitted by the developers, which according to the Wilsons, led to increased flooding on their property, ruining eight acres of their farmland. The City's Director of Public Works approved the developers' plans, and the City accepted the completed works. It was uncontested that three sets of engineers certified that the revised plans conformed to the City's codes and regulations, which should have prevented an increase in downstream flooding. The Wilsons argued that the City knew the approved revised plans were substantially certain to cause flooding on their property.

For the Wilsons to recover damages for inverse condemnation, they had to prove intentional taking or damage to their property for public use by the City, or that the City was substantially certain this outcome would result. The City contended there was no evidence supporting the jury's finding of intentional taking, claiming it wholly relied on engineers' assurances that complied with the City's regulatory requirements.

The divided Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's decision in favor of the Wilsons, applying the ""exclusive"" standard of legal sufficiency review, which considered only evidence that tended to support the finding and disregarded all evidence to the contrary, including the engineers' certifications. The City contested this, arguing that the Court of Appeals had used the wrong scope of review. The case cites a long history of variations between the ""inclusive"" standard, considering all evidence in a light favorable to the verdict, and the ""exclusive"" standard. There is an in-depth exploration of the circumstances in which contrary evidence should either be considered or disregarded in evaluating legal sufficiency.","The Supreme Court of Texas reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remands the case due to the failure of properly applying the correct scope of legal-sufficiency review in connection with the intent requirement for an intentional taking under the Texas Constitution. The Supreme Court clarifies that a reviewing court must consider all evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could do so, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. The Court finds that the evidence presented by the Wilsons did not meet the required standard to demonstrate that the City intentionally took or was substantially certain to damage their property, particularly given that the City had been advised by multiple sets of engineers that the plan would not result in increased downstream flooding.

The evidence the Wilsons brought forward did not demonstrate the City knew more than what these engineering reports conveyed. Even though the City's actions might raise concerns, in the absence of proof that the City knew the advice it received was wrong, there is no evidence that the City's approval of the revised drainage plan was an intentional taking. The Court acknowledges the alternate verdict claim under the Texas Water Code but leaves it to the Court of Appeals to resolve as it was not previously addressed.

The jury finding against the City is set aside, with the rationale being that the engineers' certifications and other official assurances provided a basis upon which the City could rely, nullifying the claim of intentional or substantially certain knowledge of damage to the Wilsons' property. The Court thus remands the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration of the claim under the Texas Water Code."
"The appellant, a telephone company, appealed against a judgment made by the District Court of Llano County (Texas), which was in favor of the appellee, a husband whose wife was struck by lightning and sustained serious injuries while inside their home. The lightning was alleged to have been conducted into the house through the company's wires. The home that the husband and wife moved into previously had telephones from both the appellant company and another business, and when the telephones were removed, the company's wires were left in place. It was presented in evidence that the company did not employ a lightning arrester, a common device used to prevent such accidents, and there was conflict over whether the wires were properly grounded and disconnected from the main line. Testimony indicated that a lightning arrester was more effective than grounding the wires, and the most secure way to prevent lightning danger was to completely remove the wires, which was not done by the appellant company. The trial court ruled in favor of the husband, awarding damages for personal injuries to his wife and the diminished capacity of the wife to perform household duties and earn money.

The appellant company contended that the court's charge to the jury was erroneous and misleading, suggesting that it would be negligent for leaving wires in a residence after removal of the telephone instrument if those wires could conduct lightning. The appellant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's award for the diminished capacity of the wife to discharge her duties and earn money.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court based on the evidence that shows the injury to the appellee's wife was caused by the negligent failure of the appellant company to remove its wires from the house or to safeguard the wires with approved appliances to prevent injury from lightning. The court will hold that the telephone company owed a duty not just to use precautions known to it or its agents, but to exercise reasonable care in selecting and using the best methods known to science to protect from such injuries, considering it operated a dangerous agency.

The court will find that the failure to give a requested special charge about the grounding of the wires as protection was not error. It will reason that elementary care required is higher than just using methods known to the company; it involves taking all reasonable precautions known to prevent lightning damage.

The court will further determine that the main charge, when read with other parts of the charge and an additional special charge given at the appellant's request, was not significantly erroneous or prejudicial to the appellant company.

Regarding the jury’s award for the wife's diminished capacity, the court will conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the award. It will refer to the principle that the value of a wife's services can be inferred from the nature of her injuries and can be assessed by the jury without direct testimony regarding their monetary value. The jury's common knowledge and the circumstances in which the husband and wife lived are deemed sufficient for them to ascertain a reasonable value for such loss of services.

Taking all the evidence into consideration, the court will find that there is no reversible error in the trial court’s judgment or the jury's verdict, and will thereupon affirm the judgment against the telephone company. Writ of error will be refused, upholding the ruling in favor of the appellee husband."
"Robert Jerry Davis experienced an ""impingement"" in his left shoulder following a work-related incident, which was initially treated with physical therapy and ultimately with arthroscopic surgery performed by Dr. James Harris. Post-surgery, physical therapy was recommended for rehabilitation. Mr. Davis preferred undergoing therapy at Baylor Medical Center in Gilmer, Texas, where it was overseen by Johnny Lee-On, a licensed physical therapist, Penney Downey, a college student intern training to be a physical therapist assistant, and a third person functioning similarly to a secretary.

While engaged in therapy using a machine called the ""Total Gym,"" Mr. Davis noticed that it was malfunctioning and informed Ms. Downey, who attempted to make adjustments. On a subsequent set of exercises, with Mr. Lee-On not present and Ms. Downey temporarily out of the room, the machine again malfunctioned, causing Mr. Davis's left arm to be pulled over his head, resulting in excruciating pain.

Dr. Harris examined Mr. Davis after the incident, noting worsened condition and difficulty in motion. A subsequent MRI revealed a torn rotator cuff, which required a second surgery. Dr. Harris's testimony indicated that the worsened condition and injury were consistent with the exercise machine incident described by Mr. Davis.

Mr. Davis's life was adversely affected following the incident, as he was in constant pain, unable to do ordinary activities, and lost his previously held job that paid $2,500 per month. His wife also felt the impact, as it affected their relationship and she lost her job due to the time needed to care for him, though she obtained employment later.

The Davises alleged that Rehabilitative Care Systems of America (RCSA) was negligent for not properly supervising Mr. Davis during the use of the Total Gym. Expert witnesses for both sides testified about the expected standard of care and procedures in such therapy settings.","The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The argument that expert testimony was necessary to establish the standard of care was rejected because the negligence claimed did not involve sophisticated medical treatment decisions, but rather the supervision of a patient handling potentially dangerous equipment, which falls within the understanding of average jurors. The Davises adequately showed through both lay testimony and expert opinions that a physical therapist should be in the vicinity of the patient to respond to any issue during such therapy sessions, and this did not require medical expertise to understand.

In terms of causation, expert medical testimony indicated that there was a reasonable medical probability of a causal connection between the injuries suffered by Mr. Davis and the lack of proper oversight during his exercise on the Total Gym. Dr. Harris testified that although he could not factually confirm the incident, the worsened condition and subsequent findings were consistent with the type of accident described by Mr. Davis.

For RCSA's contention about the factual insufficiency of evidence, the court deemed the jury's verdict as not being against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. It did not find the verdict to be manifestly unjust or indicating any bias. The Davises' account of the incident and the testimony supporting the consequential damages presented a reasonable basis for the jury's decision.

Given the testimony and evidence provided, including the worsening of Mr. Davis's condition after the incident and the standard of care expected in such therapy settings, the verdict leaned toward a decision favoring the Davises. All factors considered, the decision to affirm the trial court's judgment appears well-founded on the principles of negligence, specifically duty, breach, causation, and damages."
"Emmanuel Melissinos, the appellant doctor, was taken to court by Thongkhan Phamanivong, the appellee patient, after a medical treatment performed by Melissinos resulted in injuries to the patient. The case took place in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. Phamanivong argued that Melissinos failed to obtain his informed consent for surgical procedures, specifically a ""Morrison procedure,"" and also committed fraud in the course of failing to obtain that consent.

Phamanivong, a Laotian refugee who did not speak English, suffered a work-related accident on July 21, 1981, which resulted in the severing of his thumb, index finger, and part of his middle finger from his right hand. The initial treatment included cleaning the hand, tissue removal, and storing the severed thumb bone in his groin for potential future use. Although the Morrison procedure, which involves using skin tissue, arteries, and bone from the big toe to reconstruct the thumb, was explained to Phamanivong, he refused consent.

Later, Melissinos and others attempted to obtain Phamanivong's consent again. An interpreter, Sang Seunsom, was involved in a disputed conversation about the consent for the procedure. Phamanivong claimed that Melissinos only described an incision, drainage, and skin graft, saying nothing about the Morrison procedure, avoiding the discussion of risks, and urging immediate decision for the surgery to ensure future employment.

The Morrison procedure was performed on August 10, 1981. When Phamanivong found out part of his toe was used, he was distressed and later considered suicide. The surgery led to an infection and subsequent loss of part of the bone in the reconstructed thumb, necessitating two more skin graft surgeries.

Phamanivong was unable to work for most of six years post-surgery and experienced pain when walking due to missing tissue from his toe. Furthermore, the deformity of his hand and foot resulted in embarrassment, leading him to keep them covered.

Post-verdict, lawyers' attempts to modify or challenge the court's judgment played a significant role. Melissinos contended the trial court erred in submitting jury questions concerning failure to obtain informed consent and allegations of fraud. He challenged the jury's findings, particularly on lost earnings and informed consent.","The appellate court will uphold the trial court's judgements that Melissinos failed to obtain informed consent and committed fraud, but will modify the award to exclude recovery for loss of future earning capacity due to insufficient supporting testimony. The court will determine that Melissinos did not waive his right to challenge the jury's findings by requesting judgment on the verdict post-trial, noting that procedural rules aim to facilitate justice, not to prioritize form over substance.

In addressing Melissinos’ challenges, the court will find that the trial court properly submitted jury questions regarding informed consent and fraud. The court will conclude that the definition of informed consent provided to the jury was satisfactory and that the alleged fraud cause of action was correctly submitted to the jury, given Melissinos' misrepresentations about the thumb and toe appearing normal post-surgery.

The court will also contend that the jury's findings on fraud and the decisional element of informed consent are supported by evidence, notably the interpreter's testimony and Phamanivong's claim that he would not have consented to the Morrison procedure had he been fully informed. The evidence concerning lost earnings will be deemed sufficient as Phamanivong was unable to return to his pre-surgery job, where he earned $4.00 per hour, as a result of the surgery.

However, about the loss of future earning capacity, the appellate court will find no legally sufficient evidence since there was no testimony at trial to establish what Phamanivong's potential earnings might have been if the surgery had not occurred. Consequently, the appeal court will modify the trial court's judgment to exclude the award for loss of future earning capacity, affirming the remainder of the trial court's decisions."
"The appellant beneficiary initiated a lawsuit to recover from an insurance policy after the employee, Eli H. Landman, covered under the company-provided accidental loss benefits policy, died following an automobile accident. The insurance policy was issued by the appellee, Union Mutual Life Insurance Company, to Binswanger Glass Company, and provided accidental loss benefits to eligible employees, including Landman, who died after an accident on December 1, 1969. The insurance policy defined ""injury"" as bodily harm caused by an accident that results directly and independently of other causes. The policy excluded coverage for any loss caused by or resulting from disease. The appellee insurance company presented an affirmative defense in the suit, contending that Landman's death was not solely from accidental injuries sustained in the accident but was also proximately caused or contributed to by his pre-existing heart and lung diseases. The case focused on conflicting evidence about Landman's cause of death. The autopsy report listed the cause of death due to hepatic lacerations and external trauma but also noted significant conditions such as pulmonary emphysema and cardiac hypertrophy.

During the trial, the jury was presented with several material issues, specifically around the cause of death—whether it was a result directly and independently from the automobile accident (to which the jury responded 'Yes') and whether Landman's pre-existing lung and heart diseases were proximate causes of his death (to which the jury also responded affirmatively, indicating these diseases were proximate causes). Based on these seemingly contradictory answers, the trial court entered a take-nothing judgment in favor of the appellee, against which the appellant is now appealing. 

The appellant contends that the answers to the jury's special issues are so irreconcilably conflicting that the judgment based on them should be reversed for a new trial. The appellant refers to rules indicating that conflicting findings on material facts create a fatal conflict, which means the verdict cannot stand. It is emphasized that in insurance cases where accidental injury is at play, it is the plaintiff's burden to show the injury was independently of all other causes. Similarly, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that any alleged disease was not a proximate cause when the insurer has presented such a condition as an affirmative defense. The Supreme Court has previously indicated that ""independently of all other causes"" means ""solely,"" ""only,"" or ""standing alone."".","Based on the detailed background, the judgment is predicted to be reversed and remanded due to the irreconcilable answers provided by the jury. The jury found that the death resulted both independently from the accident and was also caused by pre-existing diseases. This presents a conflict since the insurance policy requires the cause of death to be solely due to an accident. The juridical principle that conflicting findings cannot legally support a judgment will likely lead to the original judgment being set aside. The appellate court will probably not accept forced or strained constructions of the jury's findings to reconcile the contradiction. As a result, the judgment in favor of the appellee will be overturned and the case sent back for a new trial because the appellant was entitled to a verdict in her favor based on the answer to Special Issue No. 1 alone, while conversely, the appellee was entitled to a verdict based on the answers to Special Issues No. 3 and No. 4 alone. Therefore, the appellate court will conclude that the answers are in fatal conflict, necessitating a reversal and remand for a new trial where these issues can be resolved without contradiction. }"
"Plaintiff David Ianni, a police officer, filed a lawsuit against Loram Maintenance of Way, Inc. (Loram), after being shot by Roger Arnold Tingle, an off-duty employee of Loram. Ianni claimed that Loram was negligent, alleging the following:

- Loram was aware or should have been aware that Tingle was under the influence of mind-altering drugs and posed a danger.
- Loram failed to control Tingle or seek help for him despite knowing he was under the influence of drugs.
- Loram allowed Tingle to leave its workplace while under the influence of drugs.
- Loram continued to work Tingle when it should have known he was a danger to himself and others.
- Loram introduced a crew ""hooked on drugs"" into El Paso as a result of the demanding work environment and failed to manage the situation safely.
- Loram released Tingle into the public knowing he was under the influence of drugs.

Loram sought summary judgment, claiming that it owed no duty to Ianni, arguing that its conduct was not the proximate cause of Ianni's injuries, and that there was neither negligence nor gross negligence.

Tingle and his crew used methamphetamine to stay awake for their demanding job of operating rail grinding machines for long hours, including travel time to and from their accommodation. Tingle's supervisors were aware of his drug use and his out-of-control behavior, which included a violent incident involving another crew member's wife. Tingle later shot Ianni when Ianni came to the aid of Tingle's wife during a domestic dispute.

Loram's drug policy mandated drug testing for safety reasons, but Soger, one of the supervisors, admitted that he wouldn’t act on reports of drug use without firsthand knowledge, apparently to avoid machine downtime.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Loram.","Considering the detailed background, it can be predicted that the appellate court will find that Loram's actions did present a genuine issue of material fact concerning negligence and gross negligence, reversing the trial court's summary judgment and remanding it for trial. The evidence suggested that Loram created a dangerous situation by imposing rigorous work conditions and was aware of the widespread drug use among the crew, which was detrimental to their safety and the safety of others. 

Loram’s supervisory personnel, who were in a position to prevent harm, were also using drugs. They were made aware of Tingle’s drug use on several occasions and of the associated risks, but failed to take appropriate action such as drug testing or removing Tingle from the workplace. Their inaction was rooted in a policy of keeping the rail grinding machine operational, indicating a conscious indifference to the safety and welfare of others, including potential bystanders like Ianni.

Furthermore, Loram's supervisors knew that Tingle was incapacitated and yet allowed him to leave the workplace in such a state, did not help Patrice Tingle when she wanted to leave due to fear of her husband, and took no action after a violent incident involving another non-employee. Their conduct suggests that they had actual, subjective awareness of the risk yet proceeded with conscious indifference.

In conclusion, the appellate court is likely to find that Ianni presented sufficient evidence raising genuine issues of material fact regarding Loram's negligence and gross negligence. The conduct of Loram's supervisory personnel falls within the scope of a managerial capacity, involving an extreme degree of risk and showing actual awareness of the danger while being indifferent. This satisfies the Moriel test and thereby opens up the possibility for Ianni not only to pursue compensatory damages but also exemplary damages due to gross negligence. The case will be remanded for a full trial to examine these issues in detail."
"The wrongful death lawsuit under review involves the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (the Department), which is the appellant challenging the partial denial of its plea to the jurisdiction by the 342nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas). The appellees are family members, including the mother (Bonnie Ledbetter) and other relatives of John Ledbetter, an inmate who died while in the custody of the Department. The Department’s employees are alleged to have misused a transport van, handcuffs, and other restraints, contributing to John's death. 

On June 27, 2008, John Ledbetter was found non-coherent and vomiting in his cell. Instead of calling an ambulance, correctional officers transported him to another prison facility for evaluation. John was placed in handcuffs and additional restraints and laid on his side in the backseat of the transport van because he was unable to protect himself from vomiting. The appellees claim that due to the restraints' misuse, John asphyxiated on his vomit, leading to his death. 

The Department contends that it is entitled to sovereign immunity, as governed by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2), and that John Ledbetter's death was not proximately caused by the use of tangible personal property, i.e., the restraints, arguing that the cause of death was congestive heart failure as determined by an autopsy. 

The evidence examined by the trial court includes witness statements from officers, nurses, and an inmate, as well as an autopsy report. Statements describe that John had vomited, was confused, shaking, and eventually became unresponsive. He was placed in a lying-down position in the van, and upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, he wasn’t breathing and had a very faint pulse. Testimonies noted John's purple skin color upon arrival at Robertson Unit, which is consistent with asphyxiation. The autopsy report, however, indicated no foreign objects or materials in the airway, listing congestive heart failure as the cause of death.","The Department's plea to the jurisdiction will be affirmed based on the evidence presented. The trial court's decision is mainly hinged on whether the Department's evidence conclusively disproves causation related to the misused restraints. Although the autopsy report lists congestive heart failure as the cause of death, it does not completely negate the possibility of asphyxiation, particularly since the timing of when John's airway was cleared is crucial to the findings. The evidence from witnesses suggests that he may have asphyxiated as a result of being restrained while actively vomiting, which could have prevented him from clearing his airway.

Since the Department has not provided definitive proof that John's symptoms upon arrival at the Robertson Unit were inconsistent with asphyxiation, the autopsy report’s finding that the airway contained no foreign objects does not conclusively disprove the appellees' claim that the restraints were a contributing factor to John's asphyxiation. Consequently, in light of the plaintiff's allegations and the evidence favoring the nonmovant, it is not demonstrated beyond doubt that the use of restraints was not a proximate cause of John Ledbetter’s death. Thus, the trial court did not err in its partial denial of the plea to the jurisdiction, and the plea's denial will be upheld, allowing the case to proceed under the Texas Tort Claims Act based on the alleged misuse of restraints."
"Betty Battle was an elderly woman living in southwest Houston with adult sons and nearby daughters who visited her frequently. A smoker of approximately one to one-and-a-half packs of cigarettes a day, Betty Battle suffered from various pre-existing conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, kidney problems, dehydration, malnutrition, and possible dementia. After suffering a fall and undergoing hip replacement surgery in March 2004, she was transferred to Mariner Health Care of Nashville, Inc. for rehabilitation, where she did not have any pressure ulcers upon admission according to her primary physician, Dr. Khoa Nguyen. However, during her stay, Battle developed stage-3 and stage-4 pressure ulcers, was transferred to different hospitals for blood transfusions and ulcer care, and returned to Mariner still suffering from the ulcers.

Battle died on August 18, 2008, with cardiopulmonary arrest listed as the cause of death, though an autopsy was not performed to ascertain this definitively. Gladys Robins, Battle's daughter, filed suit against Mariner for medical malpractice under both the Texas Wrongful Death Act and Survival Statute, alleging that Battle’s injuries and death resulted from negligent care provided by the nursing home. A jury found in favor of Robins solely on the survival action, awarding her $750,000 in damages, which the trial court later reduced to $250,000 under the statutory cap on damages.

Mariner appealed, raising four issues: whether Robins had the standing or capacity to pursue claims on behalf of Battle's estate; whether the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining two challenges to peremptory strikes; whether the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's findings on negligence, proximate cause, and damages; and whether the trial court improperly submitted broad form questions pertaining to damages to the jury.

Robins argued that she had standing to sue as an heir to the estate and that Mariner had waived any complaint about her capacity to sue by not filing a verified plea contesting her capacity. Mariner’s challenges also touched upon various aspects of the nursing home care, including specificity in identifying negligent employees, the qualification of Robins's expert witness, and the relationship between the alleged deficiencies in care and Battle’s injuries. The trial court's action regarding peremptory strikes was also a point of contention. Robins further witnessed that her mother experienced pain, while medical experts offered testimony about the standards of care for elderly patients and pressure ulcers.

}

{","The appeals court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, supporting the damages awarded to Robins. In addressing Mariner's first issue, the appeals court will determine that since Robins initiated a lawsuit within two years of Battle's death and because Mariner didn’t challenge her capacity with a verified plea during litigation, any claims regarding Robins's standing or capacity are deemed waived. The Battle's estate had a justiciable interest in the controversy sufficient to confer standing on Robins to bring the survival action.

Regarding Mariner’s second issue, the appeals court will find that Mariner has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion when it sustained Robins's challenge to the peremptory strike of an African-American veniremember, given that the stricken juror ultimately did not support the verdict against Mariner. This issue will be considered harmless as it had no bearing on the final outcome of the case.

For the third issue, the court will conclude that the expert testimony, specifically from Dr. Lipson, was legally and factually sufficient to support the findings of negligence, breach of care, and the proximate cause of Battle's injuries. Dr. Lipson’s qualifications, expertise, and testimony provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the neglectful care provided by Mariner and its direct impact on Battle’s condition. The evidence presented at trial will demonstrate that Mariner failed to meet the standard of care in hydration, nutrition, pain management, and prevention of pressure ulcers, which contributed to Battle's pain and suffering.

As for Mariner's fourth issue, the court will determine that Mariner failed to preserve its objection to question 7 of the jury charge because it did not specifically object to that question during the charge conference and instead directed its objections to other parts of the charge. Consequently, any claim of error in the submission of damages in broad form will not be considered. The discretion lies with the jury to decide on the amount awarded for subjective and unliquidated issues such as pain and suffering, which will be deemed supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the appeals court will uphold the trial court’s decision, deeming that Gladys Robins, as representative of Battle’s estate, had standing to sue, that Mariner's arguments are without merit, and that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict and the adjusted award of $250,000 to Robins on the survival action.}"
"Jennifer R. Autrey slipped and fell in a Walmart store in Palestine, Texas, resulting in a premises liability claim against Walmart due to alleged negligence which she claimed caused her fall and subsequent injuries. On September 3, 2016, a cashier at Walmart named Breanna Love was notified by a customer of an existing spill near the front doors and vision center. Love, trained to handle spills, attempted to address the situation by assessing and attempting to clean the spill, which stretched from the customer service area to the front doors. The spill was deemed too large for Love to manage alone, so she contacted maintenance and guarded the nearest part of the spill, warning customers. However, no warning signs were placed, as retrieving them would require Love to leave the spill unattended.

Autrey and her husband entered the store at that time, and despite Love's efforts, Autrey slipped and fell. There is disputed testimony regarding whether Love warned Autrey about the spill. Autrey immediately felt pain from the fall, and after the incident, her neck pain worsened, which led her to seek medical attention. The spill was confirmed to be unwarned and not cleaned prior to Autrey's fall. Autrey was diagnosed with aggravated pre-existing asymptomatic disc disease and required surgery, a spinal fusion, and a discectomy, followed by the implantation of a spinal cord stimulator.

Medical professionals that treated Autrey testified that the fall at Walmart exacerbated her preexisting condition, causing significant pain necessitating surgery. Walmart, however, appealed, arguing that the spill was an open and obvious condition, that the store took reasonable steps to address the spill, and that Autrey's injuries could be attributed to her pre-existing condition. Moreover, Walmart claimed a trial court error for refusing to give a jury instruction on sole proximate cause related to a man spilling a drink which could account for the spill leading to Autrey’s fall.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In doing so, the appellate court found that there was legally and factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings. The court established that the spill was not open and obvious, and that Walmart had failed in both adequately warning Autrey and making the condition safe. Despite Walmart's arguments, the jury was entitled to determine that the spill posed an unreasonable risk of harm, and they were entitled to weigh conflicting evidence regarding if adequate warnings were given. 

The evidence showed that Walmart had actual knowledge of the spill and had failed to take ordinary care to make the premises safe since the spill wasn't cleaned up, nor proper warning given prior to Autrey's fall. As for the medical expenses, expert testimony indicated that Autrey's fall at Walmart did aggravate her pre-existing condition, justifying the medical treatments and associated costs. Thus, the judgment awarded her damages for past and future pain, mental anguish, and medical expenses. Regarding the rejected sole proximate cause instruction, the appellate court found that the actions of the man with the drink (possible alternative cause of the spill) did not negate Walmart’s failure to make the condition safe or provide adequate warning, hence affirming the lack of such an instruction in the jury charge. The court's reasoning emphasized that a defendant could be found negligent even when a third party may also share in causation, provided the defendant's own lack of reasonable care contributed substantially to the harm.

"Bock (appellee insureds) engaged in processing and cold storage of meats at their building in Galveston, dependent on electricity for refrigeration. On September 11, 1961, Hurricane Carla damaged electrical transmission lines five miles from Bock’s building, leading to a power outage that continued until September 14, 1961. This caused the temperature in Bock's cold storage vaults to rise and resulted in the loss of 10 to 15 percent of their meat, a financial loss of $2,418.36. Importantly, the hurricane did not directly damage Bock's building or refrigeration equipment. The insurers (appellant insurers) issued policies to Bock insuring against ""direct loss resulting from windstorm, hurricane."" They disputed the claim, arguing that Bock's meat spoilage did not constitute a ""direct loss"" under the policy.

At trial, the court found for Bock, deciding that the meat spoilage constituted a ""direct loss"" as stipulated in the insurance policy. The insurers appealed, contending the loss was not directly caused by the hurricane but was, instead, consequential.

Regarding Texas precedent, there were no cases precisely addressing ""direct loss"" under circumstances where the insured peril acted at a distance and upon uninsured property, yet ultimately led to loss at the insured's location. The court considered the terms of insurance contracts and the principle of proximate cause. The case referenced several previous Texas decisions, definitions, and the concept of foreseeability in establishing proximate cause in insurance contexts. Notably, other cases and jurisdictions were considered but found to be factually distinguishable or not controlling.","The court will affirm the trial court's ruling that Bock’s spoilage of meat was a direct loss caused by the hurricane. Given the chain of events, where a hurricane damaged the transmission lines leading to a power outage and subsequent spoilage of meat, this sequence is seen as unbroken by any new or intervening cause and, thus, the hurricane is considered the proximate cause of the loss. Since Bock did not contribute to the damage and the spoilage was a direct result of the loss of power caused by the hurricane, the loss fits within the policy's definition of ""direct loss.""

The term ""direct loss"" will be interpreted broadly, in line with Texas's precedent of favoring a broad and common parlance understanding of policy terms, and construing ambiguities against the insurer. The proximate cause is defined as a cause which, in a natural and continuous sequence, leading to the loss, without which the loss would not have happened. The court will determine that foreseeability of the damage due to a power outage from the hurricane would reasonably be within the contemplation of the parties at the time of insuring the contents, especially perishable goods requiring refrigeration.

Therefore, the appellate court's position will likely reiterate that the chain of events starting with the hurricane and leading to the spoilage of meat constituted a ""direct loss"" as covered by the insurance policy, obligating the insurer to cover the resulting damages to Bock."
"The case stems from a dispute over a subcontract bid for electrical work to be completed as part of a larger wastewater treatment plant improvement project in Bowie County, Texas, by TexAmericas Center. Heritage Constructors, Inc. (Heritage), was vying to become the general contractor for the project, which was anticipated to span nineteen months. Electric’s last-minute bid, which did not mention Heritage, was lower than other bids Heritage had received. After Heritage used Electric’s bid to become the prime contractor, Electric withdrew their bid, leading Heritage to accept the next lowest bid at a higher price.

During the bid collection process, Carl Smith, Heritage's vice president, received a bid from Electrique Corporation for $886,400.00 and later a lower bid from Chrietzberg Electric, Inc. (Electric) for $704,857.00 excluding concrete work. Carl confirmed this bid over the phone and upon Heritage being awarded the contract for the project, engaged with Electric for value engineering and additional quotes for concrete work. Electric, however, deemed that the duct bank concrete work's price by Heritage was excessive and opted to perform it themselves. Heritage then informed Electric of the project award, and Electric responded positively. When the contract was formally sent to Electric, there were discrepancies regarding the exclusion of the duct bank concrete work. Subsequently, Electric withdrew its bid, and Heritage was forced to contract with Electrique Corporation at the higher price.

Heritage sued Electric on claims of breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation, along with suing Chrietzberg, individually, for the same minus breach of contract. The jury found in favor of Heritage against Electric on the breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation claims, and awarded damages of $50,000.00 for breach/promissory estoppel but none for negligent misrepresentation. The jury found no liability for Chrietzberg individually. Heritage filed motions to disregard the jury's answers due to the assertion of exact financial loss, but the trial court denied these motions and entered a judgment favoring Chrietzberg individually and favoring Heritage against Electric with damages and attorney fees awarded. Electric filed for judgment non obstante veredicto, contesting any existence of contract and citing the statute of frauds, a lack of evidence supporting damages for breach of contract, or promissory estoppel, and challenged the award of attorney fees.","The appellate court will affirm the take-nothing judgment favoring Chrietzberg and the denial of Heritage's claims for negligent misrepresentation. They will reverse the judgment favoring Heritage and issue a take-nothing judgment, as Heritage's claim for breach of contract is barred by the statute of frauds; there is no evidence of damages recoverable based on promissory estoppel; the denial of Heritage's claims for negligent misrepresentation is correct; and Heritage's recovery of attorney fees also fails.

Reasoning for these conclusions will focus on several legal points. First, the statute of frauds bars the breach of contract claim, as the alleged contract could not be completed within one year from making the agreement; it required a written agreement to be enforceable, which was lacking in this case. Given the agreement's terms and the nature of the required acts, Heritage failed to establish that the agreement was outside the scope of the statute of frauds. 

Second, on promissory estoppel, Heritage was unable to provide evidence of damages other than those unobtainable under the unenforceable contract, meaning they could not support their claim for additional, distinct damages based on promissory estoppel.

Third, related to claims of negligent misrepresentation against Electric, Heritage failed to offer evidence of any economic injuries independent of its alleged contractual damages, rendering the claim invalid. Similarly, regarding Chrietzberg's individual liability, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that any misrepresentation was on behalf of Electric, not Chrietzberg as an individual, given how Electric's estimate was formulated and the evidence concerning who was involved in creating and submitting the bid.

Lastly, Heritage is not entitled to attorney fees as they did not prevail on a valid contract claim and are not authorized by statute or by the parties' agreement to collect such fees in this context.

Therefore, Heritage would have none of its claims upheld, and the court would render a take-nothing judgment on the breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims against Electric and would also not award any attorney fees to Heritage."
"La Neta Bobinger underwent a total arthroplasty of her left hip on May 11, 2015, at Tomball Regional Medical Center (Hospital). Her surgeon, Dr. Michael Blackwell, and radiologist, Dr. Voon Ping Liaw, reviewed her post-operative x-rays and concluded that the hip showed ""satisfactory alignment without fracture or loosening."" During her recovery in the hospital, Bobinger exhibited an unsteady gait, could tolerate little weight bearing, had a lot of swelling in the left hip and thigh area, and experienced pain levels that were out of proportion despite pain medication. The physical therapist noted her inability to meet a short-term goal of climbing stairs and documented Bobinger's significant pain and swelling. Upon discharge, despite these issues, she was readmitted on May 19 with a fracture of the proximal femur. Following a second surgery, she was readmitted again on June 9 with a prosthetic-joint-and-hardware infection and transferred to St. Joseph Medical Center, where she was diagnosed with a failed arthroplasty and a greater trochanteric femoral fracture. A surgeon at St. Joseph performed a revision surgery on her hip, reduced both fractures, and drained and debrided her hip wound.

Bobinger brought negligence claims against the Hospital, Dr. Blackwell, Dr. Liaw, and Houston Northwest Radiology Association, focusing on her vicarious liability claim against the Hospital based on alleged omissions by its physical therapists and nurses. She alleged that the Hospital failed to properly administer drugs, evaluate her before discharge, diagnose and monitor infection and misalignment, improperly discharged her, and discharged her while she had a misaligned fractured hip and infection. As a result, she claims to have suffered physical pain, mental anguish, impairment, disfigurement, incurred medical expenses, and loss of earnings.

Bobinger filed and served an initial medical expert report by Dr. Cecil Rene Arredondo, which the Hospital objected to for various grounds, including failure to adequately differentiate between physicians, nursing, and therapy care. The trial court sustained the objections and granted an extension for an amended report. Dr. Arredondo's supplemental report stated standards of care for physical therapists and orthopedic floor nurses and declared they breached the standards by not informing Dr. Blackwell of Bobinger's persistent pain and inability to progress in physical therapy before discharge, which contributed to her injuries.

The Hospital filed a motion to dismiss for failing to adequately address the standards of care, breach, and causation, which the trial court denied. The case hinged on whether expert reports made an objective good faith effort to comply with the statutory definition of an expert report and demonstrated that Bobinger's claims had merit.","The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hospital's motion to dismiss. The expert reports from Dr. Arredondo represent an objective good faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 74.351(r)(6) and show that Bobinger's claims against the Hospital's physical therapists and nurses have merit. Specifically, the reports sufficiently identify applicable standards of care relevant to physical therapists and nurses, notably in terms of their responsibilities to report significant post-operative pain, lack of progress in physical therapy, and significant swelling, to the orthopedic surgeon. This reporting is especially critical as orthopedic surgeons rely on such communication from nurses and physical therapists to assess post-operative difficulties and decide on patient discharge.

Furthermore, the reports adequately address the breach aspect by documenting the failure of the Hospital's physical therapists and nursing staff to report the observed issues, differing from the Hospital's assertion that the breach was conclusively shown as absent because the issues were documented in the medical records. Contrary to the Hospital's claim, the documentation alone does not fulfill the communicative duties necessary to ensure proper re-evaluation and patient care decision-making by the surgeon.

In terms of proximate cause, Dr. Arredondo's reports articulate both the foreseeability and cause-in-fact elements. The Hospital's contention that the reports fail to connect the Hospital's conduct to Bobinger's injuries is not persuasive; the reports detail how the Hospital's failure to fully communicate her post-operative condition contributed to an inappropriate discharge and delay in receiving surgical intervention, ultimately leading to significant pain and complicating her recovery. The reports do not expect nurses and physical therapists to diagnose Bobinger's hip fracture, but through observations to identify issues that require urgent re-evaluation by the surgeon before patient discharge, as severe pain itself is a compensable injury when exacerbated by improper healthcare decisions.

As the reports demonstrate a plausible link from the Hospital staff’s actions to Bobinger's subsequent injuries—both due to prolonged pain and delay in identifying the femoral fracture—they satisfy the ""good faith effort"" requirement for establishing causation. Lastly, the reports need not predict or address all possible defenses the Hospital might raise, only establish a reasonable basis showing that the Hospital's acts or omissions proximately caused injury to Bobinger. The trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss will be upheld as Dr. Arredondo's reports provide a sufficient basis to conclude that Bobinger's claims against the Hospital's physical therapists and nurses have merit."
"The plaintiff, a customer of the defendant restaurant, was injured after intervening in an altercation involving a third party, referred to as Yosemite, on the restaurant's premises. Before the plaintiff's arrival, the manager of the restaurant was aware of a previous fight between Yosemite and two other men, but did not call the police. The plaintiff witnessed signs of a previous altercation upon driving into the parking lot but moved his car away to order food. Shortly thereafter, Yosemite was confronted by the same two men demanding repayment of a gambling debt. The plaintiff intervened in an attempt to calm the situation, but was assaulted by one of the men named Ainsworth. The manager was notified of the fight by a waitress and called the police, who arrived shortly after the altercation.

The jury found the manager's failure to call the police before the plaintiff was struck constituted negligence and proximate cause of the injuries. Moreover, they determined the plaintiff acted as a reasonably prudent man in intervening. Despite these findings, the lower court entered judgment for the defendant, prompting the plaintiff to appeal on the basis that his actions were motivated by humanitarian impulses and the jury found he acted prudently. The plaintiff contended that the rescue doctrine should apply, granting an exception to the non-liability rule. It was further stipulated that the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposed himself to danger, but the contention was that this did not preclude his recovery due to his intentions to assist.

Evidence showed the manager was aware of the initial fight prior to the plaintiff's arrival but considered it to have stopped. The manager intended to call the police about an unrelated issue when informed of the altercation near the plaintiff's car. The injured plaintiff arrived on the scene between 10:30 and 10:45 PM, and the assault took place within 15 minutes of arrival, prior to the 11:00 PM call to the police by the manager.

Yosemite was not a customer of the restaurant but was using the parking lot as a meeting point to continue travel with a friend. He occupied the status of a licensee on the premises, to whom the restaurant owed no duty to prevent third-party assaults.","The appellate court will likely affirm the judgment in favor of the defendant restaurant, reasoning that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's injuries resulted from a known and appreciated danger, which he voluntarily and deliberately exposed himself to as a result of an intelligent choice, and lawfully there is no exception that justifies his voluntary exposure, invoking the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria. The plaintiff's humanitarian motivation to assist does not impart responsibility upon the defendant for not preventing the assault.

Additionally, the appellate court will conclude that the plaintiff's intervention was the direct and proximate cause of his injuries rather than the defendant's delay in contacting law enforcement. The plaintiff, by intervening, expressly acknowledged the risk of becoming involved in the conflict and assumed the role of mediator, which was likely to incite the participants to violence against him. The implication is that without the plaintiff's intervention, the injury would not have occurred, as evidenced by other bystanders who did not intervene or suffer harm. The court will uphold that the rescue doctrine is not applicable because the hazardous situation of Yosemite did not arise from a breach of duty the defendant owed to him, given his status as a licensee. The absence of causation between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injuries will be deemed sufficient to bar recovery for the plaintiff. Therefore, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment for the defendant."
"The driver of an automobile, W. C. Coe, was involved in a collision with a train owned by the Texas & New Orleans Railway Company at a public street crossing in Fort Worth, Texas. This accident caused personal injuries to Coe and damage to his automobile. Coe filed a lawsuit against the railway company seeking damages for his injuries and the depreciation in the value of his car. The trial court awarded Coe a total of $2,675—$2,500 for personal injuries and $175 for damages to his car. The railway company challenged the trial court’s judgment on the grounds that the damages awarded were excessive and that the jury was improperly instructed about the measure of damages. Despite the company's argument, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. 

Coe was suffering from various diseases and ailments prior to and at the time of the accident, including syphilis, which the defendant suggested might account for at least the major portion of the injuries for which he sued. Both Dr. W. C. Duringer and Dr. Judge Lyle, who were witnesses for the defendant and plaintiff respectively, testified that plaintiff had been afflicted with serious permanent venereal diseases before the accident. The jury instruction on damages allowed for damages related directly and proximately to the collision, excluding any disabilities or suffering resulting from preexisting conditions not caused by the collision. The jury was instructed to consider the nature of the injuries, their seriousness, permanency, the resulting mental anguish, and physical pain, as well as loss of earning capacity, both past and future, so long as these were the direct and proximate results of the collision. The defendant objected that the jury should have been explicitly instructed they weren't to award damages directly resulting from Coe's preexisting diseases. The railway company proposed a separate issue to distinguish the effects of the accident from preexisting conditions, which the court refused, deeming it evidentiary and not an ultimate fact issue. They also assigned error to the inclusion of mental anguish in assessable damages, which the court overruled based on testimony regarding the severity of Coe's injuries and their likely future impact.","The verdict will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the driver, W. C. Coe, on his negligence claim. The reasoning for the verdict in this case will emphasize that the award of damages was found to be ""not excessive."" The court will determine that the jury instructions on the proper measure of damages were appropriate and sufficiently excluded damages associated with the driver’s preexisting conditions. The jury instruction was thorough in enumerating the types of damages Coe could recover for, and it explicitly limited recovery to those losses directly and proximately caused by the collision. Therefore, the instruction was legally correct, ensuring the jury did not award damages for any impairment resulting from the driver's preexisting diseases.

The decision will likely note that the driver was rightfully entitled to damages for any aggravation of his preexisting conditions from the collision, as recognized in the law. The court will further reason that the defendant railroad company's proposed instruction to separate and distinguish the impacts of the collision from Coe's preexisting conditions was considered insufficient as it was not framing an ultimate issue of fact but rather an evidentiary matter. Additionally, the court will reject the company's argument related to the instruction on mental anguish damages because the evidence presented was sufficient to support claims for physical pain and mental suffering Coe experienced post-collision.

The court will overlook the defendant's objection to the use of ""market value"" in the jury instructions as the meaning of ""cash value"" was apparent, and no evidence suggested a conflicting interpretation. Finally, the court will address the railroad company's assertion that the damages were so excessive as to be influenced by bias or prejudice. There will be no merit found in this argument as the damages awarded fell within a reasonable estimation based on the evidence provided. The ultimate conclusion will be that all assignments of error by the appellant are overruled, thus upholding the judgment of the trial court."
"This case involves an appeal from a Texas trial court's judgment in favor of a plaintiff family who filed a negligence suit after the death of the father and husband, Henry Joe Naylor, Jr., in a traffic collision. The defendants in this case are the truck driver, Mazzucco, and his employer, Galveston-Houston Breweries, Inc. The collision occurred on the night of November 7, 1949, at an intersection between U.S. Highway 59 (eastern bound), U.S. Highway 90-A (western bound), and Highway 6, about a mile west of Sugarland on the Houston-San Antonio highway. Mazzucco was driving the truck on Highway 6 and stopped at the intersection before colliding with Naylor's vehicle, which was traveling on Highway 59 toward Houston.

The truck, being large and heavily loaded, required Mazzucco to exercise significant care while driving. It is undisputed upon appeal that there was sufficient evidence of Mazzucco's negligence, through failure to keep proper lookout, failure to have the truck under proper control, and his decision to drive across Highway 59 when it was unsafe to do so due to Naylor's close approach, all of which the jury found to be proximate causes of the collision.

In their defense, the defendants claimed that Naylor was intoxicated, which they asserted as an affirmative defense of contributory negligence. The trial court considered intoxication to be merely an evidentiary issue rather than an ultimate issue and did not submit it to the jury as such. The trial court, thus, allowed defendants to present evidence related to Naylor's intoxication, including the presence of liquor and coke bottles in Naylor's car, the odor of alcohol, a blood test, and the manner of his driving. However, the court did not grant instructions to the jury on recklessness or the implications of impaired condition on the family's entitlement to damages, despite evidence that could have led to a determination of Naylor's recklessness due to intoxication.

In the original judgment, the deceased's widow was awarded $30,000, and each of his three minor children was awarded $10,000. The cost of funeral expenses was stipulated.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision and remand the case for a new trial on the basis that the jury should have been instructed on reckless driving due to the evidence presented that Naylor could have been driving recklessly as a result of alcohol influence. The appellate court will find that, while the issue of intoxication alone is not an ultimate issue of negligence in a civil case, it is indeed a factor to weigh in considering a charge of contributory negligence. Therefore, defendants are entitled to argue that, if the jury finds that Naylor was driving recklessly as a result of intoxication, this impaired condition could negate the family's entitlement to compensation.

Additionally, the court will hold that the argument made by the plaintiff's counsel in closing, which could imply to the jury the consequences of their decision regarding Naylor's alleged intoxication, constituted prejudicial error since informing the jury of the effect of their answer is not permissible. The appellate court will acknowledge that while evidence of intoxication does not solely establish negligence or proximate cause, it is a significant evidentiary fact to be considered in conjunction with other evidence when determining acts of contributory negligence. Based on this, the court will conclude that the trial court's overruling of the objection to the argument and refusal to instruct the jury not to consider the effects of the intoxicated driving was reversible error, necessitating a new trial."
"Lucille Jones is the surviving widow of Tom P. Jones, deceased, and the plaintiff in this case, acting in her own behalf and as next friend of Tom P. Jones, Jr., the minor son of the deceased. She filed a lawsuit against Traders & General Insurance Company to recover compensation under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act for the death of her husband, Tom P. Jones, Sr., which she claims resulted from injuries sustained during his employment.

Tom P. Jones, Sr., while employed by E. L. Jones (sometimes known as E. L. Jones Construction Company), sustained injuries to his left foot due to stepping on a sharp object in Eagle Mountain Lake. This injury caused a serious and painful infection that spread throughout his body, leading to five surgical operations over several weeks. The pain and suffering from the injury and subsequent infections led to Tom P. Jones, Sr. becoming delirious and mentally deranged. In this state, he drank a poisonous mixture of concentrated lye and cleaning fluid, which caused his death three days later on November 14, 1938.

The claim for compensation was initially presented and rejected by the Industrial Accident Board, prompting Lucille Jones to file the action in district court. The trial court sustained the insurer's general demurrer and dismissed the suit, leading the widow to appeal. The appeal argued that the deceased's act of drinking the poison was not willful and intentional because he was mentally incapable of appreciating the consequences due to his disturbed mind, which resulted from the pain and suffering of his injury. Therefore, the death did not stem from a ""willful intention and attempt to injure himself,"" which would fall under an exception to the Workmen's Compensation Act.

The case cited statute and previous court interpretations, emphasizing that to recover for disability or death under the act, the injury must be a producing cause, even if not the proximate cause in a conventional sense of negligence. The legal framework considers diseases or infections that naturally result from the injury part of the injury itself. Thus, if the injury leads to a mental state where an individual cannot understand or appreciate the consequences of their actions, and suicide occurs as a result of an uncontrollable impulse or frenzy, the dependents are entitled to compensation. Whereas if the suicide occurs as a result of a voluntary and willful choice with knowledge of the act's purpose and effect, it introduces a new and independent agency, breaking the chain of causation, therefore barring recovery.","The court is set to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case, siding with the plaintiff and holding that there is a direct and unbroken causal connection between the physical injury, the ensuing mental derangement, and the death of Tom P. Jones, Sr. The court is projected to find that the injury was a producing cause of the mental state leading to the ingestion of the poison, which was not an act carried out with rational knowledge or intent due to the mental incapacity caused by the injury. Following this reasoning, this act does not constitute an independent intervening agency breaking the chain of causation since it was not a result of a ""voluntary and willful choice"" but rather from the effects of the injury, pain, and suffering.

As such, the legal principle stating that to be compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the death must result from the injury or from disease or infection that naturally results from the injury will likely be applied. The court is predicted to grant the plaintiff's claim for compensation, overturning the decision of the trial court that sustained the general demurrer, and remanding for further proceedings in line with the conclusion that the decedent's act was a result of his incapacitated mental state due to his work-related injury."
"The appellants, Brosius & Le Compte, were partners in a business that involved buying, shipping, and selling mules in Paris, Texas. On January 6, 1906, J.B. Brosius bought 24 mules in Lockwood, Missouri, which were to be shipped back to Paris, Texas, for sale. The mules were loaded into a car provided by the appellant, the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, around two o'clock in the afternoon and were shipped via Monett, Missouri, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, and Hugo, Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. The car with the mules arrived in Monett around 2:15 AM on January 7th and was held there until about 5 PM the same day. Brosius, who accompanied the train containing the mules' car, proceeded to Paris when he was informed the mules would not be unloaded in Monett. 

The mules were eventually unloaded in Monett the morning of January 7th, at around 9:30 AM, supposedly to comply with a federal law requiring stock to be unloaded, watered, fed, and rested, before being loaded back into the car around 5:30 PM. They reached Paris just after midnight on January 9th. Upon unloading, it was discovered that one mule had a large cut on its hip, while another, a large bay mare mule, was sick with pneumonia in its second stage and subsequently died. The case revolved around Brosius & Le Compte suing for damages to both the injured mule and for the value of the mule that died. They alleged the bay mule contracted a cold leading to pneumonia due to negligence on the part of the appellants, including unnecessary and unusual delay in transit and conditions endured whilst held at Monett. They alleged the injured mule was hurt due to negligent handling during loading and unloading in Monett and due to a projecting bolt in the car.

The appellants denied any negligence, claimed the trial court's instructions to the jury about their negligence were erroneous since they were not specific to each incident with each mule, and argued that there was insufficient testimony to support negligence causing the death of the mule from pneumonia.","Given the details of the background, the verdict will likely focus on issues of burden of proof, the differentiation of claims for each mule, and the sufficiency of evidence regarding causality of the alleged negligence. The verdict would likely reverse the trial court's judgment for the merchants and remand the cause for further proceedings, primarily because the trial court issued an undifferentiated jury instruction for negligence across both incidents. This could have confused the jury into attributing the same cause to both the injured and the deceased mule without proper evidence of negligence for each individual case. This generalized approach could lead the appellate court to conclude that, while there may have been sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence in the injury to the mule caused by a projecting bolt in the train car, that same assumption of negligence should not automatically extend to the case of the mule that developed pneumonia.

Furthermore, the appellate court may determine that the court erred in allowing the question of a valuable consideration in the contractual agreement between the merchants and the railway company to go before the jury, which should have presumed a valuable consideration for a written contract. Additionally, the court may find that the evidence was insufficient to support that any act or omission by the appellants led to the death of one of the mules due to pneumonia. The evidence presented to suggest that the mule with pneumonia had contracted the illness due to the exposure in Monett appears circumstantial, and the testimony does not conclusively establish that the appellant's actions were the proximate cause of the illness and death. Given these points, the appellate court will likely find that the merchants did not meet their burden of proving negligence on the part of the railroad company for the death of the mule from pneumonia. Thus, the decision will probably focus on remanding the case for retrial to more accurately assess any act of negligence concerning each animal and evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence surrounding the death of the mule due to pneumonia."
"Elizabeth Martinez sued El Paisano Northwest Highway Inc., operating as Taqueria El Paisano, for personal injuries she alleged were caused by the restaurant's security guard. On August 18, 2017, Martinez and her two adult daughters were at the restaurant when a dispute over a $2.50 charge for tortillas led the on-duty manager to instruct security guard Frankarlos ""Frank"" Tovar to remove Martinez from the premises. This resulted in Tovar forcefully taking Martinez outside, placing her in a chokehold, slamming her onto concrete, and handcuffing her. Martinez was taken to the hospital by ambulance after the incident.

In her suit, Martinez claimed that Tovar was either an employee of El Paisano or a company named 250LB LLC d/b/a Delta Security Solutions (""Delta""), but later dropped claims against Delta. She argued that El Paisano was vicariously liable for the guards’ actions and negligent in multiple ways.

El Paisano contended Tovar was an independent contractor, and argued Delta's negligence was the proximate cause of Martinez’s injuries, moving to designate Delta as a responsible third party. The trial court granted this motion.

During discovery, Martinez experienced difficulties obtaining information about El Paisano's staff and its relationship with Tovar. She filed four motions to compel discovery and/or for sanctions, which revealed conflicting testimony about the manager's identity at the time of the incident and other obfuscations by El Paisano. Discovery sanctions were imposed, striking El Paisano's designation of Delta as a responsible third party and awarding Martinez attorney's fees and expenses for certain depositions.

At trial, Martinez presented evidence of her immediate injuries and follow-up medical treatment, which included a range of physical and psychological symptoms. There was expert and lay testimony about Martinez’s preexisting medical conditions and Tovar and Delta's owner provided testimony about the extent of their relationship.

The trial court found that Tovar and another guard, Anna Obregon, were El Paisano employees and were responsible for Martinez's injuries. The court found El Paisano 50% responsible and Tovar and Martinez 25% each. It rejected claims of gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress but awarded damages for various injuries and losses claimed by Martinez.

El Paisano appealed, challenging evidence sufficiency on causation, various damages, vicarious liability for Tovar’s actions, and arguing the court abused its discretion with discovery sanctions.","Given that some of Martinez’s injuries and their subsequent treatment are not within the common knowledge of laypersons, expert testimony would be necessary to establish the causation between the incident and all of her purported medical problems. While lay testimony could establish a link between the assault and immediate ""basic"" injuries, for more complex conditions like memory loss, loss of senses, and hand jerking (possibly due to a seizure disorder), expert evidence is necessary for establishing causation. Accordingly, a factfinder could not reasonably find a causal connection between all of Martinez's medical issues and the August 2017 incident without expert testimony. Therefore, the evidentiary support for the full amount of past medical expenses awarded by the trial court is lacking.

Despite the sufficiency of evidence for some damages, the appellate court cannot order a new trial on unliquidated damages only where liability was contested. Hence, a full retrial is the proper course since the relationship between the severity of the injuries and the compensable amounts is unclear due to the lack of expert testimony for certain medical conditions and treatments.

On discovery sanctions, El Paisano did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the trial court. The sanctions imposed pretrial were related to El Paisano's conduct during discovery, where it repeatedly resisted discovery and provided misleading information, thereby hindering Martinez's investigation into Tovar's employment status and relationship with the restaurant. The monetary sanctions had a direct correlation to the harm caused by this conduct.

In conclusion, the trial court's judgment regarding discovery sanctions against El Paisano will be affirmed. All other aspects of the judgment, including those on liability and the various elements of damages awarded, will be reversed and remanded for a new trial, as the complexity of the medical conditions and the lack of expert testimony to establish causation for some conditions make a precise determination of damages infeasible."
"Melvin James Farmer, the appellant, initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Fred DeFrancesco, the appellee, after suffering injuries ostensibly due to medical treatment and care provided by Dr. DeFrancesco following an on-the-job accident where a piece of concrete fell on Farmer's left lower leg. The treatment included surgery and post-operative procedures. However, Farmer's wound became infected with various bacteria, leading to multiple hospitalizations, additional surgeries, and ultimately, the amputation of his leg.

Farmer consulted with Dr. DeFrancesco several times between February and July 1985, during which he underwent various treatments and procedures, such as an open reduction and internal fixation of the leg, antibiotic treatments, and skin graft surgery by another surgeon, Dr. Montoya. Despite these procedures and follow-ups, the infections persisted, leading to more drastic measures such as consulting with an infectious disease specialist and transferring Farmer for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which also failed, resulting in the amputation.

Dr. DeFrancesco filed for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. Farmer challenged the summary judgment, asserting that there was insufficient evidence to support it and claiming procedural errors, including the trial court's failure to provide him with an opportunity to depose an expert witness, Dr. William Mogabgab. Farmer also objected to the contents and consideration of affidavits by Dr. DeFrancesco's experts and argued that the trial court erred by requiring him to prove a prima facie case during the summary judgment hearing.

Two key affidavits were central to the trial court’s decision. The affidavit from Dr. Carl Vartian supported Dr. DeFrancesco's case by detailing the care provided, affirming that the standard of care was met, and stating that no act or omission of Dr. DeFrancesco was a cause of the loss of Farmer’s leg. Conversely, Farmer’s expert, Dr. Mogabgab's affidavit, failed to establish the expert's qualifications or articulate a standard of care, a breach of that standard, or a causal connection to Farmer's injuries.

The court’s review adhered to the standards outlined by the Texas Supreme Court for summary judgments. This included taking evidence in favor of the non-movant as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor unless the movant’s evidence is uncontroverted.","The court will affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Dr. DeFrancesco because Farmer, the appellant, did not produce controverting evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on the elements of negligence and proximate cause, which Dr. DeFrancesco's evidence conclusively negated. The court will reason that Dr. Vartian's affidavit effectively negated the elements of breach of standard of care and the causal connection with harm suffered. Since Dr. DeFrancesco met his burden of showing an absence of a material fact issue, the burden shifted to Farmer to present evidence that there was indeed a genuine issue for trial.

Farmer’s reliance on Dr. Mogabgab's affidavit will be determined insufficient because it lacked statements on the relevant standard of care, how Dr. DeFrancesco’s actions may have been below that standard, or how those actions caused Farmer's injury. Because these are necessary components in a medical malpractice claim, and Farmer's evidence failed to address them, the court will find that there is no controverting evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact for trial concerning negligence and proximate cause.

The court will also find no abuse of discretion by the trial court for denying Farmer additional time to depose Dr. Mogabgab, as sufficient time was provided. Furthermore, the court will determine that procedural objections regarding Dr. Vartian's affidavit, such as the attachment of medical records and questioning of his expertise, were not preserved for appeal due to Farmer's failure to challenge these at the trial level.

The court will also overlook Farmer's procedural objections on the grounds that he did not adequately argue or provide authority for his points, effectively waiving these issues.

In summary, the decision to affirm the judgment will be based on procedural groundings and the substantive failure of Farmer’s evidence to raise genuine issues of material fact concerning the allegations of medical malpractice against Dr. DeFrancesco."
"Rita L. Iracheta (""Iracheta"") filed a products liability lawsuit against General Motors Corporation (""GM"") regarding a design defect in the Toronado that she claimed caused the deaths of her two grandsons, Edgar and David, in a post-collision fuel-fed fire. The case was tried in the 49th Judicial District Court, Webb County, Texas. The accident occurred on Highway 83 between Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, when Silvandria Iracheta, the mother of Edgar and David, collided head-on with an eighteen-wheeler, resulting in an instant fatality for Silvandria and a subsequent fire that engulfed the Toronado, where both boys died. 

The central issue at trial was whether the Toronado’s fuel system contained a design defect responsible for a post-collision fuel-fed fire that ultimately caused Edgar's death (David's death was attributed to other causes). The jury concluded that a design defect caused Edgar's death and awarded actual and exemplary damages, which GM appealed. 

Evidence presented at trial supported the jury's finding of a design defect: the Toronado’s fuel system had failed during the crash, and a safer alternative design that would prevent siphoning of fuel was identified and found to be economically and technologically feasible. Witnesses testified that, based on the presence of a secondary fire and other observations, a fuel-fed fire likely resulted from siphoned gasoline following the initial crash.

Expert testimony discussed the siphoning and defects of the fuel system, as well as the conscious pain and suffering that Edgar experienced post-collision (after the 'whoosh'). The jury found in favor of the plaintiff, to which GM filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict/motion to disregard jury answers, which the trial court overruled. GM appealed the decision, raising nineteen issues including the insufficiency of evidence on the design defect, causation, conscious pain and suffering, and malice, as well as challenges related to jury instructions, jury argument, and the applicability of conformity with federal standards to the finding of malice.","The appellate court deliberated on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the trial and determined that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's findings. The court found that the Toronado’s fuel system indeed failed during the crash and that GM had knowledge of the problem with the fuel line. Additionally, the court deemed that low-cost measures like an anti-siphon break hole and a duck bill valve could have been implemented to eliminate the risk of fuel siphoning, which would have been economically viable and technologically feasible.

Considering the testimony regarding Edgar's conscious pain and suffering, the court inferred he was alive and conscious for a brief time post-crash, which substantiated the jury's damages award for conscious pain and suffering. The court further evaluated the evidence of GM's malice and concluded that it was both legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's findings. The appellate court upheld that GM acted with malice knowing the risk posed by the fuel system defect and the viable safety measures that could have been employed to mitigate the risk.

Finally, the appellate court considered all of GM's other arguments and found no reversible error. As such, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, thus sustaining the damages awarded by the jury to Iracheta for the actual and exemplary damages caused by the design defect that led to Edgar's death."
"The case involves a lawsuit filed by E.J. Mitchell and his wife, Estella Mitchell, against the appellant, a streetcar company, alleging negligence. The incident occurred on June 4, 1919, around 11 p.m., when the Mitchells were aboard a streetcar operated by the company. They intended to alight at a usual stop near Collins Garden in San Antonio, but the streetcar did not stop at the designated place. Instead, the car stopped in a location where the tracks were two or three feet above the street grade and there were surrounding weeds, making the area difficult to see at night.

E.J. Mitchell, who had signaled for the stop a block earlier, disembarked with a baby in his arms and, realizing the hazard, warned his wife to be careful. She followed but fell while alighting, injuring herself with one foot out and the other bent under her. They were unaware that the streetcar had overshot their intended stop. Mrs. Mitchell was pregnant at the time, unbeknownst to Mr. Mitchell, and she was considered a healthy individual before the fall.

Following the accident, Mrs. Mitchell's health deteriorated. She gave birth to a child approximately nine months later, but both she and the newborn experienced significant health issues following the delivery. The child passed away a few months after birth. Mrs. Mitchell reportedly started coughing about three weeks post-injury and her condition worsened until her demise on April 11, 1920.

Medical evidence presented at trial indicated that Mrs. Mitchell had been healthy prior to the accident, having recovered from the influenza epidemic in 1918. There was no evidence of tuberculosis at that time, according to Dr. Stout, an expert specialist who had examined her in 1918. However, her health declined rapidly following the accident, leading to tuberculosis which, as argued, was a result of her injuries.

The District Court, after considering the presented medical testimonies, ruled in favor of Mr. Mitchell and his minor child, Edward Leonard Mitchell, awarding them a total of $10,000 in damages, apportioned as $3,000 for E.J. Mitchell and $7,000 for Edward Leonard Mitchell.","Given the precedent established in the Groner Case and other related citations, the court in the present case will affirm the judgment against the streetcar company. The reasoning for this verdict will focus on the fact that the company's negligence did not have to be the immediate cause of death but merely a contributing factor. The injury sustained by Mrs. Mitchell, as found by the jury, was sufficient to significantly weaken her powers of resistance to the onset of tuberculosis, which ultimately hastened her death. Even if Mrs. Mitchell had a predisposition to tuberculosis, the aggravation and acceleration of the disease due to the injury would still render the streetcar company's negligence a proximate cause of her death.

It will be argued that the injury acted as a catalyst for the tuberculosis infection by lowering her bodily defenses, and this weakened state allowed the disease to develop and expedite her demise. The court will highlight that the testimony was consistent, and the jury was within its rights to determine that Mrs. Mitchell's health prior to the fall was robust. They were also entitled to conclude that the accident and the resulting injuries were the primary reasons for the subsequent decline in her health and eventual death. There was no intervening cause shown between the streetcar company's negligence and Mrs. Mitchell's death that could mitigate the company's responsibility.

The streetcar company's appeal, which challenges the sufficiency of evidence and the connection between the injury and tuberculosis, will be found lacking as there was enough conflicting medical testimony to enable the jury to find in favor of the Mitchells. The verdict will not be considered excessive because the amount corresponds with the loss and suffering experienced by the Mitchells, which the jury deemed to be a direct consequence of the negligent act. Additionally, the law does not require that the defendant or its employees should have foreseen the specific result of their actions, only that some injury could naturally result from the negligence. The streetcar company's petition on the grounds of excessive verdict and newly discovered evidence will not be grounds for reversal. Every case holds unique facts that must be considered on their own merits when assessing damages. Therefore, the court's final judgment will lean towards affirming the lower court's decision and upholding the damages awarded."
"The appellant, T. L. Garrett, acting as the next friend of his minor daughter, filed a lawsuit against the appellee, Sinclair Refining Company, seeking damages for negligence. Garrett was an employee of Sinclair Refining at their Fort Worth refinery. He alleged that the employer had constructed a rudimentary water closet (toilet) for its employees that lacked a separate urinal and only had a narrow board to sit on, which became filthy and contaminated with gonorrhea germs. Garrett claimed that in using this toilet he contracted gonorrhea and, being unfamiliar with the symptoms and unaware he had the disease, unintentionally infected his minor daughter through the use of the same toilet seat at home and shared towels.

The jury sided with Garrett, finding that Sinclair Refining had been negligent in providing safe toilet facilities, which was a proximate cause of both Garrett's and his daughter's infections. This negligence was not seen as the sole proximate cause, as Garrett's own actions were also found to be negligent and contributing to the infections but similarly not the sole proximate causes. Despite these findings, the trial court granted Sinclair Refining's motion for judgment on the verdict, denying Garrett's motion, and consequently denying the damages initially awarded by the jury. The trial court's decision was based on the reasoning that the employee's subsequent actions of sharing towels and failing to protect his family were not foreseeable by the employer.","The court will affirm the judgment that denied Garrett recovery of damages for his daughter's infection. The court will consider that, even if Garrett contracted the disease due to the employer's negligence, it was not reasonably foreseeable for Sinclair Refining to predict Garrett would subsequently fail to safeguard his own family against the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the court will support its affirmation on the lack of direct evidence that Garrett contracted gonorrhea from the water closet at Sinclair Refining's facility or that the employer knew about the presence of the infection-causing germs on the toilet seat.

In reaching the verdict, the court will rely on the legal principle of foreseeability in negligence cases, noting that not every act of negligence justifies the imposition of damages if there are unforeseen intervening causes contributing to the outcome. The court will assert that the father's duty to protect his family should not have been overridden by his capacity as an employee, and the basic parental instinct to shield his child from harm should have been anticipated. The court will conclude that the employer's negligence at best created the conditions possible for injury but was not the direct cause of the minor daughter's infection—placing considerable weight on the series of intervening actions by Garrett that were not expected to occur. Additionally, the verdict will be underpinned by the assertion that there is insufficient evidence to establish a reasonable probability that Garrett contracted gonorrhea from the employer's toilet, instead of being based on mere speculation and possibility. The court will reference legal precedents that align with their rationale for foreseeability and the distinction between directly affecting a minor child and a parent's contributory negligence."
"The appellant, a railway company, contested the trial court's decision that awarded damages of $10,000 to the administrator of a deceased railway employee's estate under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.S. §§ 51-59). The railway employee sustained an injury from a workplace collision and later died of pneumonia several weeks afterward. The damages were apportioned among the surviving children of the deceased. On appeal, several procedural and substantive legal issues arose. Firstly, the appellant challenged the timeliness of the filing of the appeal bond and the transcript, both of which were ruled to be non-issues due to the clerk's established approval of the bond and the appellee's waiver of the timely filing of the transcript. Additionally, concerns were raised about the adequacy of the pleadings in describing one of the children as ""afflicted,"" which was deemed insufficient for determining that child's pecuniary loss and dependency on the decedent's support.

The action was brought by the estate's administrator because the Federal Employers' Liability Act required such cases to be filed by a representative of the employee's estate. A jury awarded the sum apportioned as follows: $2,400 to Leonard Arnold, $2,000 to Lennie Arnold, $2,400 to Travis Arnold, $2,800 to Bobbie Arnold, and $400 for physical and mental suffering. However, the railway company appealed, questioning the legal foundation of Leonard Arnold's dependency and compensation that extended beyond his age of majority, as well as the assertion that the railway employee’s injury was the proximate cause of his death from pneumonia.

The central issues in the appeal were the proper filing and timing of appeal bond and transcript, the adequacy of the pleadings regarding dependency and pecuniary loss, particularly concerning an ""afflicted"" child, and whether the injury was indeed the proximate cause of death.","The verdict of the appeal court can be anticipated to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings. This decision would likely rest on the court's analysis of the pleadings and the instructions given to the jury at trial. The court finds that the term ""afflicted"" used in the pleadings to describe one of the children, Leonard Arnold, does not adequately demonstrate his individual pecuniary loss or level of dependency on the deceased father's support, as required under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Furthermore, the appellate court may hold that the evidence related to Leonard's capacity to work and thus support himself was insufficient under the law, as the pleadings failed to define the nature of his affliction and did not claim an inability to earn a living.

Concerning the evidential connection between the injury and the employee's death, the court can determine that the trial court erroneously assumed negligence in its instructions to the jury, which should have been a vigorously contested question of fact and not a presumption. The appeal court might also agree with the railway company that the trial court did not properly address the railway’s defense theory, that the deceased's contributory negligence and failure to seek medical attention were factors that aggravated the initial injury and were not the proximate cause of death.

As a result, the verdict may well highlight that because of these legal errors, particularly the insufficient pleadings and incorrect jury instructions regarding dependency, pecuniary loss, and the issue of negligence, the jury's verdict cannot stand. While the evidence on the issue of proximate cause might be found sufficient to support the jury's verdict, errors identified in the proceedings would compel the court to reverse and remand the case for a new trial, allowing for proper pleadings and jury instructions in line with the stipulations of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and case law interpretations."
"Appellee Freddy Moreno Jr., a police officer with the Anthony Police Department, was indicted for violating the civil rights of a prisoner and released on a $1,000 bond. Moreno enlisted the appellant, attorney Francisco F. Macias, for his defense. Macias failed to inform Moreno about the final judge's conference, leading to Moreno's absence at the hearing. Consequently, the trial court revoked Moreno's bond and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno spent three weeks in jail following this due to unsuccessful attempts by Macias to have the bond reduced. After Moreno dismissed Macias, he hired another attorney, Anthony Gonzalez, and the charges against him were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence.

Moreno then sued Macias for legal malpractice, specifically alleging negligence, violations of the DTPA, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeking attorney's fees. The jury only considered the negligence claim and found Macias to be 90 percent responsible for Moreno's damages, assessing damages for mental anguish, lost wages, and legal fees paid to both Gonzalez and Macias. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Moreno for $39,150.

Macias raised three main issues for appeal: 1) whether Texas law prohibits maintaining a malpractice suit for damages arising from criminal charges without a conviction, 2) whether the trial court erred in refusing his requests for jury determinations regarding Moreno's guilt and related instructions on sole proximate cause of damages, and 3) whether the ""unlawful act rule"" bars Moreno's claims due to his failure to appear in court.

During the trial, Macias argued that Moreno's alleged criminal conduct was the sole proximate cause of the damages rather than any negligence by Macias. Macias also contended that because Moreno's absence from the conferenc was illegal, the unlawful act rule should bar his recovery for damages. Macias' arguments in court were based on disputing the causal link between his actions and Moreno's damages, suggesting Moreno's misconduct (alleged criminal acts and failure to appear) was the true cause.","The court will affirm the judgment against Macias, upholding the jury's verdict awarding damages to Moreno. The appellant Macias waived his sole proximate cause argument by failing to properly plead in his defense that Moreno's criminal conduct was the sole cause of damages incurred. Moreover, the doctrine of sole proximate cause was not applicable because it only pertains to cases where the client was convicted, which did not occur for Moreno since his charges were dismissed.

The court will also maintain that the requested instructions and jury questions regarding Moreno's guilt and causation were not supported by the pleadings and evidence, making them improper and unsupportable by law. Thus, Macias was not entitled to these submissions, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to include such instructions for the jury.

Regarding the issue of the ""unlawful act rule,"" since Moreno was not convicted, the act of failing to appear at the conference alone, without evidence of charging for bail jumping or an admission of the act, does not trigger the rule to bar recovery for malpractice damages. The negligence claim against Macias remained independent of any alleged unlawful acts by Moreno.

In conclusion, since all of Macias' issues are overruled, the appellate court sustains the jury's verdict and Macias' appeal will not succeed. The judgment in favor of Moreno is thus affirmed."
"Alicean R. Kalteyer and her husband Charles F. Kalteyer filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Dennis R. Sneed, alleging injuries resulting from a corticosteroid injection and an X-ray administered in April 1988. The treatment in question was noted to have followed a previous adverse reaction that Ms. Kalteyer experienced from a similar steroid injection given by a different doctor. Her aversion to injections and adverse reactions to medications were documented, along with treatment for other medical issues. The Kalteyers asserted that Ms. Kalteyer experienced numbness and difficulty walking after the shot on April 15 and developed numerous symptoms after the X-ray on April 29, including eye problems, discoloration, hair loss, and other discomforts.

The lawsuit was filed in June 1990. The appellants sought multiple postponements, and Dr. Sneed eventually filed a motion for summary judgment on June 11, 1990. This was granted on August 5, 1991. The Kalteyers filed a motion for a new trial, arguing expert testimony was not necessary to counter the summary judgment, which was denied, as well as two amended motions for a new trial that were also deemed untimely and hence denied. The Kalteyers contended that the trial court erred by not considering their motions and by granting Dr. Sneed's motion for summary judgment, alleging that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should apply and raise an issue of fact regarding negligence.","The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment awarded to Dr. Dennis R. Sneed. The reasoning for this verdict will be that although the application of res ipsa loquitur might suggest an issue of fact concerning negligence, it is insufficient to establish proximate cause between the treatments and the resulting injuries. The court is predicted to highlight that expert evidence is essential to demonstrate a causal connection between the medical treatment and the adverse effects experienced by the patient. Simply put, an expert's evaluation of the medical records could reveal that the treatment could not have caused the reported symptoms, making the lay evaluation submitted by the appellants inadequate. 

Additionally, the denial of the appellants' motions for a new trial will be justified based on procedural grounds, namely that they were untimely under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(b)), thus the trial court did not act in an abuse of discretion. The court is likely to stress that any amended motion filed after the 30-day period, but within the trial court's plenary power, would rely on the court's willingness to consider it for guidance, which did not happen in this case. Even if the motions could be filed later with the court's leave, they were not, and the substantive rulings by the trial court on these motions were consistent with established legal precedents. Therefore, the appellants' points of error will be overruled, and the original judgment in favor of appellee Dr. Sneed will be upheld, based on the reasoning contained within the case details."
"General Chemical Corporation manufactures a chemical product called sodium metabisulfite, used by shrimpers to preserve the color of shrimp after it is caught and referred to in the industry as ""shrimp dip."" The decedents, brothers Gustavo and Jose De La Lastra, worked as commercial fishermen using this product regularly. In July 1988, the brothers died from asphyxiation by sulfur dioxide gas while using the product on their fishing vessel, the ""Wilderness,"" near Brownsville, Texas. The sufficiency of the product’s warning labels was brought into question. Expert testimony at the trial indicated that while the label on the product mentioned it could be toxic, it did not specifically warn that it could produce a poisonous lethal gas when applied to wet ice, which was below the chemical industry standard.

The jury heard evidence that the company had prior knowledge of other deaths caused by the same chemical and did not change the warning label accordingly. Testimony revealed a recommendation from the United States Coast Guard to the company's predecessor in 1973, advising them to warn users of the chemical about the dangers when used aboard vessels, specifically the potential to release lethal sulfur dioxide gas. These prior incidents had not led to changes in the warning labels.

Other evidence showed that the decedents resided with their parents, had a close familial relationship, and contributed all of their income to the household, sharing in many family activities. The trial also detailed the events leading to their deaths and the physical and emotional pain they suffered during the poisoning process, which ultimately led to their asphyxiation.","The court upheld the trial court judgment awarding actual and exemplary damages to the decedents' parents. The jury's findings regarding the inadequacy of the warning labels are expected to be supported based on the detailed evidence including expert testimony, demonstrating that the warnings did not specify the fatal risks of the product. The evidence of General Chemical's knowledge of past deaths and lack of subsequent action to modify the warnings would support the jury's determination that this constitutes ""gross negligence,"" justifying an award for exemplary damages.

Given the emotional and financial contributions of the decedents to their parents' lives, the courts would likely find the claims for wrongful death to be reasonable. The pecuniary and non-pecuniary awards including loss of companionship and society, and mental anguish, would be upheld in light of the details of the previously close parent-child relationship and the substantial impact of the loss on the parents' lives, which was supported by psychological expert testimony and firsthand accounts.

The court would likely also reject the constitutional challenge raised by General Chemical against the exemplary damages awarded, as previous precedent and statutory law provide sufficient due process protections for defendants in such cases. The court's rationale would probably emphasize that Texas law affords defendants a number of procedural safeguards and that the current system does not violate due process or equal protection clauses of the Constitution. Given the significant evidence of the company's conscious indifference and failure to warn about the life-threatening dangers of their product, such an award would be seen as a necessary punitive measure and deterrent against future negligence."
"H.T. Staggs was an employee of Skelly Oil Company, supervised and repaired the company's pumping plant engines, and lived on the company's property. He worked almost all night on October 31, 1935, and returned home the next morning. After eating breakfast, he descended the steps of his home, fell, and hit his head on a concrete block. Despite the fall, he proceeded to the pumping plant for work. Later that morning, after failing to respond to a call from the superintendent, Staggs was discovered dead on the pumping plant's office floor. 

The widow filed a lawsuit seeking workmen's compensation, alleging that Staggs' fall and the subsequent inhalation of carbon monoxide gas from a leaked engine at the pumping plant contributed to his death. An autopsy indicated the death was due to cerebral hemorrhage caused by high blood pressure and pre-existing conditions, which a physician believed could have existed for months or years. A physician for the defense opined that the injury from the fall contributed to the death, a conclusion that the Court of Civil Appeals found supportable based on the jury's finding.

The jury found that Staggs fell and injured his head, which contributed to his death, and that the injury happened in the course of employment. Additionally, they determined he had inhaled carbon monoxide gas, sustaining injury from it which also contributed to his death whilst in the domain of his employment.

The Court of Civil Appeals concluded there was no evidence for the carbon monoxide inhalation contributing to his death. Plaintiff in error argued for a requirement of evidence supporting both causes (fall and gas) contributing to the death, whereas the defendants in error contended that evidence for head injury as a cause was sufficient for compensation.

Texas compensation law does not demand showings of injury as the sole cause of disability/death or that it proximately caused death. Compensation law broadly covers ""producing cause"" of injury leading to disability or death in the employment context. The statutory and legal context defends compensation even when an injury contributes to disability/death alongside an existing disease or second injury.","The court's judgment will be in favor of the widow's claim for her husband's death. It will be concluded that, while the evidence surrounding the carbon monoxide poisoning does not support the cause of death, it is not material to the compensation claim as long as there is evidence to support the finding that the head injury was a producing cause of death.

The verdict will center on the notion of ""producing cause,"" implying compensation law does not require sole causation but rather an injury's contribution as a causative factor. The jury's findings that the injury from the head injury was a producing cause of death, independent of the findings about carbon monoxide poisoning, are sufficient to uphold the compensation claim.

The court will recognize the established legal principle that in common-law negligence cases, as well as in workers' compensation claims, multiple contributing causes do not negate the responsibility of each contributing factor. The jury's findings that the head injury was a producing cause of death and occurred in the course of Staggs's employment provide an adequate legal basis for compensation, despite other non-supported findings related to carbon monoxide. The court will disregard the findings related to the gas as they are not supported by evidence, and the remaining valid findings will suffice to award compensation to the plaintiff, reflecting the broader purpose of the workers' compensation law to provide relief for employment-related injuries regardless of other concurrent causes.

Additionally, the court's reasoning will align with previous case law that endorses compensation awards where pre-existing conditions or multiple injuries contribute to the resultant harm. The concept of concurrent causation will be pivotal, confirming that the law aims to address the realities of compound factors in workplace injuries and the actual contribution of employment-related harm."
"The background of this case involves an incident in a store owned by the appellant employer, Grand Leader Dry Goods Company, Inc., resulting in injuries to two employees, appellee Kathryn M. Caveness and another employee, Mrs. Bradshaw. The case occurred on April 21, 1965, in Huntsville, Texas. The incident in question began when Mrs. Bradshaw, an employee of the store like Mrs. Caveness, fell over an open filing cabinet drawer that had been negligently left open, resulting in her legs being pinned by the drawer and the counter, as well as a severe cut and profuse bleeding from an apparent severed artery. Mrs. Caveness moved a heavy display counter, weighing several hundred pounds, to rescue Mrs. Bradshaw but injured her back severely during the process.

For a significant period prior to the incident, concerns had been raised about the narrow space between the display counter and the filing cabinet, with Mrs. Caveness having previously mentioned the safety issue to the store manager, Louie Cohn. At the time of the accident, the distance between them was a mere 18 1/2 inches when the filing cabinet drawers were closed. Mrs. Caveness had to undergo extended hospitalization and treatment for her injuries.

The lawsuit was filed against the employer since it did not have a workmen's compensation policy, which resulted in the employer being unable to invoke defenses such as contributory negligence, negligence of a fellow servant, and assumed risk.

The jury found the employer negligent for several reasons: leaving the drawer open, failing to provide a safe workspace, and that each of these negligent actions were proximate causes of the injuries sustained by Mrs. Caveness.","Anticipating the reasoning for upholding the verdict in favor of the appellees, Kathryn M. Caveness and her husband, it will be based on the jury findings which are supported by the evidence that was presented. The evidence will have demonstrated that the appellant's employees operated in an unsafe workspace, and that the conditions created by this environment were a direct result of the employer's negligence. The foreseeability of an injury occurring as a consequence of the negligence will also play a critical role in the affirmation of the verdict. The fact that one employee might attempt to aid another in peril was a natural and likely outcome of the employer's negligent act of allowing the drawer to remain open and thus will be seen as an event that the employer should have reasonably anticipated under the circumstances.

Furthermore, since Mrs. Bradshaw was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident, her actions are considered to be those of the employer, and, as the employer was a non-subscriber to Workmen's Compensation, the employer will be held to a strict liability standard concerning employee injury. The verdict will support the idea that employers have a duty to maintain a safe work environment and can be held liable for foreseeable harm that arises from a failure to uphold that duty. The court will affirm the lower court's judgment for appellees based on these grounds, rejecting any claim of juror misconduct raised by the appellant as either irrelevant to the lawsuit or not constituting reversible error since some jurors did not hear the allegedly prejudicial statement or because it did not affect the outcome of the case."
"Mary Louise Hudman, the appellee beneficiary, brought a lawsuit against Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Association, the appellant insurance company, seeking benefits under a life insurance policy for her deceased husband, Paul B. Hudman. Paul Hudman, a 54-year-old pharmacist, died while driving his pickup truck after a day of performing physical labor on his farms on an abnormally hot day. On the day of his death, he and his son engaged in extensive physical work, including loading and unloading heavy materials. 

Paul Hudman drove a Chevrolet Fleetside pickup truck, which was used for personal and family transportation. The truck was licensed in Texas as a ""farm truck"" and had been seen as a private passenger automobile by the Hudman family. Having never been diagnosed with or treated for heart disease, Paul appeared to be in good health before his death. However, he died from ventricular fibrillation, which the trial court found was induced by unusual physical exertion on a particularly hot and humid day—an accidental bodily injury by the policy's definition. The autopsy revealed that Paul had substantial arteriosclerotic heart disease, more advanced than typical for his age, which had been developing for years.

The trial court determined in favor of Mary Louise Hudman, awarding her the principal policy sum, interest, statutory penalty, and attorney's fees, with additional fees if the case was appealed. The insurance company contested these findings, arguing that the pickup truck didn't qualify as a ""private passenger automobile"" as specified in the policy, and that Paul Hudman's pre-existing heart condition was not merely a predisposing condition but a proximal cause of his death.","In affirming the trial court decision, the court will address the appellant's points of contestation. First, regarding whether the pickup truck qualified as a ""private passenger automobile"" within the terms of the insurance policy, the court will find no error in the trial court's ruling. The judgment will be based on the appearance and use of the vehicle, common experiences, and the premise that the insurance company could have specifically restricted coverage to cars designed exclusively for the transportation of passengers but did not.

On the second point, challenging the finding that Paul Hudman's arteriosclerosis was a predisposing condition rather than a proximal cause, the court will consider expert medical testimony. Although Paul's heart disease contributed to his death, there is sufficient evidence to support the ruling that the physical exertions under the weather conditions on the day of his death were the proximate cause of the fatal ventricular fibrillation. Contrary medical opinions were presented, but the trial judge had the authority to make judgments based on the weight of credible evidence, and the expert testimony offered did not decisively refute the court's findings.

Lastly, the court will decide that an unexpected reaction of the body to unusual physical exertion constitutes an accidental bodily injury under the policy. Since the fibrillation, which ultimately caused Hudman's death, occurred while he was driving the pickup, the act of driving itself was a part of the physical exertion contributing to the fibrillation. Consequently, the court will find no merit in the argument that Paul Hudman’s death did not result from an accidental bodily injury sustained while riding in his pickup truck.

Overall, the court will affirm the judgment in favor of the appellee beneficiary, Mary Louise Hudman, as there will be considered ample evidence that the insured's death was caused by ventricular fibrillation resulting from unusual physical exertion, and even though a predisposing condition contributed to the death, it was not the proximate cause."
"The case involved appellant parents who brought a wrongful death and survival action against the City of Brownsville following the suicide of their son, Ricardo Serna Alvarado, while he was in the city jail. On November 10, 1988, Ricardo, a 19-year-old high school student, committed suicide by hanging himself with a jail-issued blanket after being arrested for driving while intoxicated. Earlier that day, he had been agitated due to romantic rejection.

Officer Jose Angel Rodriguez, who arrested Ricardo after a collision, testified that Ricardo did not appear suicidal. Jailers Ignacio ""Nacho"" Perez and Javier Elizondo provided conflicting testimony about Ricardo's state and the level of intoxication. Jail policy required cell checks every 20 minutes, with more frequent checks for at-risk inmates, yet on the night of Ricardo's death, the jailers failed to adhere to this policy. Instead, they prioritized booking procedures over cell checks, which led to a delayed discovery of Ricardo's body. Neither jailer administered CPR while waiting for paramedics.

The only theory of negligence submitted to the jury was the breach of the city's self-imposed duty to perform scheduled twenty-minute cell checks, as per the Jail Procedures Manual. However, the jury found that the City was not negligent and that Ricardo's own actions were the proximate cause of his death.

During trial, the appellant parents had several theories of liability and related evidence excluded by the trial court, based on the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), which the parents claimed was error. They argued that the rejected evidence involved the implementation of city policies such as screening for suicidal inmates, inadequate training, and the failure to administer CPR, rather than the formulation of the policies protected by the TTCA.

The appellant parents raised multiple points of error regarding the jury's verdict, the trial court's submission of the charge, the exclusion of certain evidence, and claims that the evidence excluded under the TTCA did not involve the condition or use of tangible property or fall within the discretionary or police protection exemptions.","The court will reverse and remand the case for a new trial. The reasoning will be threefold, focusing on the errors in the judge's charge to the jury, the exclusion of relevant evidence, and the insufficiency of evidence to support the jury's verdict.

Firstly, the jury charge on the suicide defense will be determined to be improper, as under Texas law, Section 93.001 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code, a plaintiff's suicide cannot be used as a defense if the suicide was caused in whole or in part by a defendant's breach of legal duty. The submission of question two regarding Ricardo's negligence or intentional conduct causing his own death will be deemed confusing and misleading, as it turned a necessary fact for the appellants to prove (suicide) into a comparative negligence issue.

Secondly, the exclusion of evidence under the exceptions to the waiver of governmental immunity provided by the TTCA will be deemed as reversible error. The information pertaining to the city's failure to train jailers for suicide prevention, their inadequate screening of potentially suicidal inmates, the failure to administer CPR, and the lack of placement of video cameras in the detention areas of the jail will be seen as relevant to the implementation of city policy. This evidence was essential to the appellant's case, and its exclusion was therefore harmful and likely affected the trial outcome.

Lastly, there will be a consideration of whether the evidence excluded under the discretionary acts or police protection exemptions pertains to policy implementation. It will be found that the excluded testimony and documents were related to the implementation of policy rather than to policy formulation. Excluding this evidence was harmful and probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment because it prevented the jury from considering the full scope of the City's alleged negligence concerning the death of Ricardo Alvarado.

Overall, the combination of these errors will lead to a decision that a reversal is warranted to ensure a fair trial, and the court will remand the case for a new trial, where the excluded evidence will be expected to be admitted."
"The guests, R. W. Cosby and Elizabeth D. Wallace, filed a personal injury lawsuit following a fire at the Hotel Longview on March 29, 1934, against two defendants: the Texas Hotel Company of Longview, which owned and operated the hotel, and the National Hotel Company, which the guests alleged owned and used the Texas Hotel Company as a dummy corporation and was effectively operating the hotel through it. The incident involved the guests jumping from a third-story window to escape the fire, resulting in injuries. They claimed the fire originated in the hotel porter's closet and that the hotel's employees failed to properly warn them or to immediately call the fire department. The jury found that both the Texas Hotel Company and the National Hotel Company were liable, awarding $15,000 in damages to the plaintiffs. They found the Texas Hotel Company was indeed under the control of the National Hotel Company, and the hotel's employees were negligent in failing to warn the plaintiffs and immediately call the fire department, which was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. Additionally, the jury found negligence in the operation of the porter's closet and that the starting of the fire was not due to an unavoidable accident.","The court will order that the guests' personal injury action against the National Hotel Company be dismissed. The rationale for this decision will rest on a precedent case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, in which the same legal issues and facts were considered. The Texas appellate court in the Motley case previously concluded that the National Hotel Company was not liable, and this judgment has been approved by the Supreme Court, effectively setting a binding precedent.

Regarding the Texas Hotel Company and its liability towards the safety of its guests, while it is bound by the duty to exercise reasonable care, there will be further analysis required to establish negligence relevant to the circumstances. Concerning the failure to immediately call the fire department and failure to warn the guests, the court will reason that, due to the sudden and fierce nature of the fire and given the available equipment at the time, the hotel staff's actions, such as knocking on doors and shouting fire, were prima facie responses under the emergent conditions. Moreover, inconsistencies in witness testimonies regarding the alleged delay in calling the fire department, as well as speculative evidence about the porter’s closet operation, will lead to a conclusion that establishing proximate cause between alleged negligence and the plaintiffs' injuries is untenable.

The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows the presumption of negligence from the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents, will be deemed inapplicable in this scenario since the cause of the fire was not indicated by the evidence, and no presumption of negligence arises from the mere occurrence of a fire.

The verdict against the Texas Hotel Company will likely be reversed for insufficient evidence of negligence directly causing the plaintiffs’ injuries, and the case will be remanded for a new trial, where additional evidence or arguments not likely to arise in the same form will be presented. As for the National Hotel Company, the judgment will be reversed with a decision that the plaintiffs take nothing from this defendant."
"Appellant North American Refractories Company (NARCO), a manufacturer of asbestos-containing products, is involved in an appeal concerning consolidated actions from appellees Frederick Moss, Martin Easter, both retired engineers from Alabama, their spouses, and Sam Roberts, a boilermaker. The appellees alleged personal injuries and loss of consortium due to exposure to asbestos from the appellant's products. Specifically, Moss and Easter claimed to have contracted mesothelioma, while Roberts asserted he developed asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease. Moss died from his illness, and his lawsuit was continued by representatives of his estate. NARCO was the only remaining defendant at trial after most others settled.

During the trial, there was evidence presented of frequent contact by the appellees with asbestos from the appellant's products, lack of warnings or labels on the products despite knowledge of the dangers, and how the dust emitted from mixing, spraying, and tearing out the appellant's products contained dangerous levels of asbestos. The case was tried under Alabama law and involved both negligence and product liability theories under the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine, which requires a manufacturer to ensure products are not unreasonably dangerous. The jury found NARCO liable under both theories, concluding that the company's products proximately caused the appellees' injuries.","Considering the legal and factual evidence presented at trial, it is expected that the court will affirm the decision of the trial court, holding NARCO liable for damages. The verdict will be rooted in the fact that there was substantial evidence showing that not only were the appellant's products a proximate cause of the appellees' injuries, but also that the frequency, regularity, and proximity of exposure were sufficiently demonstrated. Additionally, the expert testimonies regarding the health effects of asbestos exposure will be seen as sufficiently credible and detailed to justify the compensatory damages awarded to each of the appellees, without any indication that the jury's decision was influenced by passion or sympathy.

The consolidation of the actions will likely be deemed appropriate given the commonalities among the appellees' cases, including the type of injuries claimed, their similar occupations, and the overlapping time periods of their asbestos exposure. The appellate court will probably find no unfair prejudice against the appellant due to consolidation. Punitive damages awarded will be considered proper as the appellant's conduct will be viewed as showing a reckless disregard for public health, further warranting punitive measures. The amount of punitive damages, when evaluated against the compensatory damages and the reprehensibility of the appellant's conduct, will not be considered constitutionally excessive.

The court will likely affirm the trial court's decision to admit or exclude particular evidence, finding no abuse of discretion or showing that any evidentiary error likely caused an improper judgment. Similarly, potential errors in the apportionment of settlement credits, if conceded by the appellant as having no effect on the total damages for which they are liable, will be regarded as moot and not addressed in the verdict. Overall, the evidence of causation, the severity of appellees' injuries, the appellant's reprehensible conduct, and the detailed nature of the claims presented will be considered well-founded to support the jury's decision, resulting in an affirmation of the trial court's judgment."
"Diana Cruz, individually and as next friend, filed a medical malpractice suit against Paso Del Norte Health Foundation, previously known as Providence Memorial Hospital, for injuries her son Sergio Cruz, Jr., allegedly sustained during labor. The case centered around the alleged negligence of two labor and delivery nurses, who Cruz claimed failed to properly monitor and interpret the baby's fetal heart rate during labor. Cruz arrived at the Providence emergency room in active labor as a ""no-doctor patient,"" meaning she wasn't accompanied by her own doctor and hospital staff was unfamiliar with her medical history. The nurses attached an external fetal heart monitor and administered various standard protocols based on the hospital's guidelines when nonreassuring heart rate patterns appeared.

The baby was delivered by C-section with the umbilical cord wrapped tightly around his neck and shoulders, and he was found to be severely brain-damaged. Cruz's suit originally included the doctor and nurse, but they were non-suited before trial, leaving only the hospital as the defendant. Cruz contented that the nurses failed to recognize nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns and did not notify the attending obstetrician, Dr. Tomasino, in a timely and urgent manner. Cruz argued that this negligence resulted in the lack of prompt intervention—specifically, an emergency C-section—that could have prevented Sergio's brain injury.

During the trial, several expert witnesses testified, with varying opinions regarding the timing and cause of the injury. The plaintiff's experts widely agreed that the injuries were the result of hypoxic ischemic events occurring during labor. The defense experts offered a range of alternative theories, including injury prior to hospital admission, intrauterine growth retardation, seizures after birth, embolism, and infection.","Affirming the judgment in favor of the defendant, Providence, the intermediate appellate court was bound by its judicial limits to uphold the jury's original decision. The court determined that the jury's failure to find the nurses' alleged negligence as a proximate cause of Sergio's injuries was not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence presented at trial. Applying the law of fact-finding and credibility assessments, which are primary functions of a jury, the court pointed out it may not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury.

The reasoning for the verdict would include considerations of the evidentiary record, acknowledging the conflicting expert testimonies on both negligence and causation. The jury's role as the sole arbiter of witness credibility and the weight of their testimony implies that even in the face of seemingly convincing arguments for Cruz's position, the verdict stands if there is competent evidence of a probative force that supports the jury's findings. It respects the jury's discretion in whom to credit among the experts who presented various causation theories, some of which suggested the injuries occurred outside the nurses' care window and some that proposed alternative explanations for the injuries. The appellate court must affirm the trial court's judgment unless the appellant demonstrates that the jury's adverse finding on an issue for which the appellant bore the burden of proof, is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, which was not the case here. Consequently, the appellate court upheld the jury's verdict favoring the hospital, and the take-nothing judgment was maintained."
"This legal case involves a negligence lawsuit brought by the appellant survivors of Mrs. Mary Ellyson against an appellee railroad company. Mrs. Ellyson had initially filed an injury action after sustaining injuries from a collision between a passenger train, on which she was a passenger, and a freight train operated by the defendant railroad company. The collision was due to the railroad company's negligence, causing Mrs. Ellyson to suffer bruises on her head and arm, and a broken left thigh. Mrs. Ellyson experienced mental and physical pain due to these injuries before passing away on December 1, 1902.

After her death, the survivors (appellants), who are her children, updated their complaint by asserting they incurred expenses for Mrs. Ellyson's medical services, nurse hire, and medicine. The trial court, however, sustained a demurrer to the survivors' amended petition because it did not state that Mrs. Ellyson's death was not a consequence of the injuries she suffered. As a response, the plaintiffs amended the petition to clarify that the injuries were not the direct or proximate cause of her death, suggesting alternative causes such as diarrhea and bowel trouble, which may have been aggravated by her injuries but were not necessarily the primary cause of death.

The evidence indicated that Mrs. Ellyson's death could have resulted from the effects of diarrhea and bowel trouble, or the concurring effects of the bowel trouble and her collision injuries. However, some evidence suggested that her bowel trouble was the proximate, prominent, and efficient cause of death, and the injuries may have only slightly contributed to the outcome. The trial court required the survivors to prove that Mrs. Ellyson's death was not the result of the injuries sustained in the train collision in order to recover any damages.

The core of the survivors' argument hinged on article 3353a of Sayles' Civil Statutes, which allows a cause of action to survive for personal injuries that do not result in death. The statute does not allow for survival of the cause of action in cases where personal injuries resulted in death. The appellants sought to recover damages incurred during Mrs. Ellyson's last illness, contending that the cause of action should survive regardless of whether her death was attributed to the injuries sustained in the collision.","The court will reverse the judgment of the lower court and remand the cause for a new trial due to the incorrect instructions given to the jury and the misapplication of the law on concurrent causation. The court will base its reversal on the fact that the trial court's charge incorrectly allowed the jury to consider that the injuries sustained in the train collision could be considered the cause of Mrs. Ellyson's death, even if they only partly contributed, along with the diarrhea or bowel disease, to her demise. To properly attribute death to concurrent causes, the court will emphasize that each cause must have been a prominent, efficient one.

The jury instructions will be observed as having misled the jurors into believing that even slight injuries contributing to death could be considered proximate causes. The court will highlight the principle that only the proximate, prominent, and efficient causes should be attributed to the outcome, and any slight contributing factors should not be deemed the cause of death if they did not amount to a proximate cause.

For the errors in charging the jury, the court will find fault with the lower court's decision, thus granting the survivors a new trial. During this trial, the jury will need to be instructed to consider the entire context of both the injuries from the collision and the subsequent bowel trouble, including their interplay before and after Mrs. Ellyson's injuries, in determining the cause of her death. Despite slight errors invited by the plaintiffs' special instructions, which the court will not use as a ground for reversal, the court will suggest that the new trial provide a broader scope for the jury's consideration of all relevant factors."
"The case involves an appeal by the appellant insurance company, Great American Health and Life Insurance Company, against a judgment in favor of the appellee, R. L. Lothringer, who sued on behalf of his wife, the insured, to recover under an accident policy issued by the appellant. The 156th District Court of Bee County, Texas, had previously granted judgment to Lothringer, awarding $6,000.00 jointly and severally against both Great American and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company, which had succeeded to Great American's rights. The jury-less trial led to an appeal by Great American, which did not agree with the decision. There were no findings of facts or conclusions of law included in that decision. 

The second trial of this cause was a result of a former judgment for appellee that had been reversed and remanded by the 10th Court of Civil Appeals. The accident policy in question provided for payments based on a disability caused solely by accidental means. The insured, Maymie L. Lothringer, alleged that she sustained a disabling injury after an accidental fall. However, the appellant provided evidence that the insured had a pre-existing arthritic condition that contributed to her disability.

The appellant's basis for appeal included six points of error, primarily contending that appellee failed to prove that the injury was independent of all other causes, that the insured was totally and continuously disabled, that the injury required the personal care and attendance of a legally qualified physician, that there was no evidence of probative value to support the judgment, that there were errors in admitting certain evidence, and objection to the overruling of appellant's motions for continuance.

Evidence presented at trial included the insurance policy, testimony from Mrs. Lothringer about her fall, the resulting injury, and her ongoing pain and disability since the incident. Additionally, depositions from two doctors, Dr. Sol Foreman and Dr. William H. Ainsworth, were presented, both indicating that the disability was caused by a combination of the fall and the pre-existing osteoarthritis.","Considering the evidence provided, the court will likely conclude that the appellee’s disability was not solely caused by accidental means independent of all other causes. The court will probably find that the accident and the pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis in Mrs. Lothringer's knee concurrently contributed to the disability. This would mean that the disability was not exclusively a result of the accident, which contravenes the policy provision requiring the disability to result solely from accidental causes. 

The court will likely rely on precedents establishing that where a policy limits its coverage to injuries being the sole cause of disability, the evidence must demonstrate that the disability occurred independently of other causes. Since both medical experts' testimonies suggest a pre-existing condition significantly contributing to the insured's disability, the court will probably rule that Mrs. Lothringer's condition does not fall within the coverage terms of the insurance policy.

The verdict will probably reverse the judgment against Great American Health & Life Insurance Company based on the reasoning that the insured did not meet the policy's requirement to establish proof of disability solely from an accident. Moreover, because the rights of Great American Health and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company are interwoven, the judgment against the non-appealing co-defendant, Texas Reserve Life, will also likely be reversed. The predicted outcome will be a ruling in favor of the appellant insurance company, rendering that the appellee takes nothing against them."
"Alberto Perez Jr. (""Albert""), a minor son of the plaintiff, reached out to the owners of ABC Lock and Key Company, Albert Lopez and Rachel Lopez, to make a new key for the trigger lock on his rifle after he lost the original key. Rachel informed him that she could not create a new key, but if Albert brought the unloaded rifle and proper identification to their shop, she could pick the lock. A conversation with a joking tone about the use of the gun ensued, with Rachel asking if Albert planned to rob anybody and Albert laughing off the inquiry, stating his intent to go hunting.

Albert Lopez, co-owner, attempted to verify with someone at Albert's home that he was the rightful possessor of the rifle but was unsuccessful. Despite the lack of verification, Rachel proceeded to pick the lock at her husband's instruction and returned the operational rifle to the minor after he paid a service fee.

The plaintiff had found the rifle which belonged to his older son in his house a week before Albert's suicide but did not secure it from his son. On the day Alberto Jr. committed suicide, the plaintiff took the rifle to work to potentially sell it to a colleague, found out the trigger lock was removed, and returned the rifle to where he found it, despite knowing his minor son would be at his house that day.

The plaintiff filed a wrongful death and survival action against the owners of the lock and key company, arguing that their negligence in unlocking the trigger lock and handing the now operational rifle back to his underage son without consent was a proximate cause of his son's subsequent suicide.

At trial, the plaintiff testified to suffering mental anguish and depression post the son's death, corroborated by professional medical opinions and observations by his daughter. Despite this, the jury awarded no damages for past or future mental anguish or loss of companionship to the plaintiff. The jury did find all parties negligent, apportioning responsibility 33% to Alberto Sr., and 34% and 33% to Albert and Rachel Lopez, respectively. It awarded the estate $5,000 for funeral and burial expenses. The defendants motioned for a directed verdict, claiming there was no evidence the suicide was foreseeable or that their actions were a proximate cause.","I predict that the appellate court will undertake a meticulous examination of the jury's decisions, the evidence presented, and pertinent legal principles before determining the verdict. In analyzing the verdict of no damages for mental anguish and loss of companionship, the appellate court will reiterate the established legal principle that the jurors, as the sole judges of credibility, have the discretion to weigh evidence and resolve conflicts within it. It will consider the testimony provided by both the plaintiff and supporting witnesses, weigh it against the jury's determination, and decide if the verdict was egregiously against the great weight of the evidence to an extent that it appears manifestly unjust. 

The court will likely scrutinize the ruling of the trial court concerning the evidentiary and jury instruction errors claimed by the appellant. Regarding the evidence excluded by the trial court, the appellate court will assess if an offer of proof was properly made and whether excluding the evidence was harmful enough to reverse. 

Regarding the jury instruction error concerning negligence per se based on Texas Penal Code Sections 46.01(3) and 46.06(a)(2), the appellate court will analyze whether the statutes at issue clearly define the conduct to be prohibited and whether the injury that occurred is the type of injury the statutes were designed to prevent.

For determining foreseeability in the case of the wrongful death, the appellate court will explore whether the defendants could have reasonably anticipated the minor misusing the firearm in such a way that might have led to his suicide. They will consider if the defendants' actions were a substantial factor in the death, whether the suicide was a danger that a person of ordinary intelligence should have anticipated due to their negligence, and whether the injury's general character could have been anticipated.

In the end, the court will conclude whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence and proximate cause, and whether the jury's determination that no damages should be awarded was disproportionate to the evidence of the plaintiff's mental anguish and loss of companionship. If the court finds the jury's verdict was just and supported by the evidence, they will affirm the trial court's judgment; otherwise, they may reverse the judgment and opt for a new trial if procedural errors significantly affected the trial's outcome or the judgment rendered was manifestly unjust."
"The case concerns a husband (appellee) who filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Hunt, Texas, to seek compensation for injuries his wife allegedly sustained due to the negligence of a railroad company (appellant). The appellant railroad permitted a passenger coach to become and remain cold, which resulted in the wife becoming chilled, numb, and ill. The wife had taken the appellant's train for a journey when she experienced the claimed negligent conditions. She had been escorted to the coach by the railroad's agent, along with her three young children, in the evening, to await her departing train. The heat in the coach, which had a fire lit early in the evening, died down between ten and eleven o'clock, and the railroad staff did not take steps to renew the fire or reheat the coach until the morning after the train had left. During this time, the wife complained about the cold to one of the railroad staff, who did not take any action in response. Consequently, the wife allegedly developed a deep-seated cough, high fever, and physical pain, which purportedly led to her permanent injuries and the development of consumption (tuberculosis).

During the trial, the railroad company argued that the wife should have taken steps to protect herself by seeking warmth elsewhere once the coach became cold. However, the court charged the jury that the railroad company was expected to exercise an exceptional degree of care to ensure the comfort and safety of passengers - a degree of care that very cautious and prudent persons would exercise under similar circumstances.

The wife had testified in detail about her journey, her physical condition before and after the incident, and the lack of appropriate response from the railroad staff. Medical testimony supported the wife's statements regarding the potential consequences of exposure to severe cold and suggested a connection between her exposure and the subsequent development of her illness.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the wife for $7,300, which led to the railroad seeking a review of the judgment.","The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the husband. In reaching its decision, the court will likely have found that the railroad company did indeed owe the wife a high degree of care as her bailee during the journey, which involved protecting her from the inclement weather in the coach. It will also be found that this duty was breached when the coach became cold and no efforts were made to remedy the situation. The rule of care applied by the court as part of the jury charge will be deemed appropriate given the circumstances of the case, aligning with the established principle that railway companies must provide such care to passengers.

The court will likely have rejected the appellant's suggestions that the wife's symptoms after the incident, including her consumption, could have been caused by unrelated factors. Instead, the verdict will be supported by evidence and testimony showing that the wife was in good health prior to the incident and that her severe cold, developing illness, and subsequent symptoms were proximately caused by the negligence of the railroad company in keeping the passenger coach heated. Additionally, the verdict will not be seen as awarding double damages, as the jury will be understood to have been capable of distinguishing between compensation for immediate suffering in the coach and for the longer-term consequences of the cold exposure.

In light of the testimony and the applicable legal principles, it will be established that the preponderance of the evidence supports the verdict in favor of the passenger. Assertions that the wife was contributorily negligent for not seeking out warmer conditions elsewhere will not be found persuasive, as the railroad had the duty to provide a warm environment on the coach where she was to await her train. Although there were witnesses from the railroad company who claimed the coach was kept warm and comfortable, the jury will have been justified in accepting the wife's account and the corroborating medical testimony regarding her conditions pre- and post-journey. Any omissions in the railroad's evidence, such as the absence of testimony from the conductor and porter who moved the wife to the sleeper, will further weaken the railroad's case. Thus, the judgment in favor of the wife will stand affirmed, and the railroad's writ of error refused."
"This case pertains to P.F. and J.F., as next friends of their daughter, I.F., collectively referred to as Irsia, suing the defendants referred to as Dad, Junior, and Debbie for negligence and negligence per se in connection with sexual assaults committed by A.V. (Alvin), I.G. (Ivan), and J.A. (Joe) during a party at which Irsia was the victim. The party, hosted by Junior and supervised by Debbie, involved the consumption of alcohol and marijuana by ninth graders, and the attendance grew to about twenty to thirty males and four females, including Irsia. Dad, the father of Junior and Debbie, was away at the time, attending a college event. He had forbidden his children from having guests over during his absence, but his directive was disregarded. Junior organized the get-together with the anticipation of alcohol consumption, and among those invited were Alvin, Irsia, and other boys including Ivan and Joe. Debbie, upon discovering the party was happening, opted to supervise rather than stop it.

Debbie took some intoxicated children home during the party, and while she was away, Irsia became extremely intoxicated and was sexually assaulted by Alvin and possibly Ivan in the front or side yard of the home, followed by a sexual act with Joe. May, another supervisor, was aware of what was happening and informed Debbie but only locked the front door from the inside. Before these events, Alvin had been involved in a sexual act with Annette in the bathroom, which many at the party, including Junior and Irsia, knew about and which was publicly laughed at by attendees. Despite this knowledge, Debbie walked away from the situation in the bathroom after deeming it ""disgusting.""

The primary legal questions involve whether Dad, Debbie, and Junior, as hosts of the party, had a duty to act with care towards the event's attendees, and if so, whether their actions or inactions were the proximate cause of the assaults, as well as addressing the issue of superseding cause due to the criminal acts of Alvin, Ivan, and Joe.","The trial court affirmed part and reversed part of the judgment concerning the claims against Dad, Debbie, and Junior. As for Dad, the trial court's summary judgment was upheld because there was no evidence that Dad knew or approved of the party before leaving for the weekend or before the assault occurred. Hence, from Dad's standpoint, the criminal conduct of Alvin, Ivan, and Joe was a superseding cause of Irsia's injuries, and there was no material fact to suggest he could anticipate such an outcome.

However, the trial court's summary judgment denying recovery was reversed for the claims against Debbie and Junior as issues of fact existed regarding their potential negligence. The evidence suggested that during the party, Debbie and Junior exerted some level of control and oversight, which escalated to the point where Debbie considered herself mature enough to supervise the event and even reached out to May for help. Given her intent and efforts to monitor and even control certain behaviors like substance use and sexual conduct, a fact-finder could reasonably argue that Debbie assumed a duty to act with reasonable care, which may have been breached when she opted not to intervene more directly in clear instances of sexual activity (e.g., when Annette and Alvin were in the bathroom) and when the party escalated into a dangerous environment. Similarly, Junior had recognized the party's lack of control but failed to intervene further because he was drunk, essentially failing to exercise reasonable care expected from a supervising teen host.

The case raises material issues of fact regarding whether Debbie and Junior's failure to exercise care after assuming control of the attendees, particularly the underage teenagers consuming alcohol and engaging in sexual activities, contributed proximately to Irsia's eventual injuries. Therefore, Irsia is granted the reversal of summary judgment in terms of negligence against Debbie and Junior, allowing the case to proceed further in the lower court concerning their liability."
"Plaintiffs, composed of a temporary administrator, the surviving minor child, and others, sued defendant oil companies—Tex-Jersey Oil Corporation and Great Expectations Oil Company—after three decedents, Christine Beck and her two children Lorenzo and Elizabeth Beck, perished in a fire caused by an explosion of an oil storage tank. The tank was struck by lightning, leading to a fire that spread to the decedents' home, situated approximately 50 feet away. The decedents suffered pain and died as a result of the burns.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants negligently maintained the storage tanks by storing crude oil in tanks that were not vapor-proof and had open holes in the top. This, according to the plaintiffs, was a violation of Kilgore, Texas, General Oil Ordinance § 13, which stipulates that storage tanks must be vapor-proof and adequately connected to a foam generator. Plaintiffs argued that these negligent actions were the proximate cause of the deaths of Christine Beck and her children.

Evidence presented at trial showed that the tank was not vapor-proof, as admitted by Tex-Jersey and partially conceded by Great Expectations. Testimonies described that a vapor-proof tank is one that controls vapor release to prevent escape into the atmosphere. The jury found that the oil storage tanks had open holes, which contributed to the ignition by lightning, and that the defendants’ negligence was a proximate cause of the subsequent deaths. Other findings of the jury included that the accident was neither due to an act of God nor an unavoidable accident, and that specific amounts for damages were deemed fair for the survivor and for the pain and suffering of the decedents.

The defendants challenged the decision, arguing that the fire and explosion were caused by lightning, an act of God, and that the condition of the tank did not affect the inevitability of the tragedy. They also argued against the validity of the Kilgore ordinance and denied responsibility for negligence.","Observing the evidence presented, which included admissions regarding the storage tank's condition, testimonies about industry standards for vapor-proof tanks, and the circumstances of the lightning strike and the ensuing fire, a future court will likely affirm the trial court's ruling. The defendants will be found negligent for failing to abide by the Kilgore ordinance that mandates vapor-proof tanks, which constitutes negligence per se. A detailed interpretation of ""vapor-proof"" in the oil industry context will support the jury’s findings and the court’s decision that the tank was indeed required to be vapor-proof to prevent such accidents.

The evidence likely demonstrates that escape of gas vapors from the improperly maintained tank was ignited by the lightning, resulting in the deadly explosion and fire. Expert testimony will support the premise that a properly maintained vapor-proof tank would not have exploded upon a lightning strike. The court will reject the defense that the accident was unavoidable or solely attributable to an act of God, as the defendants should have anticipated and mitigated normal natural phenomena through proper tank maintenance.

Considering testimony regarding similar incidents, historical patterns for lightning strikes in the area, and the common knowledge that escaping vapors can be ignited by lightning, the court will likely conclude that the defendants had a duty to foresee such risks and act accordingly to prevent them. As such, it will be determined that the defendants' negligence, in conjunction with the lightning strike, was the proximate cause of death and suffering, thus affirming the trial court’s decision and awarding damages to the plaintiffs in accordance with the jury's findings. The defendants' remaining points will likely be overruled, as they do not present reversible error or sufficiently challenge the findings of law and facts established during the trial."
"The appellant, Christine H. DeLaurentis (Policyholder), purchased a renter's insurance policy from United Services Automobile Association a/k/a USAA (Insurer) in August 2000. In September 2000, she discovered water leaking from the air conditioning unit into her closet that resulted in the growth of black mold on a closet wall. The apartment complex reportedly repaired the leak and associated damage. However, by June 2001, the Policyholder found that the mold issue had not been resolved and had spread throughout her apartment, which prompted her to file a claim with the Insurer.

The City of Houston performed mold tests in July 2001 on her apartment, finding two types of mold. In pursuing her claim, the Policyholder was informed twice by Brenda Essex, a representative of the Insurer, that her mold damage claim would be denied as mold was not a named peril under her policy. Subsequently, during an inspection, claims investigator Candace Shook offered to pay for the water damage and relocation costs, but reiterated that coverage excluded mold damage. Shook requested an inventory of water-damaged property from the Policyholder, which was not furnished by her.

Subsequently, the Policyholder sued the Insurer alleging breach of contract, bad faith, and violations of the DTPA and the Texas Insurance Code. The court initially granted the Insurer's motion for summary judgment on the Policyholder's breach-of-contract claim, then on reconsideration, vacated the order, finally dismissing all of her claims. The Policyholder appealed, challenging 1) the absence of coverage for mold damage, 2) waiver of inventory request as a condition precedent, and 3) her entitlement to present additional extra-contractual claims.","The court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment regarding the breach of contract, bad-faith, and additional DTPA claims. The court will find that the Policyholder is not barred from filing a breach of contract suit because the insurer waived the requirement for a personal property inventory when it informed the Policyholder that mold was specifically excluded as a covered peril under the HOB-T policy. This waiver makes the condition precedent moot, and as such, it will be decided that the Policyholder should not be precluded from suing for breach of contract.

Further, the court will determine that the policy's language unambiguously provides coverage for mold damage caused by a leaking air conditioning unit. Since mold damage is not specifically excluded in the policy, and the damage arises from a named peril (water leak), the Insurer's coverage obligation will be affirmed. Therefore, the Policyholder's first issue will be sustained, reversing the judgment of the trial court and remanding for further proceedings on this particular point.

For the extra-contractual claims, the misrepresentation-based claims will be affirmed by the court since no evidence was presented to support them, focusing on the Insurer's failure to perform under the contract rather than false, misleading, or deceptive acts. However, the court will find that fact issues prevent summary judgment on the bad-faith claims. Since the Policyholder has presented evidence that may establish the Insurer had no reasonable basis to deny her mold damage claim, a potential fact issue is created as to the reasonableness of the Insurer's conduct. Similarly, with the additional DTPA claims, since none of the meritorious grounds in the Insurer's motion specifically attacked these claims, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment on these points as well.

In conclusion, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's dismissal of the misrepresentation-based claims but will reverse and remand the other claims for further proceedings."
"Evolv Health is a Dallas-based company that engages in multi-level marketing of health products and operates in Latin America through an indirect subsidiary, EvolvHealth Mexico. Easton Rutkoski, Kyle Palmer, Roberto Gonzalez, and Epic Era Incorporated (""Epic"") were involved in a series of events leading to their appeal. Rutkoski, Palmer, and others joined Evolv as employees or distributors in 2012, and negotiations for a joint venture led to the formation of EvolvHealth Mexico, with Rovzar and Roberto Gonzalez in leadership positions.

Tensions arose when Evolv's management suspected negative information dissemination by Steffe and Bott aimed at recruiting away top distributors. Additionally, the suspension of a major distributor, Barrios, led him to leave Evolv with his extensive downline.

Epic was formed, with Rutkoski, Palmer, and others transitioning from Evolv. Numerous distributors terminated their relationships with Evolv to establish business with Epic, and Evolv lost almost all of its Latin America distributors and revenue, precipitating several lawsuits.

Appellants contested a judgment based on a jury verdict finding liability and damages against them for tortious interference (Epic), breach of contract (Gonzalez), and breach of fiduciary duties (Gonzalez, Rutkoski, Palmer; Epic aiding and abetting). Appellants argued that Gonzalez was subject to a release contained in a Termination Agreement and challenged the sufficiency of evidence supporting each claim on which the judgment was based. Evolv contested a summary judgment in favor of Steffe and Bott, claiming they filed more than a scintilla of evidence in response to motions for summary judgment.","The court will affirm the judgment in part, based on sufficient evidence presented for breach of fiduciary duties and a contract wherein Gonzalez was indeed a party. Fiduciary breach was shown through defendants’ conduct, including failure to return or theft of inventory, resulting in a monetary loss to Evolv. It will suggest a remittitur for the damages award against Epic for tortious interference, given the lack of evidence directly connecting Epic's conduct to the calculated lost profits of Evolv. The suggested remittitur will modify the damages award specifically to reflect the loss associated with the unreturned inventory, not the loss of distributors. The judgment against Gonzalez for breach of contract will be based on evidence showing his involvement in the prevention of contractually obligated assets being returned, which satisfies the breach. Attorney fees awarded for breach of contract will be deemed appropriate since the non-compliance with segregation objections and contention on the incurrence of fees by EvolvHealth Mexico are not preserved for appellate review.

For the cross-appeal, the court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Steffe and Bott, due to insubstantial evidence from Evolv demonstrating that they agreed to be bound by the ESPP, which was foundational to the breach of contract claim.

If Evolv does not accept the remittitur, the tortious interference claim against Epic will be reversed and remanded for a new trial. All other aspects of the trial court's judgment will stand, with each party bearing its own costs."
"The appellant, a patient, sued the appellees, a hospital (Doctor's Hospital--Dallas) and a physician (Dr. Donald Dubrow), for medical malpractice. The patient was hospitalized for a bladder infection on February 19, 1991, and was treated by Dr. Dubrow, a licensed physician specializing in internal medicine with whom the appellant had a history of medical interaction. Both the hospital and Dr. Dubrow were aware that the appellant was allergic to penicillin. Despite this, Mefoxin—a drug contraindicated for penicillin-allergic patients—was prescribed by Dr. Dubrow and administered by the hospital. The appellant alleges this led to prolonged illness, additional medical issues, and a jeopardized life. Discharged on February 24, the appellant later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence and gross negligence against Dr. Dubrow and argued that any such acts were attributable to the hospital under respondeat superior.

In response to the lawsuit, both the hospital and Dr. Dubrow filed motions for summary judgment, asserting lack of negligence and absence of proximate causation of any injuries. Dr. Dubrow supported his motion with his own affidavit, while the hospital also relied on the same affidavit for their motion. The appellant countered with a response claiming the existence of material fact issues concerning Dr. Dubrow's breach of the standard of care and the hospital's liability due to Dr. Dubrow being a member of its staff. This response included affidavits from the appellant and Dr. Neal Stout. Before the summary judgment hearing, Dr. Dubrow requested to strike the appellant's response and attached evidence as untimely, which was granted by the trial court, thus leaving the appellant without any evidence to create a material fact issue regarding the standard of care or proximate causation.","The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees based on rule 166a(c) requirements and legal principles governing medical malpractice actions. The court will determine that Dr. Dubrow's affidavit met the criteria established in Duncan v. Horning, in which a defendant physician's affidavit could establish entitlement to summary judgment if it properly negates the elements of a malpractice claim—namely, that the physician complied with the standard of care and that no dereliction caused injury to the patient. Since Dr. Dubrow's affidavit adhered to these requirements, it successfully negated essential elements of the appellant's cause of action, particularly standard of care and proximate causation, thereby justifying summary judgment in his favor.

Regarding the appellant's response to the summary judgment, the court will find that the trial court was correct to strike it because it did not present any genuine issues of material fact, either because the evidence was stricken and thus not considered or, even if considered, it was insufficient. The appellant's own affidavit will be deemed inadequate to raise such issues because lay witness testimony on proximate cause is not considered probative in medical malpractice cases. Furthermore, Dr. Stout's affidavit will be found lacking any assertion of a causal connection between Dr. Dubrow's actions and the appellant's injuries. Without any established causal link, the claim against Dr. Dubrow fails, which in turn means that the hospital cannot be vicariously liable under respondeat superior.

The trial court's judgment will thus be affirmed since no factual issues were raised that could preclude summary judgment, and the evidentiary support for the appellant's claims was insufficient to meet the burden of proof required to survive a summary judgment motion."
"On February 9, 1984, 15-year-old Lisa L. Ramirez began experiencing severe abdominal pain. The following day, her parents took her to Valley Children's Center in Harlingen, Texas. Dr. William Grimes diagnosed her with gastroenteritis and sent her home with medication. However, Lisa's condition worsened, and she was taken back to the hospital at around 12:30 a.m. on February 11, where Dr. Grimes suspected appendicitis and contacted Dr. Thomas J. Klug, a general surgeon, around 1:00 a.m.

Dr. Klug decided to wait until Lisa was no longer dehydrated to perform surgery, which was eventually done at 10:45 a.m. The operation revealed a ruptured appendix and peritonitis. Lisa was discharged on February 18 but readmitted on February 22 due to suspected complications. Dr. Klug performed a second operation the next day, finding and draining an abdominal abscess. Lisa was discharged on March 2 and last seen by Dr. Klug on March 7, failing to show up for a follow-up on March 9.

The Ramirezes filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Klug, alleging negligence in diagnosis, medication administration, surgical treatment timing, and discharge from the hospital. Specifically, they contended Dr. Klug's premature discharge without appropriate tests caused Lisa ongoing menstrual pain, pelvic adhesions, and potential sterility. The jury found Dr. Klug negligent, and damages were awarded. Dr. Klug appealed, challenging the sufficiency of evidence on negligence and proximate cause.

The Ramirezes' medical expert, Dr. Martinez, testified to the standard of care, criticizing Dr. Klug's decision to discharge Lisa with persistent fever and infection without further evaluation. However, Dr. Martinez did not establish a direct causation between her discharge and the claimed damages of menstrual pain and potential sterility.","The appellate court decided that Dr. Klug's actions were not the proximate cause of Lisa's claimed damages. Although Dr. Martinez's testimony provided some evidence of negligence in the standard of care by discharging Lisa with a fever, there was no evidence demonstrating how this negligence directly led to Lisa's adhesions or scarring, or that further testing would likely have prevented her long-term complications.

Since proximate cause is a vital element in a medical malpractice case, requiring proof that the alleged negligence led directly and foreseeably to the injury, the absence of evidence connecting Dr. Klug's decision to the specific injuries Lisa experienced mandated granting an instructed verdict in his favor. Consequently, the appellate court overturned the trial court's ruling against Dr. Klug, sustaining his third point of error regarding insufficient evidence of proximate cause and overruling the second point on negligence. The case concludes with the court rendering judgment that the Ramirezes take nothing in their malpractice action against Dr. Klug, due to the failure to prove the proximate cause aspect of their claims."
"On August 7, 1993, Lee Jones, a mentally-ill individual, entered the Howard Johnson Hotel located in Sharpstown, Texas at around 2:00 p.m., after being released from a mental facility. Lee obtained quarters from the desk clerk and made multiple phone calls to his brother, Carver Jones, throughout the afternoon and evening. Carver Jones spoke to a hospital which agreed to admit Lee to the psychiatric unit.

At about 9:30 p.m., Lee had a conversation with Security Officer Pringle and asked for a cigarette, then went to the restroom, and upon his return asked for another cigarette. At this point, Carver arrived at the hotel and a heated argument ensued between the brothers. Carver left to use the telephone. During this time, Lee asked Pringle if he could handle his gun, to which Pringle said no and turned to leave. Lee then managed to take the gun from Pringle's holster, and Carver, upon returning from the phone, ran back to call 911 after hearing a gunshot. He discovered his brother had shot himself.

Carver Jones sued various parties associated with the hotel and security service, including the hotel, the hotel manager, the security firm, and the security officer for negligence and gross negligence claiming they (1) gave a weapon or allowed the decedent to acquire the weapon; (2) negligently hired an improperly trained security guard; and (3) failed to guard against and warn of an unreasonably dangerous condition. The defense moved for summary judgment claiming no duty to prevent the decedent's suicide to either Carver Jones or Lee Jones, and that Lee's suicide was the sole proximate cause of Carver's damages.","The court will affirm the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the defendants: hotel, hotel manager, security firm, and security officer. The justification for this decision will include that no duty of care was owed by any of the defendants to prevent the decedent, Lee Jones', suicide. The court will reason that such a duty was not established either by the principles of general negligence or under premises liability laws.

In assessing the duty of care, the court will consider several factors, such as risk and foreseeability of injury, weighed against factors such as the social utility of the actor's conduct, the magnitude and consequences of guarding against injury. With these principles in mind, the court will find no special or enhanced duty of care that was violated by the defendants, particularly with respect to securing the firearm from a non-threatening individual. The court will observe that the unpredictable act of suicide by a third party is generally considered an intervening act that absolves the defendants of negligence in this context unless the act was foreseeable due to a special relationship, such as that between a psychiatrist and patient, which does not exist in this case.

Further, the court will cite the absence of evidence to suggest the security guard or the hotel staff knew or should have known about Lee Jones' potential danger to himself (foreseeability) or that any negligent conduct leading up to the incident was sufficiently linked to the injury (proximate cause). The court will also highlight that Carver Jones had more of an awareness of the decedent's mental health condition than the defendants, undermining the claim that the hotel or its security personnel should have anticipated or prevented the suicide.

Accordingly, since none of the defendants owed a particularly high duty of care towards Lee Jones or Carver Jones under the circumstances presented, and Lee's actions were of his own volition and an independent intervening act, the court will determine that the defendants are not liable for Lee's suicide, and there are no material fact issues that preclude the granting of summary judgment."
"On April 22, 1994, Robin Lee was sexually assaulted by an HIV-positive patient while she was under the care of Wichita Falls State Hospital for a mental disorder that rendered her hypersexual and promiscuous. Subsequent to the assault, Lee filed suit against the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (MHMR), the State of Texas, the hospital, and Don Gilbert, the Commissioner of MHMR. 

Lee's suit alleged a cause of action under section 101.021(2) of the Texas Tort Claims Act, arguing that her injuries were proximately caused by the hospital's failure to lock the doors to her room and to provide locks on the doors between the men's and women's wings of the facility. She claimed these failures constituted both a misuse of tangible property and a defective condition. Additionally, Lee alleged a cause of action under section 321.002 of the Texas Health and Safety Code for violations of the ""patient's bill of rights,"" specifically citing her right to ""freedom from mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and exploitation.""

The appellants filed a plea to the jurisdiction grounded in sovereign immunity, claiming Lee’s suit should be dismissed as the State had not waived immunity for the claims presented. The plea argued that Lee had not sufficiently alleged a cause of action under the Texas Tort Claims Act as the unlocked hospital doors did not proximately cause her injury, but merely furnished a condition that made the assault possible. Furthermore, they contested that the Texas Legislature had not waived the State's immunity from suit for violations of the patient's bill of rights.

The trial court denied the plea, holding that it ""lacks merit."" The appellants contended that the trial court's jurisdictional decision was incorrect, given Lee's suit was barred by the sovereign immunity doctrine.","The judgment will likely be reversed and appellee Lee’s causes of action dismissed due to jurisdictional bars stemming from sovereign immunity. 

It will be reasoned that Robin Lee has not adequately alleged a cause of action under the Tort Claims Act. Although Lee claims the hospital's failure to lock the doors constituted a misuse of tangible property, proximate cause by law demands a close causal relationship between the property's condition or use and the resulting injury. Herein, the unlocked doors permitted the assailant access but did not proximately cause the assault. The hinges of Lee's complaints rest on the failure of hospital staff to protect her, which falls outside the limited waiver of immunity conferred by the Tort Claims Act.

Additionally, it will be predicted that the legislature did not express a clear and unambiguous intent to waive sovereign immunity for patient's bill of rights claims. The relevant statutes defining ""treatment facility"" and ""mental health facility,"" when incorporated, do not manifest intent to waive immunity by authorizing actions against governmental entities. Furthermore, the legislative history indicates the statute targeted abuse in private, not public, mental health facilities. Therefore, Lee has not stated an actionable claim under the Health and Safety Code that waves sovereign immunity from suit.

In conclusion, due to jurisdictional bars set by sovereign immunity, Lee's actions will be seen as dismissed, as her allegations do not fall within the statutory provisions that would waive such immunity for the State or its entities."
"On July 22, 2016, Anthony Henegar, his daughter Mason, his friends Dan Mohorc and Larry Scala, along with their daughters, embarked on a nighttime boating excursion on Cedar Creek Lake in Texas. The boat was a 2010 pleasure boat owned by Anthony, and they left from the Henegars' lakehouse around 11 p.m.

During the trip, the teenage girls were allowed to drive the boat. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Sierra, Larry's fifteen-year-old daughter, was driving the boat when they became lost, entered a cove, and approached a bridge for Texas Highway 198. Larry took control but misjudged the height of the bridge and collided with it while attempting to pass underneath. The crash resulted in serious injuries to Anthony, who suffered a traumatic brain injury, and the death of Dan Mohorc.

After the collision, Mason attempted to direct Larry back to their lakehouse but was unsuccessful. Larry then docked the boat at the nearest available location, where a good Samaritan assisted them and called emergency services. Responding agencies included Caney City Police Department, the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, and Texas Parks and Wildlife. Larry was arrested for intoxication manslaughter, but the charges were later dropped.

The Henegars (Anthony and his family) sued several defendants: the boat manufacturer (Regal Marine Industries, Inc.), the boat seller (Singleton Assets & Operations, LLC, d/b/a Phil Dill Boats), the compass part manufacturer (Rule Industries, LLC), and the producer and installer of the lighted tower speakers and underwater lights on the boat (Earmark, Inc.). The suit included claims under strict products liability, negligence, gross negligence, fraud, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Mason Henegar brought forward a claim for loss of consortium and bystander injury, and Drue Henegar, Anthony and Lori's other daughter, also brought a loss of consortium claim.

It was undisputed that Larry, Anthony, and Dan had consumed alcohol that evening before setting out and that they had taken alcohol aboard. Witnesses, including boat passengers, did not testify to having the boat's interior cockpit lights, navigation lights, speaker tower lights, or any other component lighting on at the time of the collision, nor did they attribute any lighting to their difficulties in visibility while operating the boat.

The Henegars enlisted three expert witnesses to support their case: an expert in human visual perception and accident reconstruction, an electrical engineer specialized in accident reconstruction and human factors, and an expert in industrial/organization psychology and risk analysis. These experts testified that the boat's lighting features and windshield, as well as occupants seated at the front, interfered with Larry's visibility and ability to judge the bridge's height, thus contributing to the collision. They claimed these combined factors were the producing cause of the accident.

All defendants filed motions for traditional and/or no-evidence summary judgment, asserting that the Henegars failed to substantiate a genuine issue of material fact regarding causation. The trial court granted the summary judgment motions in favor of the defendants, leading to the dismissal of all of the Henegars' claims, and the Henegars subsequently appealed.","In this appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for all defendants, deeming there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the causation element of the Henegars' claims. The court's reasoning hinges heavily upon the testimonies provided, particularly the lack of evidence showing the boat's cockpit and speaker lights were on at the time of the collision.

Predicting the verdict reasoning, it is likely to focus on the quality of evidence the Henegars presented regarding the causation of the collision. The court will scrutinize whether the expert testimony effectively linked the alleged defects and negligence of the defendants to the accident's causation. It will consider whether the cockpit and tower lights were indeed on at the time of the collision and if they substantially contributed to the incident.

Despite affidavits and simulations provided by the experts, the verdict will take into account direct testimonies from those present at the time of the crash, none of whom recalled any lights being on that might impede visibility. The reasoning may also underscore inconsistencies and lack of memories related to crucial details, such as which lights, if any, were activated during the collision, due to the darkness mentioned and alcohol consumption.

Furthermore, the court will likely reason that since no evidence or testimony directly attributed the boat's lighting features or other components as a contributing factor to the collision, and because of the inconsistent memory recollections among witnesses, this lack of specific facts fails to create more than a mere suspicion or surmise regarding causation. The court will draw attention to the fact that the experts' opinions aggregated the various potential hazards rather than isolating the lighting as a crucial factor in the accident, diminishing the strength of the causation argument.

The court will conclude that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of each defendant on all of the Henegars' primary claims due to a failure to establish causation. Thus, the verdict will uphold the dismissal of additional claims related to loss of consortium and gross negligence, as these are derivative and contingent on establishing the primary claim of negligence or product liability."
"The patient, Venice E. Hart, filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. I. L. Van Zandt, alleging that the doctor's actions and inactions in both the surgical operation performed on his lower back and the subsequent post-operative care constituted actionable negligence leading to permanent physical injuries. In particular, the patient suffered sensory losses to his leg and foot and malfunction of his elimination organs.

The core of the dispute lies within the surgery and post-operative treatment period beginning in 1951 when Mr. Hart first became Dr. Van Zandt's patient due to a ruptured disc at the L5 S1 level of the spine. He received conservative treatment until 1959, when a new severe pain in his lower back led him back to Dr. Van Zandt, who, after some conservative treatments, recommended surgery.

On October 13, Dr. Van Zandt operated, but instead of inspecting or treating the L5 S1 level as pre-operatively planned, he performed surgery at the L4 L5 level, without visualizing the L5 S1 disc. Post-operatively, Mr. Hart developed new symptoms, including an inability to empty his bladder and a lack of sensation in various body parts. Despite these new symptoms, Dr. Van Zandt did not recommend additional surgery. Instead, he referred Mr. Hart to specialists who identified nerve root trauma but operated under the false belief that the L5 S1 disc had been treated.

Eventually, Mr. Hart sought treatment from Dr. Frederick C. Rehfeldt, who found nerve roots compressed at both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 levels, the latter also suffering from a ruptured disc compressing the dura sac, requiring surgery for decompression. Post-Rehfeldt's surgery, Mr. Hart reported an unchanged condition since Dr. Van Zandt's operation.

The trial court granted the doctor's motion for a peremptory instruction and ruled that the patient takes nothing, which the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. On appeal to a higher court, the determination focused on whether there was evidence to support a jury finding that Dr. Van Zandt's actions were negligent and that such negligence was a proximate cause of Mr. Hart's injuries. Expert testimony indicated that in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a doctor in the exercise of ordinary care and skill would have explored both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 interspaces during an operation and that a myelogram and surgery should have followed the operation in response to Mr. Hart's symptoms. Testimony also revealed that delayed surgery after the initial operation could result in permanent damage, as seemed to occur with Mr. Hart.","Given the detailed background and the legal principles that apply to medical malpractice cases, the verdict will consider the testimonies of medical professionals about the actions expected of Dr. Van Zandt under the circumstances, particularly the expectation of exploring both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 levels during surgery. The presence of Mr. Hart's symptoms post-operation, which included lack of bladder control, sensory losses, and pain consistent with nerve compression, will imply that Dr. Van Zandt's decision not to explore or treat the L5 S1 level, although initially part of the surgical plan, appears to constitute a departure from the standard of care practiced in the local medical community. 

The fact that Mr. Hart's condition did not improve following Dr. Van Zandt's surgery strongly suggests that the initial surgical assessment and the choice of operative level (L4 L5 instead of L5 S1) directly correlated with the poor outcome and persistent symptoms, making the negligence claim credible. Additionally, the failure to pursue further diagnostic tests or operations in light of Mr. Hart's ongoing symptoms might be seen as a compounding factor of the alleged negligence and another deviation from the standards of care, contributing to the irreversible damage.

The expert witnesses' agreement that delayed surgery could result in permanent nerve damage will be taken into account, with the inference likely being that the delayed second surgery was a result of the doctor's negligence and directly linked to the injury's permanence. Given that Mr. Hart sought and obtained a different treatment consistent with initial expectations from Dr. Van Zandt, this further suggests a breach of the standard of care on the latter's part.

The testimony from other medical professionals as to the appropriate course of action in similar circumstances, based on the standard protocols and practices within the relevant medical community, will likely be deemed admissible and persuasive. Moreover, due to the technical nature of the case, involving specialized knowledge of spinal operations and nerve damage, the court will place significant weight on the testimony from qualified experts.

Therefore, the original judgments that the patient takes nothing will likely be reversed because substantial issues of fact exist regarding negligence and causation that should be considered by a jury. The higher court might find that granting the peremptory instruction was in error, and a new trial will be necessary to resolve these factual disputes. The testimony of a doctor from the same school of practice, indicating that the operative choices made by Dr. Van Zandt, or lack thereof, fell below the standard of care, will likely play a crucial role in this determination, supporting a verdict that will favor the patient by allowing the case to proceed to trial where a jury can decide on the matters presented."
"The case involves a wrongful death suit brought by the mother of three minors, who acted as next friend, against the Dallas Railway & Terminal Company (""the railway"" or ""appellant""). The lawsuit was filed due to the death of the minors' father, A. H. Archer, resulting from electric shock. On January 8, 1939, Mr. Archer walked into an uninsulated telephone wire that was blown from the defendant's poles by a violent windstorm, striking the company's trolley wire before extending over a street and sidewalk onto a vacant lot. The railway had previously leased the tracks, poles, and trolley wires from the lessor, Northern Texas Traction Company, which retained the telephone wire atop the poles for its exclusive use and assumed its maintenance.

During the incident, the company's poles, tracks, and a trolley wire were in place, marking only the condition that made the injury possible. The jury found that the employees and the company through its employees were guilty of various forms of negligence after the storm—such as failing to warn Mr. Archer of the charged wire, failing to correct the dangerous condition after its discovery or within a reasonable time after they should have discovered it, failing to place barricades, failing to shut off the power to the wire, and failing to remove the charged wire from the sidewalk. The only company employee present at the occurrence, Mr. Middlebrook, who was a street car operator, immediately reported the downed wire upon noticing it but did not have the technical knowledge or equipment to handle the situation and was advised by firemen to move his streetcar, which he did shortly before Mr. Archer walked into the wire.","The reasoning for the predicted verdict in favor of the railway will likely be based on several key points. First, it will be noted that the proximate cause of Mr. Archer's death was the windstorm itself and not the equipment maintained by the railway, with the railway's property only providing the condition that allowed for the injury to happen. Specifically, it will be argued that without the windstorm, no danger would have existed from the defendant's poles or trolley wires.

Second, it will be maintained that the railway was entitled to a reasonable time to ameliorate or correct the dangerous condition, and that the incident taking place approximately twenty minutes after the storm did not provide sufficient time to do so, especially given the complexities involved in cutting off power to the trolley wire, which could have caused even greater harm.

Third, it will be asserted that the sole employee of the company at the scene, Mr. Middlebrook, fulfilled his duty by reporting the hazardous condition and was neither equipped nor required to repair the wire or personally warn pedestrians. It will also be noted that firemen, who arrived on the scene and took charge, instructed him to move the streetcar to prevent congestion, which he complied with just before Mr. Archer's fatal contact with the wire.

Lastly, the verdict will emphasize the argument that the acts of Mr. Middlebrook, the only direct link between the company and the incident, did not constitute negligence that was the proximate cause of Mr. Archer’s death. As such, it will be concluded that no actionable negligence on the part of the defendant or any of its agents has been demonstrated, and therefore, the railway's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted by the trial court. Consequently, the appellate court will reverse the trial court’s judgment and render a verdict in favor of the railway."
"This is a products liability case where appellant patients sued appellees E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor), and Louisiana State University (LSU) for injuries allegedly caused by temporomandibular (jaw) joint (TMJ) implants.

E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company (DuPont) sold polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) under the Teflon trademark to Vitek, which used these materials to manufacture medical devices, including the TMJ implant in question. Prior to selling PTFE to Vitek, DuPont issued a disclaimer stating they did not manufacture Teflon for medical purposes, had not conducted detailed long-term studies for such use, and that the company would not be responsible for consequences resulting from medical use.

Dr. Charles Homsy, a former DuPont employee and the founder of Vitek, began purchasing PTFE from DuPont and developed Proplast, a porous implant material encouraging tissue ingrowth. Despite DuPont's medical use disclaimer, Homsy's invention led to a variety of medical device applications, including the disputed TMJ implants. The FDA authorized the sale of the Proplast TMJ Interpositional Implant.

Appellants brought action against DuPont under theories of strict liability, negligence, and ""concert of action,"" alleging DuPont was aware of the medical use of their products and failed to warn accordingly. They sued Baylor for negligence related to hiring and supervising Dr. Homsy and for failing to warn of the dangers of the TMJ implant developed by Homsy. Lastly, they sued LSU for negligence, claiming liability because LSU's employee, Dr. Kent, helped design the TMJ implant.","The court affirmed the summary judgments in favor of DuPont and Baylor and affirmed the plea to the jurisdiction granted in favor of LSU.

For DuPont, the court predicted there was no strict liability for supplying PTFE and FEP because DuPont did not provide defective or inherently dangerous products. It just supplied a raw material to Vitek, a manufacturer with independent duty to warn. The court would also note that no evidence showed employing the doctor who designed the implant by Baylor proximately caused appellants' injuries.

There was no basis for strict liability on the part of DuPont because the PTFE and FEP supplied were not defectively manufactured, and DuPont sold these according to Vitek's specifications. There was no evidence of defective PTFE or FEP used in the appellants' implants. Moreover, the injuries resulted from the design of the implant and its location, rather than the properties of PTFE.

DuPont did not owe a duty to warn because Vitek was capable of passing on necessary warnings to consumers, and no evidence showed DuPont was involved in the design or marketing of the implants. Also, DuPont's HS-10 process’s similarities with Vitek's process for making Proplast did not contribute to foreseeing the specific failure of the implant. Furthermore, the fact that Homsy or Vitek misrepresented their products as ""medical grade"" Teflon did not make DuPont a knowing collaborator.

For Baylor, the court found no evidence that Baylor was negligent in hiring or supervising Homsy nor did it show Baylor had a duty to warn of the dangers. It did not have any control over the design, development, or marketing of the TMJ implant or Proplast. Baylor's institutional review board did not review protocols for the TMJ implant, and Baylor itself did not conduct any research, development, designing, or testing related to the TMJ implant.

In regards to LSU, the court would apply the principle of comity in deference to Louisiana state law, which prescribes that suits against the state or any state agency should not be instituted in any court other than a Louisiana state court. The Louisiana venue statute does not offend any Texas public policy; therefore, LSU would be granted a plea to the jurisdiction.

Based on these findings, the court would conclude that appellants' injuries were due to the design and application of the TMJ implants rather than any failure by DuPont or Baylor. LSU's distinct jurisdictional status would further remove it from liability in the Texas court."
"In 1996, Jerry Hamblin and Thomas Lamont formed Ricochet Energy, Inc., an oil and gas company, with Hamblin serving as president and Lamont as chief operating officer. Ricochet had agreements with Vaquillas Energy Lopeno Ltd. and JOB Energy Partners II to identify Texas oil and gas prospects, create seismic maps, and present these opportunities with a first right of refusal for exploration. These deals granted Vaquillas and JOB a proprietary interest in data and interpretations of accepted prospects. Chris Maier, Ricochet's geologist, discovered the lucrative Lopeno Prospect in 2004, and the involved parties protected the seismic data as confidential.

In 2006, Lamont decided to separate from Ricochet, and during the separation process, he maintained access to company data and offices. In 2007, agreements assigned various Ricochet prospects to Lamont and granted him the right to participate as a working-interest owner. He was privy to valuable information about the Lopeno Prospect, including its estimated value and the optimal location for drilling on adjacent property. Lamont used his knowledge of the Lopeno Prospect's value to attract investors like Rosendo Carranco, eventually sharing the seismic map and selling a portion of his interest in the prospect.

Lamont and Carranco collaborated to lease the El Milagro property, which was crucial for accessing the gas reservoir identified by Ricochet's seismic map. They did so secretly through a company named Montecristo Energy II, formed shortly before finalizing the lease. Using the treasure map and other confidential data to guide them, Carranco and Lamont's new company drilled wells that quickly depleted the Lopeno Prospect gas reservoir, thwarting Ricochet's ability to profit from it. 

Vaquillas and JOB sued Lamont, Carranco, and their respective companies for misappropriating trade secrets, tortious interference, and conspiracy. The jury found the defendants misappropriated the Lopeno Prospect Treasure Map, intentionally interfered with the PGAs, and conspired to do these actions.","The seismic map of the Lopeno Prospect was validated as a trade secret because Ricochet Energy, Inc. had taken appropriate measures to maintain its confidentiality. Lamont, despite his resignation, did not possess the authority to negate the map's trade secret status. Showing the map to potential investors did not destroy its protected status, and actions by Lamont and Carranco, including the misuse of the map to acquire the El Milagro lease and drill wells, confirmed the trade secret's value.

Lamont and Carranco's deception in using the map, and the motivation for leasing the property being the seismic information and not other documents, constituted improper usage. Neither had authorization from Ricochet to utilize the trade secret for competitive drilling on the El Milagro property. Their conduct violated commonly accepted commercial and ethical standards.

Evidence supported the jury's findings that Lamont and Carranco knowingly interfered with the PGAs by using the trade secret to compete against Ricochet in the Lopeno Prospect, thus diminishing the value of the agreements and the seismic map for Vaquillas and JOB. The jury's determination that Lamont did not have a good-faith privilege to interfere with the contracts based on his status as a working-interest owner in the Lopeno Prospect was upheld due to the misappropriation and use of the map being below acceptable standards and without Ricochet's consent.

The legal sufficiency of the jury's findings that the defendants conspired to harm the plaintiffs was upheld since the formation of Montecristo II and L.O.G., as well as the undisclosed meetings and actions against Ricochet's interests, pointed to a collusion to use the trade secret and interfere with the PGAs to their advantage.

The trial court's definition of ""proximate cause"" in the jury instruction was not deemed error, and the evidence supported the reasonable certainty required for the jury to award lost profits damages to the plaintiffs. The calculated amount was based on objective data related to actual gas production, market value, and geological data. Hence, the jury appropriately quantified lost profits caused by the defendants' interference and misappropriation of the trade secret.

"The case involves a plaintiff employee who suffered personal injuries while cleaning oil that had been negligently sprayed on his employer's equipment. The plaintiff was cleaning the equipment with gasoline when a fire ignited, causing him severe burns. The trial court conducted a jury trial, which resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The employer appealed the decision, raising several objections:

1. Insufficient evidence to support the application of the ""rescue doctrine"" relied on by the plaintiff;
2. The claim that the plaintiff voluntarily encountered a known risk;
3. Allegations that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law;
4. The argument that the plaintiff's conduct was a new and intervening cause;
5. The contention that the employer's conduct was not a proximate cause as a matter of law.

The plaintiff was a production superintendent for an oil company and was responsible for various equipment pieces, which the jury found were negligently sprayed by the defendant with slick and flammable crude oil. This created a dangerous condition in terms of both slickness and a fire hazard.

There was evidence that approximately five barrels of oil were left on the property, covering an area of 30 feet by 15 feet and sprayed on various pieces of critical equipment. Witnesses frequented the properties, some on a daily basis. The plaintiff discussed the cleanup with the defendant’s employee soon after the oil was spread but did not agree on any action, and conditions the following day were not conducive to cleaning. When the defendant didn't clean up the oil by the third day, the plaintiff started the cleaning himself using white gasoline, a method considered standard in the oil field for its effectiveness.

During the cleaning process, after hours of work with the gasoline, the plaintiff suddenly caught fire and sustained severe burns. The actual cause of ignition was not clear. One suggested possibility was a spark from a ring on the plaintiff’s finger or the gasoline can.

Based on the facts, the jury found that the defendant's negligent act, the spraying of oil, proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries. Additionally, the jury found that the plaintiff did not act with negligence in cleaning with gasoline and did not voluntarily expose himself to the known dangers of using gasoline.","The appellate court will affirm the decision of the trial court by analyzing the key issues identified during the appeal.

Regarding the ""rescue doctrine,"" the court will resolve that it was not necessary to assess its applicability solely to the protection of property, as the evidence also supported a finding of a genuine threat to personal safety—as strong as the threat to property. This determination will be based on the jury's findings regarding the hazardous condition created by the employer.

On the issue of whether the plaintiff voluntarily encountered a known risk, the court will hold that the plaintiff's acknowledgment of the dangers of using gasoline was similar to everyday risks taken by reasonable people, such as refueling a car.

The court may further clarify that knowing the dangers does not equate to voluntarily encountering them in a legal sense. The plaintiff's actions in taking precautions—such as checking for coolness and cutting off all nearby flames—demonstrate an attempt to alleviate the threat without being reckless. The significance of this will be that the court acknowledges the concept of ""free volition"" and ""intelligent choice,"" thereby upholding the jury's finding that the plaintiff did not voluntarily expose himself to the danger.

The appellate court will reject the employer's contention that the plaintiff's decision was not based on urgency or imminent danger. They will assert that this factor is not decisive in determining whether the plaintiff's actions were justified under the circumstances. Instead, the court will place emphasis on whether the plaintiff's reaction to the situation was that of an ordinarily prudent person acting to alleviate a genuine threat.

Finally, the court will hold that the issue of whether the plaintiff's methods and efforts to avert the danger created by the employer were reasonable was a question rightly posed to the jury. It will be determined that the jury's conclusion—that the plaintiff's actions were not negligent and did not constitute a new, independent, and intervening cause—was correct.

In conclusion, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's verdict, stating that the jury appropriately evaluated the evidence and plaintiff's actions. There was no reversible error in their determination, and the jury's findings regarding negligence and contributory negligence were supported by the evidence. The court will not accept that any of the points raised by the appellant (employer) merit a different outcome."
"Louis Davis and Helen Davis, a husband and wife, were involved in an automobile collision with a pickup pulling a homemade trailer driven by Larry Strahan, Jr., an employee of Diversified Oil Field Service International, Inc. (Diversified). The pickup slowed to turn left; Mr. Davis stopped his vehicle, but was subsequently rear-ended by Melody Graham, who claimed another vehicle had hit her causing her to strike the Davises. The identity of the third driver was unknown. The Davises sued Diversified, Strahan, and Graham for injuries and damages, and also their insurer, Texas Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau), claiming underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage. Graham also filed a cross-action against Strahan and Diversified, blaming the collision solely on Strahan.

The jury found Strahan's negligence proximately caused the incident and that he was grossly negligent. Mrs. Davis was awarded $240,003.47, including $87,000 for future medical expenses. Mr. Davis was awarded $10,000, with $5,000 for past and $5,000 for future pain and mental anguish. Further, the jury assessed $500,000 in exemplary damages against Strahan. Graham's and the unknown driver's negligence were not found to be the proximate cause. The court awarded judgment against Strahan and Diversified for all damages, including exemplary damages and pre-judgment interest, and ruled the Davises recover nothing from Graham and Farm Bureau.","The appellate court will affirm the judgment against appellants, Strahan and Diversified, in most aspects except the award of future pain and suffering to Mr. Davis due to insufficient evidence supporting that claim. The court will find the evidence legally sufficient to support the jury's awards regarding the proximate cause of the collision, Mrs. Davis's future medical expenses, her lost earning capacity, and the finding of gross negligence. The court will acknowledge Strahan pulling a trailer without proper lighting created an extreme risk, satisfying the objective component of gross negligence, and his awareness of the danger met the subjective component. However, the court will find no evidence of future physical pain and mental anguish for Mr. Davis and will reform the judgment to exclude the awarded $5,000 for future pain and mental anguish due to this lack of evidence.

As for the other objections raised, such as improper jury argument and whether exemplary damages against Diversified are proper without specific findings, these will be overruled. The appellate court will note that any mention of insurance during the trial was not specific enough to constitute reversible error, and any error in the jury argument was curable and was, in fact, addressed by the court during the trial.

Regarding the argument that the exemplary damages award violates due process, the court will also overrule this objection, citing a recent case, City of La Porte v. Prince, as precedent to affirm the award. The verdict will hold Strahan and Diversified jointly and severally liable for the adjusted awards and affirm the judgment as reformed."
"The appellants, Jodell and Thomas Stansel, appealed a ""take-nothing"" verdict from the jury in favor of the appellee, Dr. Bahjat Rahman, regarding an allegedly unnecessary hysterectomy procedure. The Stansels accused Dr. Rahman of negligence, medical malpractice, fraud, and lack of informed consent.

Ms. Stansel initially consulted Dr. Rahman for symptoms including abdominal cramping and dysmenorrhea, and a previous diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and had been advised by another physician to consider hysterectomy. Dr. Rahman recommended diagnostic procedures with the possibility of laparotomy and suggested preparing for a hysterectomy, to be decided during surgery while Ms. Stansel was under anesthesia.

Before the operation at Sam Houston Memorial Hospital, Dr. Rahman ordered that consent forms be signed for various procedures, but the section for abdominal hysterectomy was omitted due to an incomplete form. Nonetheless, Dr. Rahman maintained that he discussed the risks of hysterectomy with Ms. Stansel, as evidenced in his admission note.

During surgery, Dr. Rahman performed a total abdominal hysterectomy and removed the fallopian tubes based on findings consistent with chronic PID. He also removed the appendix, which was covered in lesions, though this was not discussed with Ms. Stansel nor consented to.

Post-surgery, Ms. Stansel experienced severe pelvic pain, and despite consulting with about 35 physicians, no medical reason connecting the pain to Dr. Rahman's surgery was established.

At the trial, the court used broad-form questions for the jury, which returned unanimous ""No"" verdicts regarding allegations of medical negligence, fraud, and lack of informed consent by Dr. Rahman.","In predicting the rationale for the court's affirmation of the jury's verdict, the trial court's use of broad-form questions, as opposed to appellants' proposed granulated issues, will likely be considered proper and in accordance with Rule 277 and applicable case law, which mandate the use of broad-form questions where feasible, barring extraordinary circumstances.

The court will likely find that the appellants' claims, including misrepresentation of medical condition and alleged informed consent failures, are encompassed by negligence and malpractice under the Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (MLIIA). MLIIA defines all liability theories in the healthcare realm as negligence-based on meeting accepted medical standards, thus merger of misrepresentation into the broad-form negligence question is correct.

Without admissible expert testimony showing that specific undisclosed risks from the procedures caused harm to Ms. Stansel, the claims of informed consent violations for procedures other than hysterectomy will fail. Only claims of unauthorized additional procedures, in which expert testimony supports a connection between undisclosed risks and the patient's injuries, should be submitted for jury consideration.

The court will likely conclude that Dr. Rahman's rebuttal to the presumption of negligence in the informed consent issue was effective since he provided evidence, including testimonies and medical records, showing the discussion of risks with Ms. Stansel despite the incomplete consent form.

Overall, for the legal and factual sufficiency challenges to succeed, the appellants must show that there is no evidence supporting the jury's findings or that the jury's decision was against the great weight of the evidence. Based on the evidence presented, including the testimony of medical experts and records corroborating Dr. Rahman's version of events, the court will determine the jury's verdict to be reasonable. Therefore, the trial court's ruling will be affirmed as there was no abuse of discretion, and judgments made align with established legal principles and evidence."
"The appellant in this case is an electric company, while the appellee is a landowner. On May 24, 1931, a high tension wire belonging to the electric company broke and fell on the landowner's property, igniting a fire. The landowner, a widow who managed her farm, attempted to extinguish the fire and, in doing so, received several electric shocks, causing personal injury. She was unfamiliar with electricity and its hazards. Her fences, which were composed of wire, became electrified due to being connected with the fallen power line.

The landowner filed a personal injury lawsuit against the electric company, alleging negligence. The jury found in her favor, concluding that the electric company had not taken proper precautions, such as grounding the wires of the fence under its power line and failing to maintain a circuit breaker that would cut off the current when the transmission line broke. The case hinged on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows a negligence claim to be made based on the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents. The appellant electric company argued that the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor and challenged the jury instructions regarding grounding the fences and the adjustment of the circuit breaker.

The jury found that the electric company's failure to have a properly adjusted circuit breaker and the lack of sufficient grounding constituted negligence and were proximate causes of the injuries. Furthermore, the jury determined that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, despite the company's argument that she should have known the danger after receiving shocks.","The court is expected to affirm the judgment of the trial court. The reason for this is that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, given that electricity is a force that requires a high standard of care and the types of accidents that occurred in this case generally do not happen absent negligence on part of the entity controlling it. Moreover, the evidence provided demonstrated that the electric company did not act with due care.

The burden of proof shifted to the electric company to demonstrate due care, but they failed to do so, evidenced by their lack of a properly functioning circuit breaker. Additionally, the mere fact that the electric current was discharged from a fallen wire and the landowner suffered injuries makes a prima facie case of negligence. The court will observe that the electric company did not ground the fence sufficiently and set the circuit breaker too high at 80 amperes despite knowing that a lower setting might have prevented the injury. 

Furthermore, the jury's assessment will likely be considered reasonable and not subject to disturbance by the higher court. These findings indicate the company’s negligence in protecting the public. The electric company's defenses about the landowner's contributory negligence are not sustainable because she lacked knowledge of the danger, and her actions were in response to an emergency. Additionally, the potential juror misconduct discussed by the appellant will likely be considered irrelevant as it transpired after the verdict was already established. Hence, the appeals court is expected to uphold the original judgment in favor of the appellee (the landowner)."
"Perla Montes, who suffered from end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, had an arteriovenous graft placed in her left forearm by a vascular surgeon. The graft became clotted, necessitating intervention for dialysis. Dr. Heramb K. Singh, an interventional radiologist, performed a declotting procedure using a ""trellis"" device and angioplasty on December 19, 2009. Complications arose, leading to the amputation of Montes's left hand and forearm on December 23, 2009. Montes sued Singh for medical negligence in 2011 and passed away on December 3, 2012, with her daughter, Kendra Payan, continuing the lawsuit as the representative of Montes's estate.

Singh enlisted Drs. Carl Blond and Michael Wholey as expert witnesses. Prior to trial, Payan motioned to exclude Dr. Wholey's testimony on proximate cause, and the court allowed him to testify only on the standard of care. Singh also faced exclusion by the trial court of a portion of his testimony and Dr. Blond's testimony, which intended to address past successful outcomes and post-amputation conditions of Montes.

The trial court sustained objections to Singh's questions about his experience with the trellis procedure and the number of successful outcomes in similar patients, due to relevance concerns and the absence of a sufficiently similar comparative basis. Singh argued that the exclusion prevented him from demonstrating to the jury the basis of his belief that the trellis procedure would be successful for Montes. No proffer of evidence showing similar patients or success rates was made.

Dr. Wholey's testimony on proximate cause was excluded as he admitted having no basis for his opinion that Singh's actions did not cause Montes's injuries and damages. Singh contended on appeal that Blond's testimony was wrongfully limited, and he was harmed by the disallowance of explanation of Montes's condition post-amputation. No offer of proof was made outlining what Dr. Blond's testimony would entail.

The jury's verdict favored Payan, awarding damages for pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, and physical impairment. Singh appealed the judgment.","The judgment will be affirmed as the exclusions and limitations of testimony by Singh, Dr. Blond, and Dr. Wholey do not constitute an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Despite Singh's contention that the exclusions limited his ability to present a full defense, the appellate court will determine that such evidence was either not sufficiently preserved for review or was cumulative and not controlling on a material issue.

As for Singh's testimony regarding his past trellis procedures, his answer about never having another amputation was cumulative of his and his experts' testimonies that he was experienced and followed proper care standards. Moreover, since Singh did not proffer evidence about the number of times he had performed the trellis procedure with a positive result on similar patients, the appellate court will find this complaint unpreserved.

Regarding Dr. Blond's testimony, Singh failed to make an offer of proof specific enough to show the nature of the excluded evidence, failing to preserve the complaint on appeal. The exhibits admitted at trial were insufficient to summarize the excluded evidence that Singh argued was relevant.

As it concerns Dr. Wholey's testimony, the record reflects that Dr. Wholey had no basis for his opinion on causation, and Singh did not prove the proposed testimony was based on sound reasoning, methodology, and non-speculative data. Therefore, the appellate court will conclude that the exclusion of Dr. Wholey's testimony was not an abuse of discretion.

Lastly, the inclusion of the eggshell plaintiff instruction in the jury charge did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The appellate court will reason that the instruction did not assume a verdict, was not a comment on the evidence, and was properly conditioned on the liability findings preceding it. Furthermore, ample evidence was presented regarding Montes's pre-existing condition, justifying its submission to the jury. Since Singh did not preserve the particular argument about the instruction conflicting with the ""bad result"" instruction, the appellate court will only address the preserved points of contention, which will not meet the threshold for showing that the instruction probably caused the rendition of an improper verdict or judgment."
"An insurance company (appellant) sought review of a judgment awarded by a Colorado County trial court in Texas, which favored the beneficiary, Ardella A. Hicks, and her husband, Ben Hicks (appellees), regarding an action to recover under an accident insurance policy. The policy was issued on June 16, 1897, to Ellis Hicks and insured against death from bodily injuries received through external, violent, and accidental means, worth $3000. However, the policy excluded coverage for deaths that resulted wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, from disease, bodily or mental infirmities, voluntary over-exertion, or voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger.

Ellis Hicks died following an incident that occurred while he was riding a train on April 19, 1898. The train's sudden movement caused him to fall and sustain bodily injuries that resulted in his death on April 22, 1898. Prior to the accident, Ellis Hicks had been suffering from typhoid fever and was under medical care. Against his doctor's advice, he had left his sickbed and was traveling from San Marcos to his mother's home in Columbus, Texas. The insurance company refused to pay, leading the beneficiary and her husband to sue the company, claiming that Ellis Hicks' death resulted from the injuries from the fall. The company, in response, argued that Ellis Hicks' death was not solely due to the accident and injuries as claimed, but also as a result of his diseased condition, involuntary over-exertion, and voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger.

During the trial, the court heard testimonies regarding Ellis Hicks' physical condition just before the accident, the nature of the fall and injuries he sustained, and the cause of his death. The trial court found in favor of the beneficiary and her husband, resulting in the insurance company's appeal.","The appellate court, likely considering the stipulations of the insurance policy and the circumstances preceding and following the accident, will uphold the trial court's judgment that Ellis Hicks' death was caused solely by the bodily injuries received from the external, violent, and accidental event, unconnected to any other causes. The verdict will find that, although Ellis Hicks was suffering from typhoid fever at the time of the accident, the medical evidence provided shows the injuries to his stomach or pyloric orifice were the direct cause of his death, affirming the original conclusion that the pre-existing condition of typhoid fever did not contribute to the accident.

In reasoning, the court will likely review the language and conditions of the insurance policy and apply principles of interpretation that are construed in favor of the insured party when terms are ambiguous or not explicit. The principle that negligence by the insured does not necessarily invalidate a claim under the insurance policy unless such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, will also be considered. Since the evidence does not establish that the diseased condition, voluntary over-exertion, or exposure to unnecessary danger contributed to the accident, these factors cannot operate to negate the policy's coverage.

Furthermore, if the verdict addresses the awarding of the statutory penalty of 12 percent and $500 in attorney's fees, the court will likely dismiss the insurance company's challenge, given that the relevant Texas statute would not be viewed as contravening the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Hence, it is expected that the appellate court will affirm the judgment of the lower court in all respects."
"The plaintiff, Fort Worth Hotel Limited Partnership doing business as Fort Worth Hilton (Fort Worth Hilton), filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Enserch Corporation doing business as Lone Star Gas Company (Lone Star Gas), after a gas explosion on March 16, 1986, caused significant damage to the hotel property. In 1986, construction company L.D. Conatser was performing excavation work near the Frank Kent Cadillac Building when they encountered gas lines that were improperly marked by Lone Star Gas. An explosion occurred, leading to shockwaves that damaged the south tower of the hotel.

Fort Worth Hilton claimed the explosion caused severe structural damage to the south tower, citing cracks in vertical concrete columns, deflected horizontal slabs, and disjointed ceilings and walls. Multiple engineering firms were hired by various parties to inspect the damage, with some findings suggesting the hotel had pre-existing structural problems not built to code, while others linked the damage directly to the explosion.

Both sides presented contrasting views on the state of the hotel before the explosion, the adequacy of Lone Star Gas's line marking and emergency response procedures, and the reasonableness of the hotel's operations post-explosion. The case involved complex pre-trial discovery issues, extensive expert testimony, and a detailed examination of whether the disaster response by Lone Star Gas was grossly negligent.

The jury found Lone Star Gas's negligence to be the proximate cause of the explosion and was instructed that Lone Star Gas’s negligence in a previous lawsuit concerning the same explosion had already been established. However, the jury found that Lone Star Gas's negligence did not amount to gross negligence. The jury also awarded damages to the hotel for repair costs but denied any damages for loss of income or business interruption.","The trial court's judgment in favor of Fort Worth Hilton on repair cost damages will be reversed and a take-nothing judgment will be rendered in favor of Lone Star Gas. The plaintiff established the necessity of repairs due to the explosion damage but failed to prove the reasonableness of the repair costs as required by established principles of law. The testimony regarding the cost of repairs amounted to the plaintiff reading a chart listing alleged damages, the names of companies, and the bills for work carried out, without addressing the necessity or reasonableness of the work in the context of the local market.

The jury's finding that Lone Star Gas was not grossly negligent is supported by sufficient evidence showing that Lone Star Gas did not consciously ignore an extreme risk that would likely cause injury to Fort Worth Hilton. Concerning the damages for business interruption and loss of income, the jury's zero award is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. The plaintiff's arguments did not form a concrete connection between the blast and the claimed losses, thus it was within the jury's province to find a lack of causation based on the evidence presented.

In summary, the plaintiff failed to meet the legal requirements of proving the reasonableness of incurred repair costs and did not provide convincing evidence of gross negligence or causation for lost income or business interruption damages. Therefore, the judgment in favor of the defendant will be made final."
"The plaintiffs, Sam Gann and others, through their guardian J.B. Dismuke, initiated a mandamus proceeding against the Honorable W.O. Murray and the justices of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District, seated in San Antonio, Texas. The proceeding sought to compel the Court of Civil Appeals to certify questions of law regarding venue to the Supreme Court, growing out of a suit for damages where the question of venue was deemed material. This case arose from an incident where the plaintiffs' car collided with the defendants' truck parked beside a highway at night. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to place flares at the mandatory distance from the parked truck as required by Tex. Penal Code art. 827a, § 9-a. Another offense was also alleged, but it was not discussed in detail.

The trial court concluded that the injuries were not proximately caused by the alleged offenses and sustained the defendants' pleas of privilege to change the venue to the defendants' home county. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed this decision, which the plaintiffs then contested, arguing that for the purposes of venue under § 9 of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, the injury did not have to be proximately caused by the crime. The plaintiffs contended that it was sufficient for them to prove that the crime occurred in the county where the suit was pending. In defense of their argument, the plaintiffs cited a conflict between the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals and the previous case Hurley v. Reynolds, which held that proving proximate cause was not necessary to retain the venue in the county of the crime.

The Court of Civil Appeals assumed for the purposes of its opinion that an offense under a valid statute was alleged and proved, without considering whether the penal code in question was repealed or if a valid offense was indeed alleged and proved in the case at bar. Furthermore, the trial court found, based on proof, that flares were placed 80 feet from the parked truck (as opposed to the 150 feet required) and could be seen in time to avoid the collision, leading to the finding that the injuries were not proximately caused by this offense.","The court will likely render a verdict that aligns with the plaintiffs’ argued position, based on an established legal precedent that for venue purposes under § 9, where a suit is based on a crime, it isn’t necessary to prove that injuries were proximately caused by that crime. Instead, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the crime was in fact committed and that it occurred in the county where the suit was pending. The verdict will be underpinned by the concept that the connection between the injury suffered and the crime committed is to be determined as a matter of law from the pleadings, rather than facts requiring proof in a venue hearing. This determination is crucial because it impacts whether the plaintiffs’ suit is legally ""based upon"" the crime in question for the purposes of venue. 

The court will clarify that the defendants are not protected against unfounded factual allegations that the crime was the proximate cause of the injury, as the pleas of privilege are not intended to shield defendants from baseless lawsuits. The decision will emphasize that the plaintiffs are required to prove only the commission and location of the alleged crime according to the established standards for venue questions, not the entire cause of action or the full extent of the claimed damages. Consequently, the court will likely direct the Court of Civil Appeals to conform its ruling and decision to the principles elucidated, answering the certified question in the negative and negating the need for proving proximate cause solely for the determination of venue within the context of § 9."
"Paul Tatum was the son of John and Mary Ann Tatum. At seventeen, he was involved in a severe car accident on his way home from a fast-food run. No evidence suggested he was under any substance influence, but the crash was significant. Paul made his way home, began drinking, and called a friend, indicating erratic behavior. Concerned, the friend visited and found Paul with a firearm. After the friend left the room to alert their parent, a gunshot was heard; Paul had killed himself. The Tatums, linking research on traumatic brain injuries to suicidal ideations, concluded the accident caused Paul's mental state leading to his suicide. They wrote an obituary stating Paul died ""as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident,"" wishing to attribute his suicide to the accident rather than a mental illness. Over 1,000 attended Paul’s funeral.

Columnist Steve Blow wrote a piece in The Dallas Morning News titled ""Shrouding Suicide Leaves its Danger Unaddressed,"" critiquing the tendency to disguise suicides and quoted Paul's obituary without naming the Tatums. The column indicated that Paul's death was suicide, previously undisclosed in the obituary, and emphasized the importance of openness regarding suicide. Blow did not contact the Tatums before writing, and they recognized the article referenced their son. 

The Tatums sued for libel and libel per se against Blow and the paper, claiming the column had a defamatory gist. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants without specifying reasons. On appeal, the court held that the column could be construed to suggest that Paul suffered from untreated mental illness and that his parents failed to honestly confront it, which is defamatory, and remanded for libel claims. The appellate court did not find the column to be an opinion and rejected every possible summary judgment ground.

The News petitioned for review, arguing: the column isn’t capable of defamatory meaning; it expresses non-actionable opinion; it is substantially true; and the court of appeals failed in analyzing actual malice.","The column is reasonably capable of implying that the Tatums acted deceptively in their wording of the obituary, and this implication can be defamatory. However, the accusation will be considered an opinion because the context of the column, using a first-person, informal style with subjective statements, indicates it is presenting a subjective viewpoint rather than an objective assertion of fact. Although the article does not refer to the Tatums by name, the implication that they were deceptive is evident, as Blow uses their obituary as an example to support his viewpoint on society's handling of suicide. 

Moreover, the column’s statement regarding the Tatums’ alleged obituary deception is true. The obituary led readers to believe in a cause of death (automobile accident) that wasn't entirely accurate as it omitted the critical fact of suicide, regardless of the Tatums’ reasons or beliefs. Blow’s column merely reveals the truth that the obituary left out, and therefore it cannot be more damaging to the Tatums' reputation than what is true. Consequently, the trial court's grant of summary judgment will be reinstated, ruling in favor of Blow and The Dallas Morning News, on the grounds that the accusation in the column was an expression of opinion and was, to the extent it implied deception, a true statement."
"Waleska Biaggi was injured as a passenger in a single-car accident caused by the intoxicated driver, Julio Rivera, who had been served alcohol at Patrizio's restaurant, where he worked. Biaggi took Rivera to work on the day of the incident and borrowed his car to visit a friend, but ended up driving the vehicle into a ditch and later required a tow truck. She never made it to her friend's house and had to pick Rivera up from the restaurant at the end of his shift. Upon her arrival at Patrizio's, Rivera was drinking heavily and was visibly intoxicated. Biaggi sat and drank with Rivera and a customer at the restaurant and informed the manager that she would drive both of them home. However, Rivera insisted on driving because she had earlier ditched his car. Despite knowing about Rivera's intoxication, Biaggi, without considering alternative transportation options and citing the fact it was late, decided to let Rivera drive.

While driving out of the restaurant parking lot, Rivera was traveling at high speeds, resulting in loss of control and collision with a commercial pole on the passenger side, leaving Biaggi unconscious and injured. Rivera was legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, while Biaggi was not. Biaggi admitted in her deposition and testimony that she knew the signs of intoxication from her experience in the restaurant industry, understood the dangers of drinking and driving, previously caused accidents due to impairment, and acknowledged making the wrong decision by riding with Rivera. However, she also expressed that she did not expect things to turn out as they did.

Biaggi sued Patrizio's under the Texas Dram Shop Act, alleging that the restaurant continued to serve Rivera when it was clear he was dangerously intoxicated. Patrizio's sought summary judgment, contending that because Biaggi chose to ride with Rivera knowing he was intoxicated, this act constituted a new and independent cause that broke the chain of proximate cause between the restaurant's actions and Biaggi's injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Patrizio's, and Biaggi appealed. The appellate court assessed whether Patrizio's had negated proximate causation as a matter of law and applied the proportionate responsibility framework to determine the extent of Biaggi's contribution to her injuries.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Patrizio's by determining that the restaurant did not conclusively prove that Biaggi's decision to ride with Rivera severed the causal connection between Rivera's intoxication and Biaggi's injury. The court will also establish that it is a jury's responsibility, not a court's, to apply comparative negligence analysis to establish the degree of Biaggi's responsibility. If the jury finds that her negligence was over 50% the cause of her injuries, she would not be entitled to recover damages. However, the court will conclude that Patrizio's liability is not ultimately extinguished by Biaggi's decision to ride with an intoxicated driver.

To predict the reasoning for the verdict, the appellate court will apply several factors from the case law related to the concept of a new and independent cause, which did not convincingly negate the proximate cause on Patrizio's part. It will be found that Biaggi's action in riding with an intoxicated Rivera is not an outside agency separating the causal link, and Biaggi's negligence – even if substantial – does not entirely alleviate the restaurant's liability for serving an obviously intoxicated patron who went on to cause an accident.

The court will reason that Biaggi's actions were not so unforeseeable to be considered extraordinary, and that the injuries resulted from a series of events not entirely detached from Rivera's intoxication and the restaurant's decision to serve him alcohol. Furthermore, since Biaggi's conduct did not create a new and independent cause, it does not outright dismiss the liability of Patrizio's under the Dram Shop Act. Instead, any negligence assigned to Biaggi will be assessed under the Texas Proportionate Responsibility Act during a trial, where jurors will determine the percentages of responsibility among Patrizio's, Rivera, and Biaggi. The appellate court will send the case back to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with their opinion, rejecting the application of summary judgment and allowing for a full jury evaluation of the comparative responsibilities."
"The parents of Ricardo Serna Alvarado, namely Victor and Olga Alvarado, initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the City of Brownsville following Ricardo's suicide at the city jail, where he hung himself with a blanket from the cell bars. Ricardo, a nineteen-year old, was arrested for driving while intoxicated and placed in a detoxification cell by himself. There were no signs that indicated Ricardo was upset, emotional, violent, or suicidal; however, his friends testified that he had been disturbed earlier that day after being rejected by a schoolmate. According to the City of Brownsville Jail Procedures Manual, cell checks were required every twenty minutes, with more frequent checks for potentially suicidal or violent prisoners.

On the day of Ricardo's death, the last cell check by Jailer Perez was at 6:50 p.m. Shortly after, two new prisoners arrived, obstructing the jailers' view of Ricardo's cell during their booking. Ricardo was discovered deceased at 7:20 p.m. The jailers justified their failure to perform timely cell checks by claiming that booking procedures had priority over cell checks. At trial, evidence was presented regarding jail procedures, but other evidence concerning the personnel history of one of the jailers, a prior suicide attempt, state jail standards, and identification of suicidal inmates was excluded by the trial court.

The jury was asked if city negligence caused Ricardo's death, if Ricardo's own negligence caused his death, and the percentages of negligence attributable to each. They concluded the city was not negligent but found Ricardo's negligence caused his own death, and did not answer the question regarding percentages since it was contingent on an affirmative answer to both prior questions.

The appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial, finding that the trial court had improperly excluded evidence and had confused the jury by asking about Ricardo's negligence. An application for writ of error was filed by the city, arguing that any trial court error was harmless since the jury had sufficient evidence to arrive at a proper judgment. The appellate court's decision was based on the notion that the exclusion of evidence potentially impacted the trial's outcome.","The verdict will reverse the decision of the appellate court and render judgment in favor of the city. The reasoning will be that despite the appellate court's concerns, the errors made by the trial court were considered harmless. The verdict will determine that the questions regarding Ricardo's negligence did not sway the jury's decision since the jury concluded that the city was not the proximate cause of his death regardless of Ricardo's actions. It will be decided that the questions presented to the jury were neither ambiguous nor misleading, focusing on responsibility rather than the cause of death, which was not contested.

The verdict will also address the exclusion of evidence by the trial court, concluding that excluding such evidence was within the court's discretion and did not likely affect the judgment’s outcome. The decision to exclude evidence related to policy formulation will be justified on the basis of preserving sovereign immunity for the city, while holding that it waived immunity for negligent implementation claims, and even if such evidence was included, it is not probable that the outcome would have differed. The evidence that was admitted to trial, including the jail manual and testimony regarding jail procedures and jailer actions, will be considered sufficient for the jury to deliberate and decide if the city failed to properly implement its policies. The cumulative review will determine that the evidence presented at trial provided a complete enough picture to argue whether the jailers acted negligently within the established city policy. The court will conclude that the Alvarados failed to prove the exclusion of evidence had probably led to an improper judgment. Therefore, a judgment will be rendered that the Alvarados recover nothing from their claims against the city."
"George J. McLean (McLean) worked as a Systems Technician for Southwestern Bell and had been engaged in repairing service lines owned by MCI but situated at Apache Corporation’s (Apache) offices. On February 5, 1987, he checked in with Apache's receptionist Gloria Wright (Wright) and office manager Ann Hammonds (Hammonds) carrying his tools and a Hewlett Packard set. The following day, Apache’s telephone systems man, Weldon Sikes (Sikes), noticed a Customer Access Panel (CAP) leased from AT&T was missing. Upon McLean’s return to complete his work, Sikes accused him of the theft. Wright and Hammonds supported Sikes' accusation, with Wright claiming she saw McLean leave with the CAP. McLean denied the theft and offered to display his equipment; Hammonds, disinterested, requested him to leave. Hammonds, instructed by Apache security head Greg Pyles (Pyles), called the police and initiated proceedings that led to McLean's arrest. McLean was arrested at his workplace, booked, and jailed overnight before a probable cause hearing the next day.

Meanwhile, on February 18, the CAP was found by an AT&T employee who had mistaken it for another piece of equipment, leading to its accidental removal. McLean’s innocence became apparent, but he was not immediately notified. Charges were eventually dropped; however, Apache did not inform McLean or apologize for the false accusation.

McLean sued Apache, Hammonds, and Wright for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and negligence. The jury favored McLean on all claims. Apache then moved for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict which the trial court granted on all issues except negligence and related damages. Both parties appealed.

Key facts include that McLean had no criminal record, the CAP and McLean's equipment were dissimilar, and the actual CAP was taken by mistake from Apache's office due to an AT&T employee's error. Testimony conflicted between witnesses. Some testified to McLean's innocence, while Wright, Hammonds, and Sikes claimed certainty of his guilt. There were questions as to whether McLean was adequately free to leave during confrontations, and whether Apache’s employees maliciously or negligently instigated legal action against him without probable cause.","The appellate court found that the evidence supported the jury's verdict favoring McLean on his malicious prosecution claim, determining the criminal prosecution commenced by Apache’s employees lacked probable cause, and terminated in McLean’s favor demonstrating his innocence. The appellate court would likely hold that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's finding of exemplary damages, and that the false imprisonment judgment should be upheld as the jury was entitled to believe McLean’s version of events. Regarding negligence, the appellate court would reverse the trial court's judgment for McLean, due to a lack of separate and distinct damages attributable to negligence beyond those for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.

On factual insufficiency cross-points surrounding the findings of lack of probable cause and malice, exemplary damages, and false imprisonment, the appellate court would validate the jury's determination. The evidence demonstrated Apache, through its employees, initiated the prosecution of McLean knowingly and without probable cause, acting with reckless disregard for his rights. The employees’ failure to act upon learning McLean’s innocence would be emphasized.

The appellate court would conclude that the actual damage award was supported by malicious prosecution and false imprisonment discovered by the jury; exemplary damages were reasonable and proportionate to actual damages. The employees’ actions proximately caused McLean's damages.

The appellate court would reverse and render the negligence claim, remand for entry of the jury’s verdict on malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, actual damages, and exemplary damages, determining that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's liability findings. The verdict against McLean regarding negligence would then be reversed, resulting in a take-nothing judgment on that claim, thereby giving effect to the jury's verdict in all respects."
"The lawsuit involved an incident where Jimmy Harrison, an employee of subcontractor KK Glass, fell from the tenth story of a hospital building to his death while installing glass glazing. Lee Lewis Construction, Inc. (LLC), the general contractor, was sued by Jimmy's family (Norma Harrison, individually and as the next friend of her children Sumer Dawn and Jimmy Thor Harrison, and May and Sellie Harrison) for negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence. KK Glass was also sued for gross negligence by the family but settled before trial. LLC filed a cross-claim against KK Glass for contractual indemnity or contribution, which was granted summary judgment by the trial court.

A jury found that LLC retained ""the right to control safety"" at the construction site, and found LLC both negligent and grossly negligent. As a result, the jury awarded compensatory and exemplary damages to the Harrison family. LLC challenged this verdict, particularly the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the finding of negligence and the award of exemplary damages, the accuracy of a jury issue submitted by the court, the admission of evidence allegedly depicting subsequent remedial measures, and the validity of the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to KK Glass.

The procedural background included LLC's assertion that it did not retain an unqualified duty to ensure a safe workplace for the employees of its subcontractors, but to ensure that any safety measures enacted did not increase the risk of harm. The case presented complex questions concerning the extent of the duty of a general contractor regarding safety measures and the subcontractor’s independence in matters of safety, and whether LLC assumed a duty to affirmatively act vis-a-vis matters of safety, including the use of fall protection equipment.}","{The appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court’s judgment regarding the award against LLC for negligence and gross negligence while also affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment to KK Glass. The court may agree that legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that LLC retained the right to control safety and was negligent and grossly negligent in exercising that control. The prediction is that the court would reason that LLC did more than merely require subcontractors to abide by general safety measures, as evidenced by the contracts between LLC and Methodist hospital, in which LLC agreed to supervise and direct the work, be responsible for construction means and methods, and maintain and supervise all safety precautions and programs, including the protection and safety of subcontractor employees.

Furthermore, the appellate court would likely consider the stipulations set forth in the contract between LLC and KK Glass, which included the required adherence to safety rules, providing a first aid kit, and allowing LLC to remove non-compliant KK Glass employees from the site. The frequent mentions of safety, the initiative that LLC took to oversee and enforce safety, and LLC's president's admission that LLC ""wanted responsibility of"" safety on the job site, including making sure that subcontractors worked safely, will substantiate the jury's conclusion that LLC had a significant degree of control over job safety.

Regarding the claim for excessive damages for pain and mental anguish, the court may call for a remittitur due to the award being factually excessive based on the duration of suffering before Jimmy's death. A detailed comparison of prior case awards for conscious pain and suffering may lead the court to significantly reduce LLC's compensatory damages.

As for LLC's cross-claim against KK Glass, the appellate court will probably uphold the summary judgment granted in favor of KK Glass, finding that LLC failed to satisfy the express negligence rule, which requires specific contractual language to indemnify a party from its own negligence. The court will distinguish between indemnity and contribution and will likely point out that contractual indemnity is not the same as contribution, which is unavailable here due to the exclusive remedy provision under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act. The court will consider LLC's arguments in its cross-claim, particularly the broad language seeking indemnity from ""any and all damages,"" as indicative of seeking full indemnity, not limited for damages solely caused by KK Glass, which ultimately does not meet the express negligence requirement.

Taken together, given the detailed evidence of contractual obligations, safety program requirements, LLC's supervision at the construction site, witness testimony, and existing legal principles on indemnification and contribution, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's ruling on LLC’s gross negligence and summary judgment for KK Glass while suggesting a remittitur on the pain and suffering damages awarded to Jimmy's estate.}"
"The appellant, a power company, sought review of the decision from the trial court in Texas that found in favor of the appellee survivors of the decedents in a negligence suit. The decedents included Doc Franklin Webster and two others who were killed by coming into contact with the appellant's transmission line that was brought down by a lightning strike. The tragic event occurred after the decedents' car stopped, presumably out of gasoline, and they went to search for fuel, ending up in a cotton field where the sagging power lines were located. The farm was owned by J. M. Carter and rented to Mr. Mack Atnip but cultivated by a tenant named Frog Jackson. The lines were supposed to be at least 22 feet above ground as per statutory requirements, but due to the lightning strike, they were sagging about 3 feet above ground at the time of the incident.

Doc Webster was traveling with his wife, brother, and brother-in-law, looking for work but could not find any due to excessive rains. They were returning home when their car ceased to function. Webster's brother, Tom Webster, and brother-in-law, Bowen Daniels, left in search of gasoline, while Doc and his wife remained in the car. It was alleged that Tom and Bowen inadvertently wandered into the field where the power line was sagging and were electrocuted. Hearing calls for help, Doc went to assist and was also electrocuted. 

The appellees' suit argued that the power company was negligent in various ways, including not maintaining the minimum height for its power lines, failing to warn persons of the low-hanging wires, failing to cut off electricity to the sagging lines, allowing the wires to fall and remain near the ground, and not having a watchman present to caution individuals about the condition. The appellant countered with claims including a general demurrer pleading that the decedents were trespassers; pleas of unavoidable accident; an act of God (lightning); contributory negligence of the deceased; and that deceased, at the time of death, was trespassing upon the premises.

The trial court overruled the appellant's general demurrer, did not instruct a verdict in the appellant's favor on the trespassing claim, and submitted the case to a jury, which found in favor of the appellees. The jury found the power company's actions to be actionable negligence and absolved Doc Webster of negligence. The appellant did not dispute the jury’s findings but maintained that the court erred in various ways, including in refusing to instruct a verdict on account of trespassing, not defining certain phrases in the court's definition of proximate cause, and objecting to issues submitted on the measure of damages. The trial court's judgment awarded damages to the beneficiaries of the decedents, totaling $23,000.","It will be predicted that the appellate court will affirm the decision of the lower court that found in favor of the appellee survivors of the decedents in the negligence suit brought against the appellant power company. This affirmation will be based on the finding that the lower court did not err in overruling the appellant's general demurrer. The decedents will have been found not to be trespassers at the time of their deaths, and the power company owed a duty of care to individuals that could reasonably be expected to be within the vicinity of the sagging lines. The court will likely determine that the appellant acquired right of way through a deed by the owner for the purpose of constructing and maintaining power lines and did not prevent the owner, or anyone else, from using the ground under the lines so long as such use was consistent with the reasonable enjoyment of the easement. 

The court will probably affirm the trial court's instruction to the jury on the negligence of appellant in not repairing the lines after being aware of their condition and keeping them charged with electricity. The existence of a communal custom allowing passage through lands cannot be used to classify an individual as a trespasser under such circumstances. Furthermore, the court will likely consider the response to a distress call, not as trespassing, but as an action to help others in distress, which would be expected of any reasonable person. 

The appellant's multiple objections to the propositions submitted to the jury will be considered immaterial because the facts supporting the propositions will be found to be undisputed, including the reception of notice of the line's condition and the failure to make repairs or issue warnings. 

The contributory negligence claim will not have been raised by the evidence, as the decedents could not have anticipated the presence of the low-hanging wires and had not been informed of any potential danger. The issues surrounding contributory negligence and acts of God would have been correctly refused by the trial court since they were not supported by the evidence. Any errors in the court proceedings the appellant contends, such as the exclusion of certain testimonies, admission of notice evidence, or definitions within instructions, will be considered harmless in the overall determination of the company's negligence and will not warrant a reversal of the judgment. Thus, the appellant's motion for rehearing will be overruled, and the original judgment will stand affirmed."
"The case involves a wrongful death suit filed by Natalie Halepeska and her children for the death of Dennis L. Halepeska, their husband and father, respectively. The defendant is Callihan Interests, Inc. Dennis Halepeska, an independent geologist, along with Mr. D.F. Morris, was killed in a gas well blowout owned by Callihan. Halepeska and Morris had gone to the Smith lease to ""blow down"" a gas well that had been previously drilled but not fully completed. Although the well was known to have high pressure, Callihan had only provisional equipment in place that was not fully secure.

On the fateful day, Morris and Halepeska were at the well site to open the well's valves, with no eyewitnesses to the accident. The equipment arrangement on the well was such that when the valves were opened rapidly, it led to a jet-like back pressure, which caused the equipment to unhook, ultimately resulting in the fatal incident. Despite their extensive experience and knowledge of wells, and their belief it should be blown harder to remove water from the well, the jury found they did not have full knowledge of how the well was equipped nor appreciate the risk involved in opening the valves.

The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioners, awarding $85,000. It disregarded the jury answers to some issues but accepted their finding that Halepeska did not have full knowledge of the danger. The Court of Civil Appeals, however, reversed the trial court's decision and rendered judgment for Callihan, asserting that the danger was open and obvious and that Halepeska voluntarily exposed himself to known risks. The jury's findings regarding Halepeska's lack of full knowledge and appreciation for the danger were deemed not controlling by the lower court.","In the case, the Court of Civil Appeals erred in reversing the judgment of the trial court and rendering judgment for the respondent, Callihan, because they incorrectly determined as a matter of law that Halepeska had actual or imputed knowledge and appreciation of the danger when the jury had expressly found otherwise. The court should have upheld the trial court's ruling which was predicated on the jury's determination that Halepeska did not have full knowledge of the well's setup and did not appreciate the danger involved, thus making him a business invitee entitled to protection from non-obvious dangers on the property.

When determining the reasoning for the verdict, the court should recognize that the doctrines of ""no duty""—where no duty is owed for open and obvious risks—and ""volenti non fit injuria"" (voluntary assumption of risk) require actual knowledge and appreciation of the specific danger, or such an apparent risk that the law charges a person with that knowledge and appreciation. In this case, the jury did not find that Halepeska had such actual knowledge or appreciation, nor can the law impute this to him simply because he exposed himself to the risks associated with ""blowing"" the well.

Therefore, the trial court correctly disregarded the jury's answers that suggested Halepeska should have known and appreciated the danger, as such a standard does not apply to either the ""no duty"" or ""volenti"" doctrines. The focus on what Halepeska should have done in the exercise of ordinary care (which may suggest contributory negligence) does not preempt the jury's clear findings on his actual knowledge and appreciation for the danger before the accident occurred.

Further, the court should remand the matter so that the Court of Civil Appeals can properly consider if the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's findings, rather than preemptively deciding the sufficiency of evidence on their own accord. Hence, the appellate court should review and pass on Callihan's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence based on the detailed facts established by the trial court and jury, which demonstrate that Halepeska did not know of the specific and exact risks that caused the fatal accident."
"The appellant public utilities (San Angelo Water, Light & Power Company and Texas Electric & Power Company) were engaged in a negligence action brought by the appellee, B. E. Baugh, an employee of the San Angelo Telephone Company. Baugh filed a suit against the appellants for personal injuries he sustained at his workplace. The injury occurred when Baugh, who worked at the switchboard, contacted the public utilities to report that their high-power electric line was interfering with the switchboard operations. He requested that they turn off the current, which they did not do, and subsequently Baugh was injured when electricity from the high-power line entered the telephone apparatus and electrocuted him.

The appellants presented a defense with arguments including a general denial, contributory negligence, and assumed risk. During the trial, evidence was provided by various witnesses, including testimony from John Y. Rust, president of the telephone company, regarding payment made to the telephone company by the appellants for damages to the switchboard. This was used to demonstrate an admission against interest. The control and condition of the high-power line, the static line, and the associated safety equipment were all at issue, with evidence presented that the safety mechanisms did not function as they should have, suggesting negligence on the part of the appellants.

A key part of the defense's argument was the refusal to recognize the cashier's authority to bind the corporation in acknowledging the payment for damages, claiming the individual had no such authority to make admissions against the appellants’ interest. However, testimony suggested that payments were indeed made and settled against appellants’ bills, and there were no demands made by the appellants for a return of payments which suggest an admission of liability. The case also hinged on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, implying negligence because the accident is one that does not usually occur without negligence and was within the exclusive control of the appellants.","The verdict will affirm the trial court's decision in favor of the appellee, B. E. Baugh. The judgment will be based on several key points of rationale. Firstly, the testimony from nonexperts about Baugh's change in disposition post-accident will be deemed admissible as it indicates a potential impact from the injury and is within the permissible range of nonexpert testimony on changes in a person's condition. This testimony is considered relevant as it tends to show some ill effects from the electric shock upon Baugh's physical being.

Additionally, the payment made by the public utilities for the damages to the telephone company’s switchboard will be viewed as an admission against interest, suggesting that the appellants recognized liability for the damages resulting from their negligent actions. Even though the appellants contested the cashier's authority to make the admission, the evidence will support that the cashier, as the agent of the appellants, had apparent authority to accept payment, thus confirming the settlement and the resultant admissions of liability.

In terms of the defense's argument regarding the act of the cat as an uncontrollable event, the court will dismiss this explanation as unpersuasive because it fails to adequately address the established negligence on the part of the appellants in maintaining the high-power line.

Applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the verdict will conclude that it was the appellants' negligent conduct that allowed the excessive and dangerous amount of electricity to escape and injure the appellee. Given that the injury is of the nature that it would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence by the entity controlling the high-power line, and the appellants failed to cut off the power when alerted to the interference, the verdict will determine that the appellants are liable for Baugh’s injuries.

Concerning the award amount, the verdict will consider the quantum of damages reasonable and not a result of passion, prejudice, or partiality on the part of the jury. The scope of Baugh’s injuries and their impact on his health and quality of life will justify the judgment amount awarded to him. Therefore, the decision of the trial court awarding $4,500 in damages will be upheld, thus affirming the judgment."
"Pete Arguello consulted Dr. Dennis Gutzman due to pain in his right knee. Dr. Gutzman diagnosed Arguello with a torn medial meniscus and proceeded to operate. During the arthroscopic surgery, a piece of the meniscus grabber broke and became lodged in Arguello’s knee. An additional arthrotomy surgery was required to remove the broken piece. Arguello was then released from the hospital and underwent physical therapy. Arguello and his wife subsequently filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Gutzman, alleging misrepresentation, lack of informed consent, and negligence, particularly regarding the use and prior inspection of the surgical instrument. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Gutzman, supported by an affidavit from Dr. Gutzman himself, which included his account of the surgery, a statement of adherence to the standard of care, and a denial of negligence or contribution to Arguello’s injuries. The Arguellos responded by asserting that Dr. Gutzman’s affidavits contained conclusory statements that raised factual disputes regarding the use of the instrument. They argued that res ipsa loquitur applied given the nature of the incident, specifically that the instrument would not have broken without negligence on Dr. Gutzman's part.","The court affirmed the summary judgment granted in favor of Dr. Gutzman. It will hold that the affidavit of an interested expert witness like Dr. Gutzman is admissible to support a summary judgment if the affidavit meets the standards of Rule 166a in that it is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and is readily controvertible. Since Dr. Gutzman is both the physician and an expert in the matter, his testimony regarding not having breached any standards of care and not being the proximate cause of the injury were deemed sufficient evidence to shift the burden of proof to the Arguellos. The Arguellos were then obliged to present a controverting expert testimony of their own, which they failed to do.

  The court will also discuss the principle of res ipsa loquitur, which the Arguellos attempted to invoke, arguing that the type of incident that occurred (i.e., a medical instrument breaking during surgery) would typically not happen without negligence. However, the court will predict that this doctrine is generally not applied directly to medical malpractice cases unless the situation involves matters within the common knowledge of laymen, such as misuse of a mechanical instrument or leaving objects inside a patient after surgery. The court will rule that in this case, the application of the doctrine is not appropriate since the intricacies of the use of arthroscopic surgical instruments would not be within the layperson's common knowledge.
  
  Consequently, because the Arguellos did not produce an expert witness to rebut Dr. Gutzman's claims, the standard of care and causation remain uncontested by expert testimony. Thus, the verdict will affirm the summary judgment on behalf of Dr. Gutzman, with the opinion concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact concerning the breach of duty and proximate cause that would preclude summary judgment.

"James Palacio, also known by the nickname ""Larry,"" was a victim of a shooting incident inside the Riveraine Apartments property where he was staying in an apartment with Margarita Morin-Gonzales's brother, Ruben Morin, and her two sons. The incident occurred around 1 a.m. while Morin-Gonzales was incarcerated. Ruben Morin answered a knock at the door to find a man asking for ""Larry"" to sell him a ring. After informing Palacio of the visitor, Morin left the door ajar, and when Palacio conversed with the visitor, a second man shot him. Palacio sustained severe injuries from the gunshot.

Palacio filed a lawsuit against the apartment owner, AON Properties; the management company, Greystar Management Services; and the security provider, Weiser Security Services, asserting allegations of negligence and gross negligence and seeking damages. His case contended that the defendants collectively failed to provide a safe environment, contributing to his injuries. The defendants joined ""John Does 1-4"" as responsible third parties. The trial court later granted summary judgment motions in favor of AON, Greystar, and Weiser, leading to Palacio's appeal. Central to the dispute before the appellate court was the issue of proximate cause and whether the deliberate nature of the third-party criminal act could be a superseding cause of the injury, negating the proximity of any alleged negligence on the defendants' part.","In the prediction of the verdict, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The defense will successfully argue that the specific, targeted nature of the criminal act which led to Palacio’s injuries constituted a superseding cause. This criminal act will be determined to be unforeseeable and extraordinary compared to the general kind of harm that might result from the defendants' negligence. The appellate court's reasoning will hinge on the principle that proximate cause consists of cause-in-fact and foreseeability, and that a superseding cause can negate the need to prove proximate cause when it concerns deliberate criminal conduct. 

Despite Palacio's judicial admission of the targeted, deliberate nature of the crime, even Morin's assertion of witnessing a single man at the door who later became an accomplice to a second, hidden assailant, will not suffice to establish liability on the part of AON, Greystar, or Weiser. The protective order and decisions regarding the identity and deposition of witnesses, including errors in preserving objections for appeal, will not play a significant role in the verdict. Palacio's inability to present evidence of any specific threat or reason the defendants could have anticipated the criminal act will lead to the upholding of the summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Moreover, the appellate court will determine that the defendants' actions or possible negligence did not create a situation that contributed to the execution of the crime, as the assailants' deliberate intent was independent of any security measures or lack thereof. The principles outlined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 442 will further support the court's analysis, reinforcing the view that the defendants could not have anticipated the highly targeted and individualized nature of this criminal act."
"The case involves appellants, who are minors and their relatives, seeking a writ of error to review a judgment from the Texas Court of Appeals for the Seventh District, which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellee, a boys club. The appellants had sued the boys club for negligence and deceptive trade practices after a volunteer at the club sexually abused the appellant minors on outings that were not sponsored by the club.

Boyd Ray Mullens, the volunteer, had been convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) twice before volunteering at the Boys Club in Mesquite, Texas. The Boys Club did not conduct a thorough investigation or screen Mullens’ application, which led to him volunteering and later sexually abusing the appellant minors during non-club outings. The plaintiffs are the minor Coe brothers, their grandparents and guardians Mr. and Mrs. Coe, the minor C.G. Doe, and his mother Ms. C.J. Doe. The Coes enrolled their grandchildren in the club, after being assured by the club’s education director that the volunteers were ""checked out thoroughly.""

Mrs. V.M. Coe, before allowing Mullens to take her grandsons camping, asked club personnel about him and was told that ""he seemed to be okay"" without revealing his status as a court-referred probationer. The trial court granted the Boys Club’s motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding there was no proximate cause for negligence and no producing cause for the Deceptive Trade and Practices Act (DTPA) claims.","The court will affirm the trial court’s ruling, finding that the appellants failed to demonstrate key elements of each of their claims against the Boys Club, specifically in establishing both proximate and producing cause. It is reasoned that even if the Boys Club had a duty to investigate volunteers, and indeed breached it, this breach was not the factual cause of the appellants' injuries. There is no evidence suggesting that knowledge of Mullens’ past DWI convictions would have changed the club's decision to accept him as a volunteer or would have allowed the Boys Club to foresee his assaults on the children.

Moreover, the court will hold that while the Boys Club's education director knew Mullens was a court-referred probationer, this fact was not disclosed to the appellants during a time that could be considered part of a ""transaction"" under the DTPA, hence it cannot constitute a failure to disclose under the Act. Furthermore, even if there had been misrepresentations about investigating volunteers, the appellants' own investigation and the nature of the relationship developed between the Coes and Mullens sever the causal connection to the Boys Club's statements as a substantial factor in the resulting injuries.

Because the appellants cannot establish that the Boys Club's conduct was a substantial factor in the injuries without which the harm would not have occurred, nor can they show that the Boys Club could have reasonably anticipated the assaults from Mullens based on the provided information, the court will determine that there is no proximate cause in the negligence claims or producing cause in the DTPA claims. Hence, the summary judgment in favor of the appellee will be justified and affirmed."
"This case involves appellants, consisting of a widow and her children, who sought to recover damages for the death of their family member, Allen Bragg. They alleged that his death was caused by the negligence of the agents and employees of the appellee employer, during the operation of a truck on a public highway near Houston, Texas. 

The incident that led to the lawsuit occurred when employees of the appellee were driving a truck to Houston after recovering another truck owned by the appellee that had been disabled near Wortham, Texas. On their way back, the employees came across a Ford car in a ditch by the highway. After assisting the car and unfastening the chain from their truck, an automobile, in which the deceased and another individual were riding, crashed into the rear of the disabled truck without lights on at the time of the collision, leading to a fatal explosion and fire. 

The issue of whether the employees were acting in the scope of their employment when they stopped to assist the Ford car was central to the case. During the course of the trial, additional issues such as the intoxication and speed of the driver of the automobile in which Allen Bragg was a passenger, as well as the alleged improper questioning by the attorney for the defendant concerning the personal histories of the plaintiffs' witnesses, were raised. 

In response to special issues from the trial court, the jury found that the driver of the automobile failed to keep a proper lookout and was driving at an excessive speed, both determined as proximate causes of the collision, but also found that the driver was not driving negligently just prior to the collision. Appellants appealed the original verdict in favor of the defendant, questioning the alleged conflicting jury findings and the admittance of certain evidences.","The court will affirm the decision of the trial court, ruling in favor of the employer. The key findings of the jury that the driver of the automobile in which the deceased was a passenger was negligent in keeping a lookout and was driving at an excessive speed will be seen as specific findings that control over the general finding that the automobile was not being driven negligently just prior to the collision. This perspective aligns with precedent cases where specific findings are given more weight when reconciling a verdict with seemingly conflicting results.

The court will consider the improper questioning by the defense attorney as harmless because the record will show that the objections were sustained and the witnesses for the plaintiffs did not testify concerning the manner of the accident. As such, it will be deemed that the improper questioning did not unduly influence the jury's findings, particularly in relation to the driver's outlook and speed at the time of the collision.

Furthermore, the testimony concerning the driver's prior acts of fast driving or drinking will not be seen as materially affecting the outcome because the jury's findings on these issues were in favor of the appellants; hence any error in admitting this evidence will be regarded as non-prejudicial.

Ultimately, the verdict will be based on the determination that at the time of the collision, the employees were engaged in an act outside the scope of their employment—assisting a third party—which will reflect a deviation from serving the employer's interests. The court will reference established legal principles in this area, indicating that a servant stepping aside from the master's business for some unrelated purpose temporarily suspends the employment relationship, absolving the master of liability for the servant's acts during such time.

Due to this deviation from the master's business by the employees in assisting the Ford car, the appellee employer will not be held liable for the negligence of its employees, and the judgment in favor of the appellee will be upheld."
"Richard Hollas Rogge was arrested for driving while intoxicated and placed in a holding cell at the City of Richmond police station. The cell included a metal grate covering an air vent, positioned directly above a toilet. Rogge was left alone for approximately three hours during which he committed suicide using his shirt to hang himself from the metal grate.

The plaintiffs, Rogge's parents, sued the City of Richmond and two police officers, presenting civil rights violations under federal law and causes of action under the Texas Tort Claims Act in both federal and state courts. The federal court entered a take-nothing judgment on federal claims and remanded the remaining state-law claims back to the district court.

In their state claims, the Rogges alleged negligence, wrongful-death, and survival claims tied to both the use and condition of the metal grate, stating it presented an unreasonable risk of harm as it was easily accessible to a person intending self-harm. They insisted that the metal grate, due to its size and lack of mesh backing, was a premises defect.

The City of Richmond motioned for summary judgment based on governmental immunity, contending the suicide was not caused by a condition or use of tangible property. It also invoked the discretionary-function exception to the limited waiver of immunity outlined in the Tort Claims Act.

The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment. The Rogges appealed, arguing that the city's use of tangible personal property and a condition of that property caused the death, and that the discretionary-function exception did not apply to their premises defect cause of action.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment favoring the City. It determined that the Rogges' claim was properly classified as a premises-defect claim rather than one based on the use of tangible personal property. The verdict will note that the plaintiffs' lawsuit depends on the duty of care that the City owed to people in the holding cell and not on any affirmative actions by the city's employees. 

The verdict will explain that for a condition of property to waive governmental immunity, it must make the property inherently dangerous during its intended use, and there must be a direct nexus between the property's condition and the injury. Since there was no evidence to suggest that the metal grating was inherently dangerous in its designed function as an air vent cover, or that the grate's condition actually caused Rogge's suicide, the statutory waiver of governmental immunity does not apply.

Additionally, the verdict will communicate that despite the Rogges having amended their petition in response to the jurisdictional challenge, they have not suggested any potential amendments that could cure the pleading defects. Given that the defect noted must pose a hazard in intended regular use, which was not established here, a remand for further amendments would be pointless.

Therefore, the verdict of the appellate court will be rooted in the lack of evidence supporting that the metal grating was a hazardous condition during ordinary use, and that the condition of the grate led to Rogge's death, thus afflicting the waiver of governmental immunity. Consequently, the court will lack subject-matter jurisdiction over the Rogges' claims."
"Appellant motorist, Grant Morris, was injured when his vehicle collided with a tractor-trailer operated by Jerry Lee Largent on a Saturday night. Largent was intoxicated at the time of the accident and was driving the tractor-trailer from his sister's home to the owner's maintenance yard after a personal errand. The vehicle belonged to Hammer Trucking, Inc., which had entered into an exclusive equipment lease agreement with JTM Materials, Inc. for the operation of the leased equipment. Both JTM and Hammer Trucking retained rights to control the operation and supervision of the leased equipment. JTM determined Largent was qualified to drive the tractor-trailer based on a background check and drug screening test. However, JTM failed to acquire a Department of Public Safety driving report for Largent or conduct a criminal background check.

Following the accident, Morris sued JTM and DVC, Inc. for various claims surrounding the theories of negligent hiring, retention, supervision, entrustment, respondeat superior, borrowed servant, joint enterprise, civil conspiracy, and vicarious liability. JTM moved for summary judgment which the trial court granted, without stating its grounds, on all of Morris's claims, except the claims of negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and entrustment, which were reversed and remanded. Morris contended that JTM was subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) and therefore vicariously liable as a matter of law for Largent’s negligence. Morris also argued JTM had a duty to control the tractor-trailer’s operation according to the equipment lease agreement and Texas statutes.","The part of the summary judgment relating to vicarious liability, negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, and negligent entrustment claims was reversed and those claims remanded. The appellate court found that, if JTM is an interstate motor carrier, they are vicariously liable as a matter of law under the FMCSR for Largent's negligence. They also decided that JTM's claim that the vehicle had not been dispatched for JTM and Largent's lacked authorization to drive the vehicle did not conclusively establish that Largent's driving while intoxicated on the date of the accident was not reasonably foreseeable, thus not establishing new and independent cause.

The part of the summary judgment on the respondeat superior, civil conspiracy, joint venture, and joint enterprise claims, and the denial of Morris's motion for partial summary judgment, were affirmed. The court found no evidence that Largent was in the course and scope of his employment during the accident. The designation of Hammer Trucking as an independent contractor was not found to be unlawful, and since Hammer Trucking and JTM did not share an equal right to control the leased equipment or manage the enterprise, there was no joint enterprise or venture. Therefore, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment on those claims. The appellate court's decision was based on the evidence presented and the interpretations of statutory and common law obligations of an interstate motor carrier and the duties relating to the control and operation of the leased equipment."
"A cotton farmer in Galveston, Texas, purchased a product from a druggist intended to destroy cotton worms. Unbeknownst to both parties, the druggist mistakenly supplied the farmer with the wrong product—chrome green instead of Paris green. The farmer used the incorrect product on his crops, expecting it to protect his cotton from the cotton worm. When the product failed to eradicate the worms, the farmer's entire cotton crop was destroyed. Arguing that the loss was due to a breach of implied warranty, the farmer sought consequential damages against the druggist for the entirety of the crop loss. 

The druggist acknowledged that he was responsible for providing the farmer with the wrong product, but contended that his liability should be limited to the difference in value between the product sold (Paris green) and the product delivered (chrome green), not for the consequential damages of the entire crop loss. The lower court supported the druggist's argument by sustaining general and special demurrers, effectively dismissing the farmer's claim for consequential damages.

The farmer appealed, asserting that there was indeed a breach of an implied contract, entitling him to repudiate the purchase due to non-conformity. The farmer also claimed that this breach of contract should be seen as the proximate cause of his crop loss. However, there was no privity of contract for the portion of the crop he did not own, and therefore he could not recover for loss of that portion of the crop.","Given the detailed circumstances, the higher court will likely find that the druggist’s mistake was indeed a breach of an implied contract and that the mistake directly led to the destruction of the farmer's cotton crop. As there was an expectation backed by the implied contract that the supplied product was indeed Paris green, necessary to prevent destruction from cotton worms, the failure to supply the contracted chemical is at the heart of the issue. 

Despite the druggist's lack of fraudulent intent, the farmer relied on the delivery of the specific product to avoid known, natural, and predictable damage from cotton worms, so the breach should be deemed the proximate cause for the crop's destruction. The court will likely reason that the consequences of this breach, like the loss of the crop, should have been foreseeable to the druggist, given the clear purpose for the use of the Paris green. 

The court will probably elaborate that the damages recoverable by the farmer will include the actual value of the loss sustained, specifically, the worth of the crop as it stood prior to destruction, plus costs incurred from using the ineffective product, and any other expenses directly related to the breach. 

However, an important caveat will be that the farmer’s damages may be limited if it is found that, through due diligence, he could have prevented or lessened the loss. For example, if the farmer, after recognizing the product's ineffectiveness, could have sourced the correct Paris green in time to save part of the crop, damages awarded may be reduced accordingly.

Additionally, since the farmer initially only owned half of the crop, his ability to recover damages is limited to his specific interest in the crop at the time of the destruction. Any subsequent arrangement he made with the co-owners for purchase or liens for his advances would not retroactively entitle him to damages for their portion of the crop. If it is found that he had a legitimate lien on the other half to secure advances, then he may be entitled to recover damages to the extent necessary to satisfy that lien, but no more.

Given these considerations, the higher court will likely reverse the lower court's judgment and remand the case, instructing the lower court to apply these principles during a new trial."
"The appellant, Frederick Burkhardt, initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the appellee, Dr. Baker, stemming from the treatment of Burkhardt's shattered tibia sustained in March 1982. Dr. Baker, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, operated on Burkhardt and placed an internal fixation device in his leg to stabilize the fractured bone. Later, Burkhardt developed severe leg pain and was diagnosed with osteomyelitis, a bone infection, by Dr. Geraldine Miller, an infectious disease specialist, who advised removing the entire fixation device to effectively treat the infection. Dr. Baker, however, decided against removing it and only removed a loose screw during a subsequent surgery in July 1982. Dr. Miller observed the worsening infection and its additional complications, but it was not until September 1982 that Dr. Baker removed the fixation device following a new hospitalization.

Baker later applied an external fixation device and performed additional surgeries, including a bone graft and a skin graft. Despite these treatments, Burkhardt continued to suffer from osteomyelitis throughout 1983. In early 1984, he sought treatment from Dr. Michael Drew in Boston, who performed a successful debridement of the infection after administering antibiotics.

In May 1984, Burkhardt filed the lawsuit alleging negligence on the part of Dr. Baker for not removing the internal fixation device in July 1982. The jury found Dr. Baker negligent and also concluded this negligence proximately caused Burkhardt's injuries, awarding $237,500 in damages. The trial court, however, granted Dr. Baker's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), resulting in Burkhardt taking nothing. This decision prompted Burkhardt's appeal.

At trial, expert testimony supported the established standard of care, which dictated the removal of any internal fixation device in the presence of infection, barring the device's necessity for maintaining rigid bone fixation. The testimony of the experts, particularly Dr. Drew and Dr. Miller, highlighted the potential for an earlier cure of the infection and reduced complications had the device been promptly removed, as well as the extension of Burkhardt's suffering and the requirement for further surgeries due to the internal fixation device being left in place.","Given the ample and legally sufficient expert testimony presented at trial, which supported both the jury's findings of negligence and the proximate cause of Burkhardt's injuries being directly linked to that negligence, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's JNOV. The reasoning underlying this reversal will stress that the trial court's judgment is erroneous because substantial evidence of probative force exists, upon which the jury reasonably based its findings. The court will emphasize the congruence between the experts' opinions regarding the standard of care involving the treatment of osteomyelitis and the specifics of Burkhardt's situation.

The appellate court will likely reject the appellees' contentions that the evidence only suggests a possibility or conjecture regarding the proximate cause. Instead, the court will probably underscore the responsiveness and reliability of the expert testimony to questions of reasonable medical probability and its alignment with the jury's conclusions. Assertions that Burkhardt may have endured prolonged suffering even with the removal of the device are speculative and lack factual basis.

Additionally, the appellate court will most likely address the appellees' cross points of error, dismissing their arguments that the jury's determinations were not supported by factually sufficient evidence or against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Since Burkhardt adequately met his burden in establishing negligence and proximate cause through evidence, the court will find no merit in these cross points and overrule them.

Consequently, by rendering a detailed judgment on the jury verdict, the appellate court will conclude that Burkhardt is entitled to the $237,500 in damages awarded by the jury, reinstating the original verdict in his favor."
"The case involves appellant Border State Life Insurance Company and appellee Christine Noble regarding a policy of life insurance issued by the appellant on the life of the appellee's husband, Albert W. Noble, where the appellee was named as the beneficiary. Upon Mr. Noble's death, Mrs. Noble brought suit against the insurance company for the payment of life insurance proceeds.

The insurance company argued that the policy had lapsed due to the non-payment of an assessment premium due on August 5, 1937, and even though it was reinstated, Mr. Noble's coverage was limited by a ""good health"" clause which required him to be in good health upon reinstatement and not die from certain causes within one year of reinstatement. The company alleged they had mailed a notice of the assessment to Mr. Noble on July 20, 1937, but the payment was not made by August 5th, prompting a lapse in the policy.

However, Mrs. Noble claimed that her husband had not received the notice until August 9, 1937, to which he responded promptly. The policy on Mrs. Noble's life was similarly paid and accepted without any need for reinstatement. The company's policy and its Constitution and By-Laws had provisions stipulating the obligation to mail notice of assessments and the automatic lapse of the policy for failure to pay any assessment within fifteen days of notice. Additionally, if death occurred within one year from the reinstatement due to specified diseases, only a fraction of the policy amount was to be paid.

The jury found that the notice was mailed but not within the required fifteen days prior to the assessment due date, leading them to conclude that the policy did not lapse for non-payment. They also found that Mr. Noble was in good health at the time of reassessment and that neither heart disease nor kidney trouble, which were contributing causes, was the proximate cause of his death. The district court ruled in favor of Mrs. Noble, granting her the sum of $1,000, and the insurance company appealed the decision.","Based on the record, it was determined that the appellant, Border State Life Insurance Company, failed to provide timely notice of the premium assessment due on August 5 at least fifteen days prior to the due date. Therefore, there was no legitimate basis for claiming a lapse or suspension of Mr. Noble's life insurance policy. Despite appellant's argument that the policy was reinstated with limited coverage, the jury's findings indicated there was no legal lapse of the policy in the first place. The jury found that the notice of assessment was mailed but not within the stipulated timeframe, and they also found Mr. Noble to be in good health on the date of alleged reinstatement. Moreover, appellant's assertion of reduced payout due to death from specific diseases was rendered moot since there was no reinstatement in legal terms, and the decreased coverage contention did not stand.

Given these findings, the jury rejected the arguments for a decreased coverage and supported the continuation of the original policy terms, which were uncontestable after two years—a period that had already elapsed by the date of the assumed reinstatement. Furthermore, any conflicting jury findings regarding the cause of Mr. Noble's death from the eligible diseases were inconsequential since the underlying assumption of policy lapse was unsupported.

The prediction is that the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in all respects because the appellant did not fulfill its obligation to provide due and timely notice of the premium assessment in accordance with the insurance policy's terms. Consequently, the insurance policy remained in effect, entitling the appellee, Mrs. Noble, to the full life insurance proceeds without any limitations based on the ""good health"" clause or specified disease-related restrictions."
"The case involves an insured (appellee) who filed a lawsuit against his insurance company (appellant) following a dispute over damage claims. The appellee's water well was damaged by lightning, and upon contacting the insurer's agent, he was instructed to fix the well and submit the bill for reimbursement. The appellee carried out the repairs and presented the bill, but the insurer denied the claim, stating there was no definitive proof that lightning caused the well to fail. The appellee then filed suit to recover the damages under the insurance policy, claiming a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), which allows for treble damages in cases of deceptive practices. A jury verdict found in favor of the appellee, awarding him damages under the insurance policy, treble damages under the DTPA, plus attorney fees.

The case hinges on whether or not the appellee qualifies as a ""consumer"" as defined by the DTPA, based on the transactions between the appellee and the insurer's agent. The agent's instructions to fix the well and submit the bill for damages, which were later denied by the insurance company, form the basis of the appellee's claim for a DTPA violation. It is contested whether the agreement by the agent added to the liability of the insurance company under the policy and whether this constitutes a service or good acquired by purchase or lease, relevant to the “consumer” definition under the DTPA.","The court will affirm the trial court's decision partially, recognizing that the appellee is entitled to the damages awarded for the cost of repairs to his water well, which is covered by the insurance policy. This affirmation will be based on the jury's finding that the reasonable cost of repairs was $2,735 and the lack of specific error directed at the damages submission pertaining to the cost of repairs in the jury instruction.

However, the court will reverse the award for treble damages under the DTPA. Future analysis will focus on the definition of ""consumer"" within the DTPA, particularly Section 17.45 which specifies that a consumer must seek or acquire goods or services by purchase or lease. Since the agreement by the insurer's agent to pay the bill did not involve the appellee seeking or acquiring additional goods or services beyond the existing insurance policy, the court will likely find that the appellee does not fit within the statutory definition of a consumer with regard to the DTPA provision. Thus, even though the appellee suffered damages, those damages will not be multiplied under the DTPA as there were no deceptive practices involved with respect to the initial procurement of services or goods. Instead, the dispute arose from the implementation of the existing contract, which does not qualify him for additional protection or remedies under the DTPA.

As a result, while the costs of the water well repair will be upheld, no treble damages will be awarded for the alleged deceptive trade practices, and the appellee will take nothing for this part of his claim. 

Attorney fees will be adjusted, with the court significantly reducing the attorney fees awarded by the trial court, except for the $150 awarded on the Motion for Sanctions, which remains unchallenged. The costs of the appeal, having partially affirmed and partially reversed the trial court's judgment, will be divided equally between the parties."
"The appellants in this case are the family members of Florentino Rivera Sanchez, the decedent, who was killed in a vehicular collision on May 2, 1967. The decedent was attempting to turn left onto Linda Vista Street from East Houston Road, when his pickup truck was struck by an oil company tank truck driven by appellee Billings. The collision occurred at a high enough impact to carry both vehicles into a service station on the east side of the road, where a fire broke out and Sanchez suffered fatal burns.

The appellants filed a wrongful death action against Billings, claiming that he was negligent for driving over the posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour and that his negligence caused the collision. During the trial, the jury found that Billings was indeed traveling in excess of the speed limit but concluded that this was not the proximate cause of the accident. Instead, the jury determined the decedent's turning in front of Billings' truck, which was approaching close enough to constitute an immediate hazard, was the proximate cause of the accident.

The appellants challenged the judgment on several fronts, including the exclusion of habitual evidence regarding Billings' nicknames and prior speeding violations intended to establish that Billings' speeding was the sole proximate cause of the collision. They also disputed the jury's findings related to statutory and common law negligence, proximate cause, maintenance of a proper lookout, timely application of brakes, failure to turn to the left, and responses to special issues of contributory negligence. Additionally, they objected to the exclusion of testimony regarding ""normal"" turning distances and speeds, the alleged inability of the jury to use a microscope to examine tachograph charts, and other testimonies by expert witnesses.","The court will affirm the judgment of the lower court based on several key points. Firstly, they will uphold the necessity for appellants to prove not only negligence but also proximate cause, as required by Texas law. Given that the jury found that excessive speed was not the proximate cause of the accident, the appellants would fail to establish their cause of action.

Secondly, the court will find no abuse of discretion in excluding habit evidence, since the existence of an eyewitness made such evidence unnecessary and of minimal probative value. They will also rule that the exclusion of testimony about ""normal"" turning speeds and the usage of a microscope by the jury were within the discretion of the trial court and that any error in this regard would be harmless.

The court's reasoning will include determinations that the jury's verdict was not in great disregard of the preponderance of the evidence. Given that the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that Billings was operating his vehicle at a speed closer to, but not definitively above, the speed limit, they will argue the judgment was not against the weight and preponderance of the evidence.

Lastly, the court will dismiss the appellants' points of error challenging the jury’s finding on maintenance of a proper lookout, the application of the brakes, and failure to turn to the left, as well as objections on the submission of special issues regarding contributory negligence. The verdict will be supported by the testimony and evidence produced at trial, which will be considered sufficient for the jury to make a reasonable determination of the facts.

Overall, the court will support the jury’s findings that Billings was not negligent in a manner that proximately caused the collision and that the decedent's actions were the proximate cause of the accident. As such, the appellants' claims will not prevail, and the judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing will stand."
"State Representative James F. Hury participated in an air show in October 1992, piloting his own aircraft. Upon landing, his plane entered a ground loop, coming to a stop on a neighboring runway. Moments later, another plane landed and collided with Mr. Hury's stationary aircraft. Mr. Hury, who was still inside the aircraft, sustained substantial injuries which resulted in his death. Mr. Hury was insured under a life insurance policy issued by Group Life and Health Insurance Company, which was managed by the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas (the appellant). His widow, Linda Benge, received $171,000 in term life benefits and additionally sought accidental death benefits. The claim for accidental death benefits was denied by the insurer based on an aviation exclusion in the policy, and the Board upheld this denial after a hearing.

Linda Benge sought judicial review, and the District Court of Travis County found that Mr. Hury was engaged in air travel or flight at the time of death, but the court required the Board to determine that the excluded activity was the proximate cause of death before applying the exclusion and denying benefits. Consequently, the matter was remanded to the Board for a proximate cause determination. The Board and Group Life disagreed with the district court’s mandate for a separate proximate cause finding and sought judicial review, leading to this appeal. Additionally, by cross-appeal, Ms. Benge contended that Mr. Hury was not engaged in air travel or flight at the time of the accident, hence the policy exclusion should not apply.","The court's decision will be to reverse the district court's judgment that remanded the case for a proximate cause determination and to affirm the Board's order denying accidental death benefits. The court will conclude that the Board, possessing exclusive authority to interpret the language of the insurance policy, reasonably determined that Mr. Hury was engaged in air travel or flight as covered by the aviation exclusion at the time of his death. Furthermore, the court will find that this excluded activity – air travel or flight – was not remote in time or circumstance from the resultant accident and injury; thus, it was a direct cause rather than an indirect or remote cause, aligning with the interpretation that the activity need not be the sole proximate cause but rather a proximate cause of loss.

The court's reasoning will encompass the principle that the aviation exclusion is intended to encompass a continuum of risk associated with flight, inclusive of landing, temporary stopping, and taxiing on the runway until safe disembarkation. The notion of intermittent coverage based on the plane's movement, or lack thereof, will be considered an arbitrary interpretation against the clear intent of the policy. The court will emphasize that proximate causation in the context of insurance exclusions requires the excluded risk to be a direct cause of the loss, not merely a contributing factor, which is incidental or remote. The court will assert that the application of Stroburg v. Insurance Co. of North America to require the excluded activity to be the sole proximate cause of death is neither necessary nor appropriate under the given circumstances for aviation exclusions. The court's affirmation of the Board’s order will be based on substantial evidence supporting that air travel or flight led to Mr. Hury's injuries and death, which falls squarely under the policy's exclusionary terms."
"On March 10, 1970, William D. Brecheen Jr., a tank truck driver for Oil Transport Company, suffered injuries after being sprayed in the face with oil at Exxon's Baytown Refinery. Following the incident, he developed medical and psychological issues that had no previous history before the accident. He consulted with Dr. Larry B. Summers and Dr. James Peden, both of whom diagnosed him with severe mental illnesses like psychosis and schizophrenia deemed to be caused by the oil spraying incident.

Brecheen's condition led to erratic and unnatural behavior. Despite various treatments, there was no improvement in his mental health. On December 19, 1972, Brecheen committed suicide, leaving behind a coherent note for his wife, Sue Brecheen. After his death, Sue Brecheen filed a lawsuit under the Survival Statute, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 5525, and the Wrongful Death Act, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 4671, et seq.

The jury found Exxon guilty of negligence, which proximately caused both the oil spray incident and Brecheen's resultant mental illness and his death. The trial court awarded Sue Brecheen compensatory damages for hospital, medical, funeral charges, loss under Article 5525, compensation under Article 4671, and subrogation claims for Workmen's Compensation by Transport Insurance Company.

During the trial, the court excluded evidence of Sue Brecheen's ceremonial remarriage, a decision challenged by Exxon. Exxon presented three groups of points on appeal, including the exclusion of evidence regarding Brecheen's ceremonial remarriage and a release document signed by Brecheen upon entry to the refinery that purportedly released Exxon from liability.","The Court of Civil Appeals, and ultimately the Texas Supreme Court, reversed the trial court's judgment due to the exclusion of evidence of the ceremonial remarriage being deemed reversible error. The admissibility of evidence regarding Sue Brecheen's remarriage after her husband's death was mandated by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4675a, which became effective after Brecheen's death but before the trial.

The reversal is premised on the principle that the legislature's explicit instruction that evidence of a surviving spouse's ceremonial remarriage is admissible in wrongful death actions cannot be disregarded by the court. The court found that adjudicating the harmlessness of excluding such evidence would render the statute ineffectual, which would be contrary to the legislative intent and judicial duty to apply the law as declared by the legislature.

The Court also addressed Exxon's suicide defense argument, which contended that the suicide could not reasonably be anticipated as a result of the oil spray incident and that Brecheen may have committed suicide during a lucid interval. However, the court adopted the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 455, recognizing that a negligent act leading to insanity could render the actor liable for resulting self-harm during an uncontrollable impulse caused by that insanity. Nevertheless, the primary reason for reversal was the procedural error in excluding remarriage evidence, not the jury's findings on causation and negligence. The case was remanded for a new trial, allowing the evidence of Sue Brecheen's remarriage to be admitted."
"Petitioners, comprised of a driver, survivors, and passengers, initiated a legal action against respondents, the city, and both pursuing and assisting officers, after being involved in a high-speed chase that resulted in a vehicle collision. The case brought forth issues of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. The incident began when Mesquite police officers, employed as security guards at a truckstop, grew suspicious of a vehicle's occupants' activities, which they believed to be related to prostitution. The officers approached the car, driven by Stephen Adkins and occupied by Eric Lovell Wilson and Evelyn Anne Vestal, and instructed Adkins to wait in the front lot after checking his identification. Instead, Adkins sped off, and Officers Vestal Ashby and Johnny McClure gave chase while notifying the police department. Officers Jim Duckworth and Sam McDonald, in response to the radio call, attempted to intercept Adkins by traveling the correct direction on a one-way highway access road. As Adkins, followed by Ashby and McClure, drove the wrong way, he collided head-on with Brenda Travis' vehicle, killing Leonel Lozano and injuring Travis and other passengers.

The trial court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the city and officers, which was affirmed by the appellate court, leading the petitioners to seek review. The appellate court's decision rested on a finding that the police officers' decisions to initiate and continue the chase could not, as a matter of law, be considered a proximate cause of the accident, citing the case of Dent v. City of Dallas as precedent. However, depositions and evidence suggested that the officers acknowledged that a car chase could potentially lead to a head-on collision. The court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment for the responding officers who did not decide to initiate or continue the pursuit but reversed and remanded for Ashby, McClure, and the City of Mesquite. The officers’ motion for rehearing was overruled, and arguments of common-law immunity for government officials were not considered as they had not been expressly presented to the trial court.","The court is anticipated to reverse and remand the appellate court's judgment with regard to respondent city and respondent pursuing officers while upholding the summary judgment for respondent assisting officers. Expert legal analysis will likely interpret that the case presents fact issues, precluding summary judgment in favor of the pursuing officers and the city. This will be based on the proximate cause doctrine, which consists of two elements: cause in fact and foreseeability. It is expected that the court will reason that the officers' decision to initiate the high-speed chase was a substantial factor leading to the incident, suggesting 'cause in fact.' Additionally, given that the officers should have anticipated the dangers created by their pursuit, 'foreseeability' would also be established. The verdict should further reflect that, although the suspect’s flight constituted criminal conduct, this does not necessarily exempt the officers from liability if the suspect's actions were foreseeable as a result of the officers' negligence. The court will likely articulate that the statutory duty of police officers to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway underlines the potential liability of the officers. Their decision to give chase, given the dangerous conditions, was unreasonable and therefore could be deemed negligent.

Conversely, the court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of Officers McDonald and Duckworth, attributing their non-liability to their lack of involvement in the decision to partake in the chase, thereby not contributing to the cause of the accident. Essentially, the court should opine that their roles involved merely responding to the call for assistance rather than active participation in the chase's commencement or continuation.

In terms of the city's liability, the court's prediction will likely connect it to the liability of its officers; since there exist fact issues regarding the officers' negligence, so too does the city’s liability persist for further consideration. The court's judgment will expectedly be quite nuanced, accounting for the balance between enforcing laws and protecting public safety, and mindful of setting a precedent that accommodates the responsibilities of police officers without compromising the welfare of the community."
"On October 2, 1997, Dr. Mitchel Wong, a board-certified ophthalmologist affiliated with Austin Eye Clinic Association, conducted cataract surgery on George W. Graham's left eye. Postoperatively, Mr. Graham, a 73-year-old man at the time of trial, developed a series of complications that led to the complete loss of sensitivity to light in that eye. His subsequent treatment involving other physicians culminated in an additional surgery known as the ""Gunderson flap"" procedure, which he found disfiguring. The jury determined that the appellants' negligence proximately caused Mr. Graham's injury. They assessed damages for physical pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care at $200,000 for past damages and $462,500 for future damages; prejudgment interest increased the past damages to $248,690.53.

Following the surgery, Mr. Graham experienced substantial inflammation and decreased vision, eventually losing all light perception in the operated eye. Multiple medical experts testified on proximate cause and foreseeability, alleging Wong's failure to diagnose and treat either endophthalmitis or uveitis adequately – both possible postoperative conditions. Dr. Wong suggested Graham had non-infectious inflammation (uveitis), while independent experts proposed undiagnosed endophthalmitis, an infection requiring immediate intervention, as the cause of the vision loss. The evidence also critiqued the care provided by Wong, lack of appropriate testing, and insufficient chart documentation. Wong testified that he believed his treatment was appropriate, citing Graham's diminished likelihood of healing and the potential for pre-existing conditions contributing to the loss of vision.

The appellants raised issues concerning the use of evidence pertaining to an unrelated lawsuit involving Wong, sufficiency of the evidence for causation and damages, and the necessity of the damages awarded. Wong and the clinic argued that there was no clear segregation between damages caused by their care and other factors. However, sufficient evidence suggested that the Gunderson flap procedure, which resulted in Graham’s disfigurement, was the inevitable consequence of the appellant's treatment, and thus, appellants were held responsible for the resulting condition and disfigurement.","In affirming the judgment, it will be reasoned that appellee, George W. Graham, presented sufficiently detailed and compelling evidence proving both correctness and damages. The jury's decision is supported based on testimony from medical experts that Graham’s vision loss resulted from undiagnosed and inadequately treated endophthalmitis or, alternatively, uveitis. They posit that the appellants either failed to diagnose and treat the correct postoperative condition or properly manage Graham's persistent non-responsive uveitis, leading to his vision loss. The contention that Graham’s eye condition was worsened and his disfigurement resulted from long-term steroid eye drops used under Wong’s prescription will be supported. Further, it will be acknowledged that appellants did not sufficiently document Graham’s pain or effectively communicate his condition to subsequent doctors, exacerbating the persistence of his infection.

Additionally, it will be concluded that all damages suffered by George W. Graham were a direct result of appellants' treatment. Challenges to the award for damages for pain and mental anguish, impairment, disfigurement, and medical expenses will be dispelled based on the jury's prerogative to assess such compensations. Present and past evidence of Graham's significant physical and emotional pain, his functional impairments due to vision loss, and ongoing mental anguish will substantiate the jury's awards for both past and future damages. Any attempt by appellants to attribute the damages or their extent to factors other than their treatment will be dismissed as the evidence linking appellants’ negligence to the injuries and damages incurred by Graham is legally and factually sufficient. Thus, the judgment will be affirmed, upholding the significant award of over $700,000 in damages and prejudgment interest to Mr. Graham."
"The background of the case involves an 18-year-old deaf mute minor whose fingers were severely injured by a moving train belonging to the defendant railroad company while he was attempting to rescue a barrel that had rolled under it. The minor's mother brought a negligence lawsuit against the railroad company on behalf of her son, claiming that he was in the employ of the company without her consent. It was alleged that the young man was not instructed on the dangers of his work environment by the railroad company and that the company's agents and servants had invited him to work. In response, the railroad company pleaded contributory negligence, suggesting the minor was responsible for his injuries. During the trial, the jury was instructed that the burden was on the railroad company to prove that the minor had enough judgment and discretion to be chargeable with contributory negligence, and that the company was not required to warn the minor of the risk of the act he was attempting. The jury also was allowed to consider future pain and suffering in their assessment of damages. The railroad company appealed the judgment from the District Court of Navarro County (Texas) which had awarded the minor damages.","The court considered the evidence and the applicable law in rendering its decision regarding the claims of negligence and contributory negligence. They found that the trial court’s instructions regarding the burden of proof were erroneous; the defendant railroad company should not have had the burden to prove the minor's capacity for judgment and discretion placed upon them. The court analyzed the minor's age, knowledge, experience, and capacity to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for his own safety, noting that while he should be held accountable, his level of care was not necessarily equivalent to that expected of an adult.

The appeal court similarly found fault with the jury’s instruction regarding the failure to warn the minor. The court indicated that while the defendant had a duty to warn the minor of the dangers of loading and unloading freight if he was not capable of appreciating the risks due to his age, inexperience, infirmity, or lack thereof, the specific act of attempting to rescue the barrel under those given circumstances did not necessarily impose such a duty to warn on the defendant. Thus, it was for the jury to determine whether the minor’s act was within the scope of his duties, and whether a warning about the generic risks would have prevented him from attempting to rescue the barrel.

The court also disagreed with the district court's allowance for recovery for future pain and suffering, ruling that there was no evidence presented to suggest that the minor would suffer future pain and suffering from his injuries.

Therefore, due to the misinstructions to the jury about the defendant's burden and the issue of future pain and suffering, the verdict will reverse the judgment of the district court. The court would remand the case, implying that the district court would need to retry the case with the corrected legal standards and jury instructions, adequately addressing the issues raised on appeal regarding the instructions on the minor's employment status, his comprehension of danger, and the failure of the defendant to warn him of the risks. Additionally, the court would refuse to instruct the jury to allow damages for future pain and suffering unless there was substantial evidence to justify such a claim."
"The plaintiff, Iris Ramsey Brewer, sustained personal injuries after slipping and falling in an elevator due to a chili spill on its floor. The elevator was located in her apartment building. Brewer initiated a lawsuit against several parties including the Otis Elevator Company (defendant), which held a maintenance contract with the building's owner, Prudential Insurance Company of America. Otis's contractual obligation was to keep the elevators in proper repair.

The trial was taken to a jury, and the court instructed a verdict in favor of American Building Maintenance Company, Inc. After the jury returned their verdict, but before judgment was entered, the plaintiffs settled with Prudential for $3,000, and the plaintiffs filed a settlement agreement reflecting this amount along with an assignment from Prudential of its rights to indemnity or contribution from Otis.

The plaintiff argued that Otis had not only a contractual duty but also had undertaken active management and control of the elevators, imposing a high degree of care for the well-being and safety of passengers. It was alleged that Otis shared joint control over the elevators with Prudential. The case referenced Bond v. Otis Elevator Company, where joint control by both a building owner and Otis was acknowledged in a similar situation.

A core contention was regarding the lighting in the elevator, as Jury Special Issues 10, 11, and 12 addressed whether the lighting was as bright as it should have been under different care standards and whether that was a proximate cause of the fall. Additionally, Special Issue No. 20 considered if the conduct of Dolly Fulsom (who spilled the chili) was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's fall, which the Jury affirmed.

Evidence presented showed that before the elevator could be serviced for cleaning post-spill, Brewer attempted to enter it and consequently slipped and fell. The plaintiff's motion for judgment requested the court to rule in favor of the plaintiff against Otis for damages and for Prudential to receive indemnity from Otis.

Otis's contractual obligations outlined in the contract were considered, including exclusions regarding maintenance responsibilities, especially related to safety tests, new attachments, and negligence or misuse beyond their control.","The court is expected to affirm the decision entering judgment for the defendant, Otis Elevator Company, in the plaintiff tenant's personal injury action. The reasoning would be that Otis's duty was limited to maintaining the elevators in good mechanical condition rather than cleaning spills or safety checks regarding the lighting in the elevators.

The verdict would state that the contract between Prudential and Otis did not place the responsibility for the design of the elevator's lighting system on Otis, nor did the contract require Otis to ensure the cleanliness of the elevator interiors. Given that the spill did not represent a mechanical condition, Otis is not liable for the slip and fall that occurred due to the chili spill.

Furthermore, the court would likely clarify the distinctions between different standards of care. Even though the plaintiff argued for a high degree of care similar to that required for common carriers, Otis's duty would be considered to exercise only ordinary care in maintenance, not to ensure the well-being and safety of elevator passengers at the higher standard.

Since the plaintiff did not appeal the judgment regarding Prudential and American, and no new motion for the trial was filed, the court would rely on the jury's findings and the established scope of Otis's contractual duties. Therefore, the trial court would have correctly declined to award damages, indemnity, or contribution against Otis. The affirmation of the trial court's judgment would be based on the legal interpretation of the maintenance contract and the absence of findings to implicate Otis in a breach of duty that could have prevented the accident."
"The case concerns a medical malpractice lawsuit filed by the appellee (patient) against the appellant (physician). The patient claimed that in January 1923, due to a runaway accident, they sustained severe injuries, including a bruised and dislocated arm, a bruised and broken collar bone, and a broken jawbone. The patient alleged intense bodily pain and hired the appellant physician to diagnose and treat these injuries. However, the patient accused the physician of carelessly failing to diagnose and treat the injuries properly, which constituted malpractice resulting in the patient suffering further harm.

The physician refuted the claims, arguing that if the patient suffered any injury and pain as a result of the accident, it was due to the patient's own actions, including not permitting a thorough examination by the physician and not following instructions regarding exercising the injured limb and seeking further treatment, including an X-ray examination.

During the trial, the court sustained certain special exceptions and overruled general demurrers, ultimately leading to a verdict in favor of the patient. The jury awarded the patient $1,250 in damages with interest. The appellant's motion for a new trial was overruled, leading to an appeal. 

The appeal discussed several points, including: whether it was error to permit the patient to testify about the permanency of the injuries, the admissibility and qualifications of an expert witness, Dr. Williams, and the jury's verdict based on the extent of the injuries and physician's care standard. Furthermore, the definition of proximate cause provided to the jury, which omitted the element of foreseeability as a necessary component, was questioned as a significant point of error that might require reversal of the judgment.","The appellate court will focus on the error made by the trial court in its jury instruction regarding the definition of proximate cause. Since proximate cause was a material issue in this case, the omission of foreseeability or anticipation of injury as an essential element was a significant oversight. Even though the appellant did not request a special charge correcting this definition after objecting to the original charge, recent precedent (e.g., Conley Case) has established that it is unnecessary to request a special charge to preserve the objection to an incorrect jury instruction.

The appellate court will likely recognize that the trial court's definition could have misled the jury regarding the necessary conditions for establishing the appellant's negligence as the proximate cause of the patient's injuries. As a result, the appellate court will reverse the judgment in favor of the patient and remand the case for a new trial, ensuring that the jury is adequately instructed on all aspects of proximate cause, including the requirement of foreseeability. The appellate court's decision will underscore that proper jury instruction is crucial for a fair trial, especially on pivotal legal concepts like proximate cause that underpin a malpractice lawsuit's outcome.

"The case involves a buyer (plaintiff) suing the seller (defendant) for damages related to the sale and delivery of diseased cattle, which introduced Bang's disease to the buyer's previously healthy herd. According to the case, the defendant sold cattle to the plaintiff, which were infected with Bang's disease at the time of delivery. As a result, the disease spread to the cattle already owned by the plaintiff. The seller argued that some damages were caused by the condition of the buyer's premises, which purportedly harbored and facilitated the spread of the disease. However, the jury determined that the buyer's premises and cattle were free from disease until the infected cattle were delivered.

The original trial court's judgment favored the buyer and awarded damages based on the difference between the reasonable cash market value of the infected cows at the time of delivery and the price the buyer paid for the cows. Thus, the buyer was awarded $1,750 in damages. The seller submitted a special issue questioning if the seller's cows had Bang's disease and whether the buyer's cows were free from the disease before the purchase. The trial court, however, did not submit these issues to the jury as they were considered evidentiary toward the outcome, which was already determined.

The seller moved for a rehearing, arguing that the damages were not wholly proximately caused by the seller's fraud due to the plaintiff's premises contributing to the spread of Bang's disease. The seller maintained that without clarity on the proximate causes of damage, the buyer could not recover any damages, and therefore, the seller was entitled to judgment. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that since the disease was introduced by and spread from the defendant's cattle, all damages were proximately caused by the seller's fraud.","The court will overrule the motion for rehearing. Because the jury already ascertained the reasonable cash market value of the cows delivered by the seller as being $1,750—due to being infected with Bang's disease—the plaintiff will be entitled to the difference between this sum and what he paid for the cows, irrespective of other damages resulting from the spread of the disease. The argument that the plaintiff failed to show that all damage was proximately caused by the defendant's fraud will not be upheld due to the earlier jury finding that all the damage was proximately caused by the seller's fraudulent sale of diseased cattle. The seller's contention that a portion of the damages was due to the condition of the plaintiff's premises, which harbored the disease, will not relieve the seller from liability because it would be irrelevant unless the disease was already present, which was not the case.

The court will adhere to the notion that there may be multiple proximate causes for damages and that the initial introduction of the disease by the seller's cattle was a proximate cause for the harm to the buyer's herd. This means even if the condition of the buyer's premises contributed to the spread of the disease, it does not detract from the causative effect of the infected cattle sold by the seller. Moreover, the seller's effort to argue that the plaintiff owed a duty to exercise care to prevent or minimize damage will not be persuasive because it was the defendant's original fraudulent act that set forth the chain of events leading to damage.

In conclusion, the court will consider the plaintiff's lack of knowledge about the disease prior to the cattle sale and the defendant's full awareness and misrepresentation as primary in determining that the seller's actions were the proximate cause of the buyer's damages. The judgment rendered will support the buyer's entitlement to damages, and the seller's contentions raised in the motion for rehearing will be deemed without merit. Thus, the seller's motion for rehearing will be respectfully overruled."
"William David Golden was charged with possession of a controlled substance, represented himself pro se initially, and then had attorney Donald Ray McNeal and investigator Shirley Alfred Johnson appointed to assist with his criminal defense. Following his conviction and the exhaustion of the appeals process, which included the affirmation of his conviction by the Texas Court of Appeals, refusal of his petition for discretionary review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, and denial of his petition for writ of certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court, Golden received a forty-year prison sentence. 

After his appeals were completed, Golden sued McNeal and Johnson on the grounds of professional malpractice, negligence, violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. Most of Golden's claims alleged that McNeal failed to properly object, question witnesses, or argue certain issues during trial. Golden's grievances against Johnson were primarily focused on her alleged failure to locate potential character witnesses. There were extended difficulties with service of process, particularly with respect to McNeal.

Both defendants argued that any damages claimed by Golden were solely due to his own criminal conduct. Additionally, they contended Golden's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, and McNeal also argued that Golden lacked diligence in serving process. Summary judgment was granted separately in favor of Johnson, labeled ""Partial Summary Judgment,"" and McNeal, labeled ""Final Judgment.""

On appeal, Golden contended that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment, failed to address the issue of service of process, refused to file findings of fact and conclusions of law, declined to hold a hearing on the motion for new trial, and did not act on the motion to disqualify the visiting judge.","In reviewing the case, the appellate court would likely determine that Golden could not sue investigator Johnson for her conduct during his criminal defense because the proximate cause of any damages resulting from his conviction was his own criminal behavior, consistent with precedent from the Peeler case. As Golden did not develop any breach of contract claims specifically against Johnson, and she did not have a fiduciary duty to him, it would be anticipated that Johnson's summary judgment would remain upheld. The appellate court would not find any breach of contract or fiduciary duty claims against Johnson in Golden's petition.

Concerning Golden's action against attorney McNeal, it is predicted that the appellate court would find that the lawsuit was not time-barred by the statute of limitations because the timeframe would be tolled until all of Golden's rights of action in his criminal appeal had been exhausted. With McNeal acknowledging that he had filed an answer in the case, the appellate court would deduce that the requirement for serving a citation upon him was rendered moot, thereby indicating that the summary judgment in favor of McNeal was erroneously granted.

In addressing the remaining issues raised by Golden, it would be established that findings of fact and conclusions of law are not applicable in summary judgment proceedings. Concerning the refusal to hold a hearing on the motion for new trial, courts generally do not have an obligation to hold a hearing when motions are overruled by operation of law. Lastly, since there was no evidence of any timely objection or motion to disqualify the visiting judge, it would be deduced that there was no error on this matter by the trial court.

Thus, the appellate court would reverse the summary judgment granted to attorney McNeal, remand that portion of the judgment for further proceedings, and affirm the judgment in other respects—particularly the summary judgment granted to investigator Johnson."
"On May 31, 2016, a construction worker named Jose Camerino Maravilla was electrocuted and his coworker, John Paniagua, was injured while they were working on a home being constructed by Weekley Homes, LLC. Paniagua and Maravilla’s relatives (referred to collectively as ""appellants"") filed a lawsuit against Weekley and others, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and premises liability. The contention was that they were storing scaffolding on a wet concrete floor during a storm which led to their electrocution. The appellants claimed there were no warnings about the energized temporary power poles and lines that could cause the surface area to become energized due to nearby electrical poles.

Weekley Homes filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because Paniagua and Maravilla were employees of an independent contractor hired for framing and cornice work, Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code applied, thus absolving Weekley from liability unless certain conditions were met. Weekley claimed that they had no control over the manner in which work was performed and lacked knowledge of any dangerous condition.

Appellants contended that Weekley knew about the dangerous weather conditions and should not have told workers to move the scaffolding during the rain. They put forth that there was actual exercise of control by Weekley over the work conditions, as evidenced by instructions given by Weekley's representative on the site, Mr. Holmes.

The trial court initially granted Weekley’s motion for summary judgment, and subsequently, denials were made for appellants' motions for reconsideration and new trial, and for leave to designate experts late.","In evaluating the applicability of Chapter 95, even if all legal procedures were followed with the declarations, there's no definitive proof that the injuries originated from working on the very same improvement as stated under the Chapter. Hence, Weekley did not conclusively show that the Chapter 95 protections were applicable. Consequently, the trial court's granting of the traditional summary judgment based on Chapter 95 was erroneous.

Regarding the no-evidence summary judgment for negligence and premises liability claims, appellants presented more than a scintilla of evidence demonstrating a duty owed and the possibility of a nexus between their injuries and the control of their working conditions by Weekley. This includes Mr. Holmes's selection of the metal scaffolding, and his instruction to continue work through bad weather. Additionally, Longeway’s expert report provides crucial and new facts, which were not previously available or discoverable before the trial court's ruling, and is likely to produce a different result upon retrial. Consequently, the denial of appellants’ motion for reconsideration and new trial concerning negligence and premises liability claims was an abuse of discretion by the trial court.

However, appellants failed to provide substantive evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Weekley's actual, subjective awareness of risk—a required element for a gross negligence claim. Therefore, the trial court was correct in denying the motion for reconsideration and new trial in relation to the gross negligence claim.

Ultimately, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s verdict on the gross negligence claim, reversed the verdict on the negligence and premises liability claims, and remanded those parts back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion."
"Shelly Fennern, a 47-year-old woman, underwent elective colon resection surgery on March 28, 2007, at Shannon Medical Center in San Angelo, Texas. She experienced an anastomotic leak from the surgery. A CT scan performed on April 9 revealed the leak, and Fennern subsequently had a second surgery to correct the issue. Post-operatively, Fennern developed increasing tachycardia and hypoxemia and reported shortness of breath. Although initially improving and being removed from the ventilator on April 20, Fennern became unresponsive on April 23, was resuscitated, but eventually died later that morning after her family requested the removal of vasopressor agents. 

Jeffrey Fennern and Farah Fennern, the appellants, filed a medical negligence suit against Dr. William Whitehead, the appellee and treating physician, alleging that Whitehead's failure to diagnose the anastomotic leak until April 9 represented a breach of the applicable standard of care, and that this delay was a proximate cause of Fennern's death. They relied on the testimony of Dr. Brian Camazine, an expert witness, who opined that a delay in diagnosis led to conditions like peritonitis, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which ultimately resulted in Fennern's death due to either pulmonary embolus or cardiac arrhythmia.

The district court granted Whitehead's motion to exclude Dr. Camazine's testimony, finding it to be speculative and unreliable. Consequently, the court also granted Whitehead's no-evidence motion for summary judgment, as a result of which a take-nothing judgment was entered against the appellants. The appellants challenged the exclusion of the expert testimony on appeal, contending that Dr. Camazine's opinions were reliable and based on his extensive experience, published medical literature, and general medical knowledge.

Whitehead's motion to exclude was partly based on the argument that Dr. Camazine's testimony lacked a reliable foundation and was grounded in speculation, not scientific evidence. During proceedings, Dr. Camazine acknowledged he had not reviewed medical literature to support his opinions specifically and that the articles he later provided did not support the critical delay period (from day 8 to day 12 after the initial surgery) he argued was a substantial factor in Fennern's death.","The appellate court will affirm the judgment of the district court. The reasoning will focus on the reliability standards for expert witness testimony, consistent with the precedents set by cases such as Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. The court will rule that the expert testimony provided by Dr. Camazine was rightly excluded because it was not sufficiently grounded in scientific methods and procedures. Dr. Camazine's opinion was deemed to lack a proper basis as he had not conducted a thorough literature review to underpin his conclusions, and the medical articles presented did not specifically support the significance of the four-day delay in the diagnosis of Fennern's condition, nor did they establish a direct link between the delay and her death.

Furthermore, they will determine there is an analytical gap between the data available and the opinion proffered by Dr. Camazine. His assertions about the potential causes of Fennern's death were speculative, as they were based on probability and possible increased risk, rather than a direct causal link established with reasonable medical certainty. Consequently, Whitehead's actions or omissions cannot be considered a substantial factor in Fennern's death, insufficient to meet the legal standard for proximate cause required to demonstrate medical negligence. This conclusion leads the court to affirm the district court's grant of no-evidence motion for summary judgment in Whitehead's favor since, without the expert testimony, the appellants lacked evidence to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence and Fennern's death. The appellate court will base its affirmation on the need for expert opinions to be more than mere speculation and to demonstrate a reliable, causal connection to the alleged harm based on reasonable medical probability."
"Coastal Tankships U.S.A., Inc. (Coastal) is the appellant in this case, appealing from a jury verdict that awarded damages to the appellee, Florence Anderson, administratrix of the estate of Morris Anderson. Coastal owned and operated the steam tanker S.S. COASTAL MANATEE, which was used to transport chemical naphtha. Morris Anderson was a utility hand aboard this vessel and was exposed to naphtha fumes that led to his illness and subsequent diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Morris Anderson had no preexisting chronic illnesses or respiratory problems, had never smoked, and had been physically active. He passed a health examination before joining the crew of the tanker. During a voyage, on two occasions, the tanker loaded naphtha and carried it for approximately 11 days, during which crew members smelled strong chemical fumes. Anderson began experiencing headaches, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, shoulder stiffness, and tightness in his chest. His condition worsened over time, and he was eventually taken ashore for medical attention.

Florence Anderson as the administratrix filed a personal injury suit alleging negligence under the Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritime law. At trial, a videotaped deposition testimony of Dr. Miller, Anderson's sole testifying expert on medical causation, was introduced into evidence over Coastal's objection. Dr. Miller testified that Anderson's exposure to naphtha caused his BOOP, based on his differential diagnosis. Coastal's objection centered on the argument that sufficient medical causation evidence was lacking and that Dr. Miller's methodology was unreliable. Coastal also argued that Dr. Miller's opinions, which were based on an assumption (specific causation), could not adequately establish general causation that naphtha exposure can cause BOOP.","The court decided that Anderson's medical expert, Dr. Miller's testimony on causation, was not reliable. Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis was found to be an insufficient method to establish both specific and general causation under the Daubert/Robinson/Jordan reliability test. Specifically, the differential diagnosis assumed but did not establish that naphtha could be a general cause of BOOP. Therefore, this diagnosis could only at best show specific causation and not general causation which is necessary for one to be held liable in a toxic-tort suit.

The appellate court determined that there was no substantial evidence to prove that naphtha exposure could generally cause BOOP. The trial court had therefore abused its discretion by admitting Dr. Miller's testimony as it was based on a differential diagnosis that did not sufficiency establish the causation required under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 and the applicable case law. The court concluded that without Dr. Miller's causation testimony, which the court deemed inadmissible, there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that naphtha exposure had any role, even the slightest, in causing Anderson’s BOOP. As such, the judgment awarding damages to Anderson administratrix was reversed and rendered in favor of Coastal."
"Dennis Rayner, a long-haul truck driver with over thirty years of experience, was employed by Joe Tex Xpress, Inc. (Joe Tex). On July 23, 2010, Rayner was involved in a collision with Krista Dillon's Chevy Malibu while driving on Interstate Highway 30. Rayner changed lanes and struck Dillon's car from the rear, causing it to spin into the median. Dillon refused medical care at the scene but subsequently sought treatment for injuries and underwent surgeries. Dillon sued Rayner and his employer, Joe Tex, for personal injuries, eventually being awarded more than $1 million in actual damages and exemplary damages against Rayner and Joe Tex.

Evidence showed that Rayner had a history of falsifying his driver's log books, failing to submit required logs, and had driving schedule irregularities leading to questions about driver fatigue on the day of the incident. Rayner had previously been cited for nine DOT (Department of Transportation) violations for excessive driving hours and failed to submit thirteen driving logs in the month before the accident. There was also evidence of log-book violations on the date of the accident.

There had been a DOT audit of Joe Tex in April 2010, which resulted in lowering their safety rating due to safety-related violations, many of which were critical. Joe Tex's president, Joe Setina, admitted to being aware of Rayner’s log book falsifications before the accident and recognized that over-hour driving could result in driver fatigue, potentially leading to catastrophic accidents. Despite Joe Tex's policy stating that a driver's employment would be terminated after a fourth log book violation within thirty days, Rayner kept his job without any disciplinary action taken against him.

The gross negligence finding revolved around whether Rayner and Joe Tex were aware of the risks of driver fatigue and proceeded with conscious indifference to the safety of others, thus constituting gross negligence under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.001(11)(A), (B).","The evidence supported the jury's finding of gross negligence against Rayner as he could not assert he was not fatigued on the day of the accident, did not see Dillon's car before the accident, hit her car from behind, and had a pattern of log book violations indicating driving excessive hours, reflecting a conscious indifference to the risks associated with driving while potentially fatigued given his extensive driving experience.

Similarly, the evidence substantiated the jury's finding of gross negligence against Joe Tex. Setina was acutely aware of Rayner’s long history of over-hour violations, which he acknowledged made a driver unsafe, well before the accident occurred. No adverse action was taken against Rayner, even though company policy required termination after multiple violations. Overall, Joe Tex's lax approach, despite awareness of the dangerous pattern, indicated that the company knowingly allowed Rayner to drive potentially fatigued, maintaining a practice that disregarded the safety of other motorists.

Therefore, both the objective and subjective components of gross negligence defined by statute were met by clear and convincing evidence. The jury could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction that both Rayner and Joe Tex's conduct was grossly negligent, which led to the harm experienced by Dillon. As such, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of Dillon against Rayner and Joe Tex."
"James and Joyce Driskill's 1993 Lincoln Town Car caught fire in 2003 while parked in their garage, resulting in the destruction of their home and personal belongings. Investigations determined that the fire originated in the left rear area of the car's engine compartment. The Driskills filed a products liability lawsuit in Van Zandt County, Texas, against Ford Motor Company and Sensata Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as Texas Instruments, Inc.), who were involved in the creation of the car. The crux of the Driskills' claims centered around the allegation that a defect in the speed control deactivation switch (SCDS) was responsible for causing the fire.

During the legal proceedings, the trial court excluded in part the testimony of the Driskills' expert witness concerning the causation of the fire, although the testimony about the location of the fire's origin remained. The expert witness attested that the fire had begun in the indicated area of the engine compartment. Despite this, the court granted summary judgments in favor of Ford and Sensata after concluding that the Driskills failed to bridge the analytical gap between the fire's origin and the defective SCDS as the cause-in-fact.

It was noted that before the fire, the car's cruise control had become inoperative, and the SCDS itself was found ""burned and melted beyond recognition."" However, no definitive link was established by expert testimony that directly tied the malfunctioning SCDS to the ignition of the fire. Ford and Sensata filed no-evidence motions for summary judgment, claiming there was no evidence of the necessary proximate cause to support the Driskills' claims. Furthermore, the Driskills did not preserve their argument regarding the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur for appellate review, having not raised the issue in their response to the motions for summary judgment.","The Appeals Court will uphold the decision of the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of Ford and Sensata due to multiple reasons. Firstly, Ford’s and Sensata’s motions for summary judgment will be found to comply with Rule 166a(i) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule relates to no-evidence summary judgments, and the court will likely conclude that while the manufacturers did not list every element of the causes of action, they did pinpoint the absence of evidence regarding cause-in-fact, a crucial element required to be proven by the Driskills. 

Secondly, the absence of evidence of proximate cause will be a determining factor. Due to the complexity of establishing causation in a products liability action centered around sophisticated products—where the issues are beyond the general knowledge of laypersons—expert testimony was critical. The Appeals Court will find that the Driskills failed to provide more than a mere suspicion that the SCDS was the cause-in-fact of the fire which would necessitate bridging the analytical gap with more substantial evidence provided by a qualified expert, as per pertinent Texas law and precedents such as Tamez and Nissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong.

Lastly, the Appeals Court will not consider the res ipsa loquitur argument as it was not preserved for appeal. The Driskills' failure to raise this issue in their initial response to the summary judgment motions will be viewed as a forfeiture of the right to rely on this doctrine on appeal.

Based on the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed by the Appeals Court, thereby dismissing the Driskills' suit against the manufacturers due to insufficient proof of proximate causation and procedurally unpreserved arguments."
"The appellants, Donna and Don Basinger, brought a medical negligence action against Covenant Health System, doing business as Covenant Medical Center Lakeside, after Donna Basinger underwent colon surgery. The Basingers alleged that the nursing staff at the medical center failed to properly monitor and maintain a nasogastric tube that was inserted into Donna Basinger postoperatively. They claimed that this failure led to the aspiration of stomach fluids into Donna's lungs, resulting in pneumonia and decreased pulmonary function. Additionally, they asserted that the reduced oxygen level in her blood caused impairment of her memory and psychological injuries from the emotional trauma. Don Basinger also claimed loss of consortium and related damages.

After the discovery process, Covenant Health System filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. They argued that the Basingers had no evidence to establish that Donna's pneumonia was caused by an improperly functioning nasogastric tube, no evidence of a permanent or chronic reduction in her pulmonary function due to the pneumonia, and no evidence that the pneumonia caused injury to her mental capacity. The trial court found that the Basingers failed to produce evidence of causation and granted the take-nothing summary judgment in favor of Covenant Health System.

The Basingers challenged the summary judgment on appeal, putting forward four issues. They contended that the motion for summary judgment was conclusory and violated Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, they argued that the deposition testimony of their experts provided sufficient evidence of causation to defeat the no-evidence motion.

For causation evidence, the Basingers presented deposition testimony from Lisa DeHoyos Hogan, a registered nurse. Although Hogan admitted she was not qualified to make a medical diagnosis such as a diagnosis of pneumonia, she referred to the medical record where physicians noted that Donna Basinger had likely aspirated due to a malfunctioning nasogastric tube. Hogan highlighted a note made by Dr. Justin McCarthy listing pneumonia as a probable result of aspiration caused by a blocked and malpositioned tube, and a note by Dr. Kenneth Terrell stating, ""I think she probably aspirated."" However, neither statement explicitly attributed the aspiration to a malfunctioning nasogastric tube.

Additionally, the Basingers referenced the testimony of Dr. Robert Packard, a neurologist who evaluated Donna years after her hospitalization. However, he could not state with reasonable medical probability that her injuries were a result of lack of oxygen from the time at Covenant.","The court ruled in favor of Covenant based on the lack of expert medical testimony establishing causation to a reasonable medical probability. The court held that the summary judgment record did not contain an expert medical opinion linking Donna Basinger's pneumonia to an improperly functioning nasogastric tube. Specifically, while Dr. McCarthy's and Dr. Terrell's notes indicated that Donna probably aspirated, neither note made an explicit connection between the aspiration and the nursing staff's management of the nasogastric tube. Their statements did not satisfy the requirement of establishing cause in fact and foreseeability as components of proximate cause.

Further, the absence of expert testimony establishing a causal connection between the pneumonia and any impairment of memory was another key reason for the verdict. Dr. Packard's inability to affirm that her injuries were due to her hospitalization at Covenant meant there was no expert testimony to support a link between Donna's condition and the alleged medical negligence. The appellate court would agree with the trial court's findings that the Basingers did not demonstrate that any act or omission by Covenant Health System was the proximate cause necessary for a claim in medical negligence. As such, it will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment, ruling that the Basingers take nothing against Covenant."
"William A. Smoak was injured in a collision with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer rig operated by Pilgrim's Pride Corporation employee Paul Dixon Link. The accident occurred when Smoak, driving westbound on Watson Boulevard, was making a right turn onto Broadnax Street, Daingerfield, via a merge lane from Watson onto Broadnax. At that moment, Link, driving eastbound on Watson, executed a left turn onto Broadnax and moved directly into Smoak's merge lane, causing a collision. The collision resulted in a back injury to Smoak that required surgery.

Smoak sued Pilgrim's Pride and Link, alleging negligence. At trial, a jury found that Pilgrim's Pride and Link were seventy-five percent at fault, while Smoak was twenty-five percent at fault. Smoak was awarded various damages, including $50,000 for past physical pain and mental anguish; $25,000 for future pain and anguish; $37,500 for past loss of earning capacity; $200,000 for future loss of earning capacity; $100,000 for past physical impairment; $100,000 for future physical impairment; $91,103.93 for past medical care; and $25,000 for future medical care. Additionally, $3,989.28 was awarded in stipulated property damage. The court applied prejudgment interest, resulting in a total award of $632,761.49.

Pilgrim's Pride appealed, contesting several points, including the admissibility and evidentiary value of the testimony from the investigating officer regarding negligence determination and the testimony of Smoak's economic expert concerning the loss of future earning capacity. Pilgrim's Pride contested that there was no or insufficient evidence on causation, lost earnings, and a need for future medical care to sustain the judgment.","The appellate court will find that the policeman who investigated the accident, Ronald Penny, was neither qualified nor lacking proper credentials as an accident reconstruction expert to give an expert opinion on the negligence that caused the accident. However, his general observations made at the scene will be deemed admissible, as they are rational and helpful for understanding his testimony and determining the cause of the accident. The court will view Penny's deterministic opinion on who caused the accident as not meeting the requirement for admissible expert testimony but will nonetheless consider his observations and heeding the testimony of other witnesses about the collision.

The court will uphold Smoak's economic expert, Dale Funderburk's, testimony and calculations regarding Smoak's post-accident wage earning capacity, accepting that Funderburk applied consistent methodology to determine Smoak's future loss of earning capacity and that the expert's alterations to post-accident wages did not materially change his methodology or results.

The court will also reverse the part of the judgment that awarded Smoak future medical expenses, concluding that no evidence was presented showing a reasonable probability that Smoak would need future medical treatment, as the evidence only indicated mere possibility or speculation without a showing of likely medical expenses above a fifty percent chance.

In all other aspects, the judgment from the trial court will be affirmed. Smoak's provided evidence, including the testimony regarding the diminished capacity to work even after surgery and the fiscal impacts experienced, is sufficient to affirm the jury's findings of past and future loss of earning capacity. The role of the jurors' discretion becomes crucial in the context of uncertainty surrounding earning capacity from the injury sustained and subsequent medical treatment. Thus, the court will determine that the criteria for legal and factual sufficiency have been met for the affirmed parts of the judgment, given the peculiarity of the facts and the evidence at trial."
"Curtis Chesser, a Fort Worth Police Officer, suffered a mild stroke affecting his swallowing ability. Initially treated at Huguley Hospital and Granbury Hospital, he was subsequently transferred to the LifeCare Hospital of Fort Worth (Hospital), a long-term acute care facility managed by LifeCare Management Services, L.L.C. (LMS), for rehabilitation and therapy. While at Hospital, Chesser was treated by Drs. Ade Adedokun, Edward Ferree, and Burke DeLange.

Several days after his admission, Dr. DeLange, along with nurses Carol Smith and Cindy Barnett, performed a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion through his abdominal wall into his stomach. Post-insertion, Chesser reported severe abdominal pain, rating it at 10 on a scale of 1-10. His condition deteriorated over the next four days, as his complaints and their cause went unaddressed. Chesser requested a transfer to a full-service hospital after he excreted a significant amount of blood and his blood pressure dropped dangerously low. He was transferred to Harris Hospital, where an endoscopy revealed a large ulcer on his stomach lining, blood in his stomach, active bleeding from the epigastric artery, and resulted in a cardiopulmonary arrest along with sustained permanent cognitive deficits. Chesser received outpatient brain injury services thereafter and continued to require various health care treatments and services.

Chesser, through his spouse and power of attorney, Ava Chesser, filed a health care liability suit against Appellees LMS and the Hospital. He also asserted negligence against the three doctors, who settled before trial. The case went to a jury trial in the 236th District Court of Tarrant County, Texas.

During the trial, it was revealed that no policies or procedures had been devised for post-PEG insertion patients, leading to Chesser's condition going unchecked. There were no expert testimonies provided concerning the standard of care for the three settling doctors, any breach of that standard of care, or that any such breach was a proximate cause of Chesser's damages. Despite this, the trial court submitted the issue of the settling doctors' negligence to the jury to apportion damages, should liability be found, under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 33.003(b) (2008).

Other key points included evidence that no nursing plan was devised for Chesser, resulting in his decline; the settling defendants paid $183,000 in damages and $48,334 in costs to settle Chesser's claims against them, and before trial, Appellees elected the percentage settlement credit; the jury awarded a total responsibility percentage of 10% to the settling defendants, and the trial court's judgment applied a settlement credit of $377,383.53.

Additionally, the jury found a joint enterprise between LMS and Hospital, attributing 30% responsibility to LMS and 60% to the Hospital, and accordingly imposed joint and several liability on them in the final judgment. This finding carried implications for the applicability of statutory caps on noneconomic damages and the responsibilities of LMS and Hospital to pay for those damages.","The appellate court will determine that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of the negligence of the three doctors who settled to the jury for the purpose of apportioning damages. This mistake is due to the lack of legally sufficient evidence of their negligence, specifically the absence of expert testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to those doctors, evidence of any breach of such a standard of care, and evidence that any such breach was a proximate cause of Chesser's damages. The appellate court will consequently hold that the issue regarding the settling doctors' percentage of responsibility should not have been submitted, and no percent of responsibility should have been attributed to them by the jury. As a result, the percentage-of-responsibility settlement credit elected by the Appellees will be deemed erroneously applied, and the court will modify the judgment to reflect a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit of $183,000 instead of the previously applied 10% settlement credit of $377,383.53.

Additionally, the appellate court will find there is no evidence of a community of pecuniary interest in the common purpose of the enterprise between LMS and Hospital, rendering evidence legally insufficient to support the jury's finding of a joint enterprise. Therefore, LMS will not be jointly and severally liable for the entire judgment but only 30% responsible as found by the jury. This will also modify the judgment to reflect that Hospital and LMS are each severally liable for $250,000 in noneconomic damages, reflecting the statutory cap per the civil practices and remedies code. 

Regarding the award for prejudgment interest on past noneconomic damages, the appellate court will hold that prejudgment interest is not included in the statutory limit set forth in section 74.301 of the civil practice and remedies code and does not constitute a form of noneconomic damages but rather pecuniary loss for the loss of the use of money. Therefore, the court will affirm the awarding of prejudgment interest as not conflicting with the relevant statutes.

Lastly, the court will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when ordering a specific annuity to fund periodic payments for Chesser’s future medical expenses since it was backed by legislation permitting the arrangement and was not contested at the lower court level by Appellees. The judgment will remain affirmed for the areas not modified or reversed."
"Andrea and Lawrence Ruiz owned a 2002 Kia Spectra. On January 16, 2006, Andrea was driving with her daughter Suzanna as the front-seat passenger, both wearing seat belts, when they were involved in a head-on collision with a truck driven by Harvey Tomlin. While Suzanna's air bag deployed causing minor injuries, Andrea's did not, ultimately leading to her death at the scene from severe neck injuries. The Ruiz family sued Kia Motors Corporation and Kia Motors America, Inc. (collectively, Kia) claiming that the air-bag system was defectively designed, specifically faulty wiring connectors, leading to the failure of Andrea's air bag to deploy during the collision.

The jury found that Kia's negligence in the design of the vehicle's air-bag system was a proximate cause of Andrea's injury, with responsibility for the injury apportioned 45% to Kia and 55% to Tomlin. They awarded the Ruizes compensatory and exemplary damages, though punitive damages were later dismissed because the jury was not unanimous on Kia's negligence. The trial court's final judgment awarded the Ruizes $887,400 in damages, and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.

Further details of the case involve the discussion of section 82.008 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which offers a nonliability presumption to manufacturers if their product complies with federal safety standards. Kia argued that its air bag design complied with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), specifically FMVSS 208, and therefore, it was entitled to this presumption. However, the court found FMVSS 208 does not govern the risk of an air bag's failure to deploy, but rather assumes deployment and measures occupant protection, making the presumption inapplicable in this case.

Other issues included whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other similar incidents from a spreadsheet containing 432 paid warranty claims, only 67 of which involved the same error code related to Andrea's case. The court concluded that although some of the claims were admissible, many were not relevant to the underlying proceedings, consequently the admission of the spreadsheet as a whole was deemed erroneous.","The Texas Supreme Court will likely hold that although the trial court correctly refused to apply the statutory presumption of nonliability to Kia, as FMVSS 208 did not govern the product risk of an air bag failing to deploy, the trial court committed reversible error by admitting the spreadsheet of warranty claims. The Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence of the code-56 claims on the spreadsheet, which implicated the same connectors as in the Ruiz case, could have been admissible for their design-defect finding. However, admitting nearly 85% of other irrelevant claims based on the spreadsheet without proper distinction between relevant and irrelevant claims will be seen as prejudicial to Kia.

Additionally, the verdict will likely emphasize that while the Ruiz family provided sufficient evidence to support their claim of a design defect, the errors in admitting the spreadsheet potentially influenced the jury's judgment due to the volume of irrelevant information presented. Thus, the Supreme Court will find that the error probably resulted in an improper judgment, leading to reversing the trial court's decision and remanding the case for a new trial, focusing on the relevancy and proper admission of similar incident evidence. The verdict might also likely address procedural aspects regarding objections and limiting instructions under the Texas Rules of Evidence."
"The appellant, Julie Anne Fagan Hall, filed for divorce in 1987 and was represented by six different attorneys during her divorce proceedings. Post-divorce, Hall sued her former attorneys and law firms, along with her consulting accountant, alleging professional malpractice, gross negligence, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Her allegations against the attorneys were that they failed to perform their duties properly, such as not filing inventories and appraisals, not seeking sanctions against her ex-husband for non-compliance, and withdrawing from her representation without adequate cause. With regard to her consulting accountant, she claimed he failed to testify about a conflicting 1986 corporate tax return during her divorce trial.

The attorneys filed motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted after severing the claims into two suits. Hall attempted to file motions for new trials, which were initially granted on limited questions about overlooked assets, but later the summary judgments were reinstated when Hall did not properly respond to the court's questions. Hall then appealed the reinstatement of the summary judgments, acting pro se, claiming that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding her claims, and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate. Her appeals involved questioning the procedural conduct of the trial court, including assertions that a new trial had been improperly granted and challenging the basis on which the summary judgments were affirmed.","The appellate court upheld the summary judgments in favor of all appellees, finding Hall's arguments unpersuasive. The court applied the legal injury rule to establish that the second attorney was not liable for malpractice, as Hall's claim against him was filed outside of the statute of limitations. In terms of the remaining appellees, the court determined that Hall failed to establish a prima facie case for attorney professional malpractice based on negligence due to lack of evidence about the producing cause of liability. Hall also did not succeed on her claims of gross negligence because she failed to provide competent controverting evidence that demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the challenged element. Regarding her DTPA claims, Hall's actions were considered barred by the Act's statute of limitations.

The court's reasoning was that Hall did not provide evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Hall's affidavits, used to respond to the summary judgment motions, were either based on preliminary opinions or referred to a large volume of attached documents without specifically interpreting them or identifying where they demonstrated genuine issues. By not properly guiding the court through the evidence to point out material factual disputes, Hall effectively failed to meet her burden as the nonmovant in a summary judgment situation. Thus, the summary judgments were affirmed on the basis that Hall did not properly toll the applicable statutes of limitations and could not demonstrate a producing cause for liability under the DTPA."
"The appellant, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), was involved in a negligence suit with the appellee, Paul Danesi, a former patient. Mr. Danesi was admitted to UTMB on April 26, 1991, for leg pain diagnosed as blood clots. On May 5, 1991, he claimed to have been given the wrong medication by the hospital's nursing staff, which led to an episode of congestive heart failure or volume overload. Mr. Danesi filed suit alleging UTMB's negligence in administering the wrong medication, causing him anxiety, shortness of breath, and emotional distress, seeking $100,000.00 in actual damages. 

At trial, evidence was presented by both parties regarding the alleged medication error. Mr. Danesi and his wife testified about the event's emotional impact on him, including his belief that he would die due to the medication errors. Mr. Danesi's medical record contained a doctor's note about his anxiety over the error, and a registered nurse, Susan Adkins, testified that Mr. Danesi's records indicated he received the wrong medications and that patients commonly experience anxiety in such situations. 

On the other side, UTMB contested that Mr. Danesi ever received the wrong medication, presenting testimony from nurses that his chart had been mistakenly switched with another patient's chart. Expert testimony from Dr. Marschall Runge suggested that Mr. Danesi's heart problems, not medication errors, caused his symptoms, an assertion which contradicted nurse Adkins's testimony.

The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Mr. Danesi for $300,000.00, which was later reduced to $250,000.00 due to limits on damages recoverable against the state or a state agency. UTMB filed motions for a directed verdict, judgment non obstante verdicto (notwithstanding the verdict), and a new trial, all of which were denied by the trial court. UTMB appealed the decision.","The Court is likely to affirm the judgment in appellee's favor. The key consideration is that there was sufficient probative evidence of the nature, severity, and duration of appellee's mental anguish due to the alleged medication error to support a mental anguish award. This is based on both Mr. Danesi's and his wife's testimonies, and medical records verifying Mr. Danesi's anxiety that were presented during the trial. 

Regarding proximate cause, the court will reject UTMB's claim regarding the lack of competent expert testimony to link UTMB's actions to Mr. Danesi's injuries. The court will hold that a nurse is competent to present expert testimony about medical causation, as shown by nurse Adkins's testimony. Moreover, considering evidence in support of the verdict, there will be a finding of more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the jury's determining that UTMB's negligence in administering improper medication proximately caused Mr. Danesi's injuries.

The court will also be expected to reject the argument that the jury award was excessive. The jury is granted wide discretion in awarding damages for mental anguish, so long as the award is fair and reasonable. In this regard, the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Danesi will provide sufficient basis for the jury's compensation determination, which encompasses both past and future physical pain and mental anguish. 

Additionally, the court will likely not find fault in the trial court's decision to submit the case to the jury, or in allowing postverdict amendments to Mr. Danesi's pleadings to conform to the jury's verdict. This is especially relevant considering both sides of the case and the Texas Supreme Court's allowance for emotional distress awards in specific relationships like patient-physician, even without showing physical injury.

Lastly, the court will disagree with UTMB's contention that the previous medical history of Mr. Danesi or the deposition testimony of nurse Adkins was wrongfully excluded, as the court will likely rule such evidence as cumulative and not reversible error. UTMB's challenge concerning jurisdiction based on the damages awarded and amended petitions will also likely be dismissed because the original petition was within the jurisdictional limits and subsequent amendments sought additional damages accruing over time, which is permissible. The court's reasoning will affirm that the trial court did not exceed its jurisdictional limits. 

In conclusion, the judgment in favor of the appellee will be affirmed due to the legal and factual sufficiency of evidence supporting the jury's award for mental anguish, the jury's finding of proximate cause, and the jury's determination of the appropriate damages award. Further, the court's procedural rulings regarding submissions to the jury, postverdict amendments, and jurisdiction will be upheld.

"Seventy-one-year-old George Wakefield underwent surgery to repair an ankle fracture and was administered anesthesia by Steve I.O. Wilson, M.D., using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). George Wakefield had a complicated medical history, which included lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and esophageal cancer for which he had an esophagectomy and a gastric pull-up procedure, leaving him at a high risk for aspiration during the surgery. After the surgery, George was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which led to acute respiratory failure and subsequently his death.

George's wife, Ellen S. Wakefield, and his son, Vann Doyle Wakefield, sued Pinnacle Anesthesia Consultants, P.A., claiming that the use of the LMA instead of an endotracheal tube with an inflatable cuff (ETT) caused George's aspiration and death. They further alleged a lack of informed consent on the risks associated with the LMA procedure. Their designated expert, Steven Schrenzel, M.D., testified that the use of the LMA was contraindicated for George due to his high risk of aspiration and that its use proximately caused his death. Schrenzel opined that an ETT would have been safer in preventing aspiration for a high-risk patient like George.

However, on Pinnacle's motion, the trial court excluded Schrenzel's testimony as scientifically unreliable and then entered a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Pinnacle. On appeal, Wakefield argued that the trial court erred in striking Schrenzel's testimony, in granting Pinnacle's no-evidence motion for summary judgment on negligence claims, and on the informed-consent claim.","The appellate court found that Schrenzel's opinion on the medical standard of care was scientifically reliable due to his extensive clinical experience, the package insert for the LMA, and medical literature supporting his view that an ETT was indicated over an LMA for a high-risk patient like George.

On the other hand, the appellate court predicted that Schrenzel's opinion on medical causation would be deemed unreliable, as the evidence showed no clinical signs of aspiration during the surgery and it was equally plausible that aspiration occurred postoperatively. Schrenzel could not adequately support the likelihood that aspiration during surgery was more likely, lacking personal clinical experience of silent intra-operative aspirations that manifested post-operatively and without broad reading of medical literature to support his opinion. As a result, the court would likely find that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the negligence claims due to the lack of admissible testimony on proximate cause.

Regarding the informed consent claim, the court would predict that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Pinnacle. The rightfully obtained informed consent through compliance with List A, which covers general anesthesia, would be regarded as effective, and any claims of misrepresentation would not rebut the presumption without allegations of the invalidity of the consent form itself, such as forgery or lack of capacity.

Thus, the appellate court would likely affirm the trial court's judgment, supporting the verdict in favor of Pinnacle on both the negligence and informed consent claims."
"Linda Faust and Donnie Faust, the plaintiffs in this case, sued BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), alleging that BNSF's negligence at its wood treatment facility in Somerville, Texas, caused their personal injuries and damages, including Linda's stomach cancer. The Fausts lived and worked near the Somerville Tie Plant, where Donnie came into contact with creosote, a chemical used in wood treatment, as part of his job since 1974. Linda, having worked in various jobs near the plant, had also been exposed to the facility's emissions.

The plant, which was operational 24/7 and had been run by BNSF's predecessor since 1905, treated wood with a mixture of creosote and oil. Waste generated included drainage from treatment cylinders, kickback from treated ties, treated wood slats, sawdust, boiler emissions, wastewater, and atmospheric emissions. The plant's waste management and disposal methods were contentious issues at trial.

The Fausts claimed BNSF negligently allowed the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, causing continuous exposure and contamination, resulting in injuries and property damage. Linda had smoked cigarettes for twenty-five years, between half and a full pack daily, experienced gastrointestinal symptoms since the early 1980s, and was diagnosed with diffuse signet cell stomach cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection in 1998.

They cited substantial evidence to support their claims, including expert testimony on BNSF's alleged negligence in operating the plant and handling waste, pollution, and employee safety.

The defendants presented contrary evidence for each point the plaintiffs brought up. Specifically, they challenged the calculation of waste burned in the plant's boilers, the amount of drainage after treatment, and the daily burning of kickback and treated wood. They also disputed the need for and efficacy of an incinerator for waste disposal, which the plaintiffs claimed BNSF was negligent for not having.","Upon appeal, it will be likely predicted that the court would affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of BNSF based on a number of factors assessed in the appeal. The court will find no error with the specific causation instruction provided to the jury, meaning the jury's charge to exclude with reasonable certainty other plausible causes for Linda Faust's cancer, such as smoking and H. pylori infection, was appropriate. The jurors, as factfinders, were rightly instructed that other potential causes for Linda's stomach cancer had to be reasonably excluded in order to establish specific causation for exposure from the Somerville Tie Plant.

Moreover, the court will probably conclude that the evidence was factually sufficient to support the jury's determination. Given the conflicting evidence about how much toxic waste was actually burned in the boilers, the variations in the quantities of chemicals emitted during treatment processes, the amount of waste produced, the protective measures offered to employees, and other factors, the jury could have reasonably found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proof on negligence. As such, it was likely within the jury's prerogative to reject the claim that BNSF's negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of Linda's cancer, particularly in light of the multiple other possible factors contributing to her condition.

The court will see no merit in the arguments that the trial court shifted its gatekeeper function regarding expert testimony admission to the jury, nor that the instruction given was an impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence. The instruction did not mislead the jury or place the judge's responsibility on them.

It will be observed that under the applicable legal standards, including the need to establish both general and specific causation, the jury was correctly guided to consider whether plaintiffs had excluded other potential causes of Linda's cancer with reasonable certainty. In affirming the trial court, the decision will rest on principles of evidentiary sufficiency and proper jury instruction, finding that the trial court did not err in its approach or its ultimate determination.

Given the detailed and complex evidence presented during the trial, with expert opinions conflicting on key issues, it was the jury’s province to resolve these conflicts. The appellate court, therefore, will be expected to defer to the jury's findings on factual disputes, especially where the evidence was sufficiently balanced to support the verdict reached."
"National Health Insurance Company (""National Health""), an underwriter, entered into a business relationship with CRS Marketing Agency (""CRS"") and National Plan Administrators, a third-party insurance administrator owned by CRS. National Health contracted with CRS to exclusively market their policies, while National Plan Administrators would handle administrative tasks. The relationship was formalized through a ""Request for Proposal"" process and legal agreements which delineated responsibilities and profit-sharing.

Over time, CRS began searching for other insurance carriers and eventually entered negotiations with Hartford Life Insurance Company (""Hartford""). While still under contract with National Health, CRS, through its owner, Sommerlatte, started facilitating the transfer of National Health's active-at-work policies to Hartford, sharing proprietary policy information with them.

National Health's insurance rating was declining, and their book of business was not growing. CRS took advantage of this to make deals with Hartford. When National Health planned to exit the market, it was negotiating with United Teachers Insurance Association to sell the policies but allowed National Plan Administrators an opportunity to find an alternative buyer. However, CRS and National Plan Administrators worked towards moving the policies to Hartford on an active-at-work basis, without fully informing National Health of the actions or intentions, causing National Health to lose a significant part of its book of business.

National Health filed suit, alleging breaches of contract and fiduciary duties, as well as trade secret misappropriation, seeking damages and attorney's fees. The jury found CRS and National Plan Administrators operated as a single business enterprise, found breaches of contract and fiduciary duty against National Plan Administrators, and awarded damages. The trial court rendered a judgment for actual and exemplary damages.","The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. Overall, the court deemed that National Plan Administrators owed National Health a general fiduciary duty, grounded in the statutes regulating third-party administrators, the specific details of the written agreements between parties, and the broader common-law principles concerning the duties of agents. The jury's findings, which assessed that CRS and National Plan Administrators functioned as a single business enterprise, were supported by the evidence showing the intermingling of operations and the presentation of both entities as a unified front in negotiations. The actively-at-work offer was directly tied to National Plan Administrators' actions constituting a breach of fiduciary duty, and the evidence suggesting malice was sufficient under the definition stipulated in the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.001(7)(B) (1997), as the acts involved extreme risk and indicated a conscious indifference to the rights of National Health.

Despite CRS's contention that the single-business-enterprise doctrine was not a valid theory under Texas law for imposing joint liability, the court determined that the doctrine was appropriate for piercing the corporate veil in this scenario given the integrated business operations and common pursuit of business aims by CRS and National Plan Administrators. Consequently, the imposition of damages, notably punitive damages, jointly against CRS and National Plan Administrators did not contravene Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.006, and thus was ruled permissible by the court."
"Louise Altimore, the wife of a lifetime Exxon employee Mike Altimore, sued Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon), alleging she was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma, a rare and almost universally fatal disease, in April 2003 because of asbestos exposure brought home on her husband's work clothing. The claim was that Exxon negligently permitted Mr. Altimore to bring home asbestos dust on his clothes, leading to Mrs. Altimore's exposure while laundering them. The jury ruled in Mrs. Altimore's favor, finding Exxon had acted negligently and with malice, awarding both actual and exemplary damages totaling $1,985,802. Post-trial, Exxon's motions for a new trial, remittitur, and to modify the judgment were overruled.

The case focused on the period between 1942, when Mr. Altimore began working at Exxon's Baytown, Texas refinery, and 1972, when he commenced employment in an air-conditioned tool room — a period identified as relevant for assessing Mrs. Altimore's exposure risks. During this time, advancements had been made in understanding the dangers of asbestos, including the association with diseases like asbestosis and lung cancer. By 1949, Exxon reportedly had identified categories of refinery workers at risk for exposure, though they did not address the issue of risk from take-home exposure.

In 1964, an epidemiological study firmly linked asbestos exposure to lung cancer and mesothelioma, indicating even minor exposure could lead to pulmonary changes, and by this time, Exxon employees had been attending conferences on asbestos-related diseases. Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, more studies concluded that asbestos exposure was causally linked to various diseases, and household exposures were identified as potentially hazardous.

By 1972, a consensus among experts suggested significant risks related to asbestos exposure, and OSHA introduced regulations to reduce workplace exposure, including prohibiting workers exposed to asbestos from wearing their work clothes home, which was understood to signal a risk to employee families for the first time.","The court will overrule Mrs. Altimore's motion for rehearing and en banc rehearing, withdraw the prior opinion, and issue a substitute opinion. It will reverse the trial court’s judgment and render a judgment that Mrs. Altimore take nothing. The court's reasoning will be anchored in the legal duty owed to Mrs. Altimore, with the central question being the foreseeability of the risk of her injury due to asbestos dust carried home by her husband on Exxon-issued clothing.

The court will find that despite the increasing body of knowledge over time indicating the risks of asbestos exposure, the specific risk to a worker's spouse from take-home asbestos was not sufficiently foreseeable to Exxon. The court will emphasize that while there was general awareness of the harmful effects of asbestos by 1972, only then -- coinciding with OSHA regulations -- was Exxon put on notice about take-home asbestos risks. However, by this time, Mr. Altimore had already transitioned to a non-asbestos-exposed environment (air-conditioned tool room). The court will conclude that during the relevant period when Mrs. Altimore could have been exposed (1942-1972), Exxon did not have a duty of care towards her, because the risk was not foreseeable within this timeframe.

The verdict will not deny asbestos exposure risks or dismiss scientific findings, but rather decide on the narrow issue of Exxon's legal duty to Mrs. Altimore. It will tie the establishment of duty to the point at which Exxon became, or should have become, aware of the risk of at-home asbestos exposure to spouses of employees. Since this awareness was not established until after Mr. Altimore ceased working in asbestos-exposing conditions, Exxon's duty to Mrs. Altimore to prevent her illness did not exist. Therefore, the court will support Exxon's appeal based on the absence of duty, rendering Mrs. Altimore's claim void."
"Harry L. Bowles, a minor, represented by his father, and his parents sued Dr. Lynn L. Bourdon for medical malpractice. On July 16, 1941, Harry suffered a fracture above his left elbow joint due to a fall. Shortly after the incident, Dr. Bourdon X-rayed the elbow, administered anesthesia, set the injury, and wrapped the arm to form a conical shape. Post-procedure, Harry's hand became very blue and cold, with purple fingernails, and he experienced pain. When Harry's mother reported these symptoms to Dr. Bourdon, he allegedly dismissed her concerns and suggested they visit the next day. Dr. Bourdon does not recall being informed of the hand's discoloration but admitted that he would have taken immediate action if such serious symptoms had been reported.

At the follow-up visit, Dr. Bourdon believed the bandage might have been too tight and loosened it slightly. Another doctor, Dr. Bloom, testified that as of July 25, Harry's arm was in ""acute state of flexion"" and that by August 21, Harry developed a ""Volkmann's contracture,"" a permanent condition characterized by the clawing of the hand and muscle wasting, resulting in limited finger movement. The plaintiffs argued that Dr. Bourdon's negligence included overly tight bandaging causing a stop in blood circulation leading to the contracture, failure to examine the arm or loosen the bandaging promptly after being informed of the symptoms, and not recognizing or treating the contracture between July 16 and August 21.

The trial court instructed a verdict in favor of Dr. Bourdon, stating that the plaintiffs failed to provide expert testimony showing the doctor's negligence and its causation in Harry’s injury. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, which concluded that the evidence did not establish the doctor's negligence as the proximate cause of the contracture, and that when multiple potential causes exist, speculation by the jury is not permissible. The issue was then taken up to the Supreme Court.","The Supreme Court will likely affirm the judgment in favor of Dr. Bourdon. The verdict will be primarily based on the lack of expert medical testimony provided by the plaintiffs that could definitively link the alleged negligence - specifically the tight binding of Harry’s arm - to the development of Volkmann's contracture. The plaintiffs must prove through a doctor of the same school of practice as the defendant that the treatment provided was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the contracture. The evidence should go beyond mere possibility and speculation and must show a direct causal connection.

Expert witnesses in the case have indicated that there are multiple potential causes for Volkmann's contracture, without giving unequivocal testimony that the doctor's actions were the primary cause. The testimony presented suggests that the contracture could have been a result of the initial injury, other medical factors (e.g., thrombosis, arterial spasm), or possibly the tight bandaging. Since the plaintiffs have not provided conclusive evidence to single out the bandaging as the definite cause of the harm suffered, they have not satisfied the legal standard required to establish causation.

Consequently, because the evidence led by the plaintiffs does not meet the threshold for causation, and given that establishment of negligence alone is not sufficient without showing causation, the court will uphold the lower courts' decisions. There is not enough evidence of direct negligence leading to the injury to move beyond the standard of speculation, and thus a verdict for the plaintiffs would not be supported by the evidence presented. The court will note the consistent condemnation of verdicts based on conjecture when more than one potential cause exists, further substantiating the judgment in favor of Dr. Bourdon."
"Alan A. H. Boggs (Alan) and his girlfriend, Misty Robertson (Misty), attended a barbecue cook-off at the Astrodome on February 9, 1996. While leaving the parking lot in Alan's truck, Alan accidentally rear-ended a Nissan Maxima, causing minor vehicular damage. An altercation ensued between Alan and one of the Nissan's passengers, Barry Bergeron, which escalated into a physical fight. During the struggle, Bergeron fatally stabbed Alan with a knife, resulting in Alan's death at the scene. Bergeron was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.
  
The plaintiffs, Alan's parents, filed a wrongful death suit against Bottomless Pit, Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo, Inc., World Championship Barbecue Contest Committee, Bayou Teche, and Corral Club, Inc. (collectively referred to as appellees), who operated a booth selling beer and liquor at the event. They claimed the appellees were negligent for: 1) failing to establish and enforce guidelines for serving alcoholic beverages, 2) failing to provide adequate security, and 3) serving alcoholic beverages to an ""obviously intoxicated"" Bergeron, which they alleged was a proximate cause of Alan's death.

Appellees filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that they were not liable under the dram-shop law or for common law negligence because their alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of Alan's death.

The trial court granted summary judgment without specifying the grounds. The plaintiffs appealed, contending that there was a genuine issue of material fact concerning the foreseeability of violence by an intoxicated person and that the trial court erred by placing the burden of proof for the summary judgment on the nonmovant plaintiffs.

The summary judgment evidence included depositions, affidavits, and testimony from various witnesses, including Bergeron and Misty Robertson, who were directly involved in the incident, as well as expert opinions regarding Bergeron's level of intoxication and its correlation to violence.","The court's affirmation of the grant of summary judgment to the defendants will be based on the foreseeability of the criminal act that led to Alan's death. The court will find that the act of murder committed by Bergeron was not a foreseeable result of the sale of alcoholic beverages to him and that his intervening criminal act was the proximate cause of Alan's death. The court will hold that providing alcohol did not create a likelihood of such a criminal act, based on the evidence regarding Bergeron's behavior at the booth, where he did not appear aggressive, obnoxious, or looking for a fight, and there was no indication that the appellees should have anticipated his violent actions.

Additionally, expert affidavits suggesting that Bergeron was ""obviously intoxicated"" and that intoxication often leads to violence will be deemed insufficient to establish a fact issue regarding the foreseeability of his criminal conduct because they do not address any specific behavior by Bergeron at the event that would signal a propensity toward violence.

The court will also address the procedural objection brought by the appellants, arguing that the burden of proof was incorrectly placed on them and that the appellees did not formally plead their affirmative defense of an intervening or superseding cause. However, the court will determine that the appellants' argument is without merit because the affirmative defense was sufficiently raised in the appellees' summary judgment motion and the appellants did not object to the lack of a formal pleading. As such, the appellants failed to preserve this point of error for appeal. Given that the plaintiffs did not present evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on the foreseeability of Bergeron's criminal conduct, the court will overrule both points of error by the appellants and affirm the summary judgment in favor of the appellees."
"Appellants, Donald Lee Tibbits and wife, Josephine P. Tibbits, brought a suit as the sole heirs of their deceased ten-year-old son, William Douglas, seeking damages from appellees, D. H. Crowell and wife, Rosa Crowell, doing business as Dixie Dude Ranch. The lawsuit pertained to a tragic event where a fire in the main ranch house led to the death of William Douglas and Cody Connally, who was the ten-year-old grandson of the appellees. The fire's cause was unknown and it began near the northeast part of the house, which subsequently burned down entirely, with the two boys being unable to escape. At the time of the fire, Cody and his parents were visiting the appellees, and William was a social guest at the appellees' home.

On the night of October 31, 1964, William arranged to spend the night with Cody; both boys were to sleep in a second-floor room, and Mrs. Connally put them to bed around 10:00 p.m. before leaving with Mr. Connally to visit friends in nearby Bandera. The appellants alleged negligence on the part of the appellees based on three specific claims: 1) failure to keep close to William to prevent harm, 2) failure to provide an adequate fire escape, and 3) failure to direct William to sleep in a room where appellees knew he could be rescued in case of a fire.

Upon the discovery of the fire by appellees, the house was significantly engulfed in flames, hindering any possible rescue efforts to reach either of the rooms (8 or 10) where the boys were likely sleeping. Evidence suggested that even if a factual issue regarding the adequacy of the fire escapes was present, it ultimately held no causative effect on William's death as there was no indication he was able to use a fire escape.","The verdict will affirm the judgment of the trial court, supporting the instructed verdict for the appellees. The reasoning behind this affirmation rests on the legal principle that there must be a direct nexus between the alleged negligent act and the resulting injury—that is, the injury must be a natural and probable cause of the negligence in question. Even assuming the supposed negligence concerning the fire escapes was factually substantiated, it will be deemed irrelevant since no evidence suggests that William was in a position to utilize the escape routes present. Furthermore, the appellees' lack of knowledge regarding which room William was sleeping in will not be considered proximately causal, given the fire's intensity prevented any access to the rooms at the time appellees were alerted to the danger. Lastly, the argument of negligence based on sleeping arrangements falls short—the appellants did not present evidence demonstrating that the appellees could have reasonably anticipated any risk to William due to the sleeping conditions. Given these points, the court will conclude that no factual issues of negligence contributing to William's death were raised, and as such, the trial court's direction to the jury for a take-nothing verdict was appropriate."
"Geneva and Albert McKinley, husband and wife, filed a lawsuit against Dr. Dennis Stripling for malpractice related to surgeries performed on Geneva's hand without obtaining her informed consent. Geneva McKinley broke her right wrist in 1980 and was treated by an orthopedic surgeon, who set the fracture. However, a malunion occurred, and she also experienced numbness and tingling in her hand. After being referred to a neurosurgeon, she was then referred to Dr. Stripling regarding the malunion. Dr. Stripling performed an osteotomy on her wrist and, in a subsequent surgery, attempted to correct her thumb's restricted movement by performing a tendon transfer from her right index finger to her thumb, a procedure that was not discussed with Mrs. McKinley, nor were the risks involved disclosed to her. Despite the successful wrist repair, she could not move her index finger post-surgery, and a later surgery to correct this issue resulted in restricted movement of her middle finger. Another doctor eventually performed corrective surgery which restored some function.

The McKinleys sued Dr. Stripling for failing to disclose the risks associated with the tendon transfer surgery. During the trial, Dr. Stripling objected to the McKinleys' failure to include a jury issue concerning proximate cause, which Geneva McKinley argued was unnecessary and refused to submit. The jury found that the inherent risks of tendon transfer surgery could influence a reasonable person in consenting to the operation, and that McKinley had suffered restricted movement as a result of the surgeries. However, a finding of proximate cause (whether failure to obtain informed consent was the cause of McKinley's injuries) was not submitted as an issue to the jury.

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the McKinleys for $19,915.08 based on that verdict. The Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision, holding that proximate cause was a required element to establish negligence on the doctor's part and that failing to request a proximate cause issue to the jury amounted to a waiver of the right to recover on the claim. The court of appeals also mentioned that the correct standard for proximate cause should be objective, considering a reasonable person, and not subjective to the specific plaintiff. The case was brought to the Texas Supreme Court for review.","It is likely that the court will affirm the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeals, upholding that Dr. Stripling is not liable to the McKinleys for negligence in treating Geneva without informed consent due to the lack of a jury finding on proximate cause. The Supreme Court will likely argue that while negligence was established, recovery under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act of Texas requires a demonstration of proximate cause, in line with traditional negligence actions. The court will probably clarify that an informed consent cause of action, while based on a statutory duty to disclose risks of surgery, still demands a finding that the breach of this duty proximately caused the injuries for liability to arise.

The court should reason that proximate cause remains a necessary element, countering any notion of strict liability, and any omission of the term ""proximate cause"" in the statute does not abrogate the requirement for its evidentiary submission to a jury. The court will likely reiterate the objective standard for informed consent actions, asserting that it is a question of whether a fully informed reasonable person would have consented to the treatment, not the actual decision of the particular plaintiff. As the McKinleys conceded that causation is a component of their claim but failed to submit a proximate cause issue despite objection, the appellate court's decision will likely be affirmed, citing the plaintiffs' waiver under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279. There can be no recovery without a jury's finding on the causation element, and thus Dr. Stripling would not be found liable due to this procedural oversight by the McKinleys."
"Gene Bailey, the appellant car buyer, sued his immediate seller, Integrity Imports Enterprise (d/b/a Integrity Motors), and the appellee upstream sellers, CarMax Auto Superstores, Inc. (""CarMax""), Phillip Smith d/b/a Elite Truck Sales (""Elite""), and Christopher Fleck (""Fleck""), after discovering that the Mercedes vehicle he had purchased lacked good title, being previously stolen. The 61st District Court of Harris County, Texas, was presented with this case.

Bailey's purchase took place in December 2000, after a sequence of transactions beginning with CarMax, which bought the car for $22,000 in September 2000 believing it to be a good title. CarMax then sold the vehicle through a buy-bid to Fleck, who never actually took title but set up a sale from CarMax to Elite, and Elite eventually sold the vehicle to Integrity for $26,500. Bailey financed the purchase price through his firefighters union credit and received a Texas title for the car. However, the revelation that the vehicle was stolen and subsequently recovered by police in April 2001 led to a series of notifications up the chain of title, with CarMax and Elite issuing refunds intended to reach Bailey, which never did.

Bailey's lawsuit, filed in November 2001, encompassed claims such as breach of contract and conversion against Integrity, and breach of express and implied warranty of title, violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (""DTPA""), negligent misrepresentation, negligence and gross negligence, fraud, negligence per se for violating the Texas Certificate of Title Act, and civil conspiracy against the upstream sellers. His immediate seller, Integrity, defaulted, and judgments pending cost determination were made against Taylor and Jackson, individuals associated with Integrity.

The case evolved with multiple amended petitions filed by Bailey, no-evidence motions for summary judgment by CarMax, Elite, and Fleck, and general procedural challenges, ultimately leading to this appeal after a third amended petition asserting a new cause of action was struck by the trial court as prejudicial and summarily dismissed orders granting no-evidence motions for summary judgment by CarMax, Elite, and Fleck.","Given the detailed procedural posture and factual background involving various legal theories pursued by Bailey, the court's verdict will reflect an intricate analysis of applicable laws and standards. The court's ruling will sustain the trial court's orders granting no-evidence motions for summary judgment for CarMax and Fleck on all claims while reversing the trial court's order granting summary judgment for Elite as to the breach of warranty claim.

The court will uphold the trial court's order striking Bailey's third amended petition, recognizing that introducing a new cause of action shortly before trial constitutes prejudice to the defendants who had been out of the suit for an extended period of time. The new claim for ""money had and received"" introduced an entirely new dimension to the proceedings that disrupted the fairness of the process for the defendants.

Regarding the breach of warranty claim, the court will likely determine that Elite incorrectly argued that it could not have breached any express warranty, as it was indeed in the chain of title, contrary to its claim of merely financing the vehicle. Considering the procedural requirements and the lack of notice for Elite on other potential arguments for summary judgment, the court will not uphold the summary judgment granted in favor of Elite for the breach of warranty claim, necessitating a remand for further proceedings on this issue.

For the other causes of action, including negligence per se, negligence and gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation, DTPA violations, and fraud, the court will likely affirm the decisions for the defendants, as Bailey’s evidence may not sufficiently connect any alleged negligence or misconduct of upstream sellers to his purchase of the stolen vehicle. The legal analyses will hinge on principles of duty, causation, proximate cause, and producing cause, as well as the requirements for liability under specific causes of action such as the DTPA or fraudulent misrepresentation.

The court’s predictions will likely be grounded in the nuances of Texas commercial code, tort law, and DTPA provisions; considering the intricacies of the chain of title obligations, statutory notice requirements, and the allocation of liabilities in commercial transactions involving successive buyers and sellers."
"Brayton Gray, an 80-year-old with end-stage Parkinson's disease, was admitted to the Woodville nursing home on December 27, 1999, after surgery for a right hip fracture. He also had a history of angioplasty and was considered anorexic. During his stay at Woodville, Gray developed two infections: an upper respiratory infection treated with antibiotics and a urinary tract infection requiring hospitalization. On January 26, 2000, Gray's condition worsened and he became non-responsive. Dr. Evans spoke with Gray's family about his condition and recommended hospice care, which the family agreed to. Subsequently, Dr. Evans stopped most of Gray's medications except for a few and altered his diet to thickened liquids upon request. Gray died the next day.

Appellants, Gray's daughters (Martha Gray, Rose Marie Salvato) and the executor of the estate (Edmund Higginbotham), filed a wrongful death suit against Dr. Evans and Woodville Healthcare Center, alleging medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment, claiming the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of causation or breach of standard of care. The trial court granted Dr. Evans' no-evidence motion and Woodville's traditional and no-evidence motions.

Appellants claimed that Appellees violated the decedent's Fourteenth Amendment rights by depriving him of his right to make healthcare decisions. The court found that the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable due to lack of state action and that appellants had no standing to pursue constitutional claims under the Fourteenth Amendment because the rights are personal and the suit was filed under the Wrongful Death Act, not the Texas Survivor Statute.

For the summary judgment, appellants needed to produce evidence of causation, which is a component of medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se. Appellants provided the affidavit and deposition testimony of Dr. Eichelberger, their expert physician, and depositions from nurses Judith Anders and Ann Robbins. The court found Dr. Eichelberger's affidavit and testimony to be conclusory or speculative, with no explanation as to how appellees’ actions caused death. The court similarly found the nurses' testimonies to be conclusory, not establishing a causal connection to the death.","Given the appellants' failure to present sufficient evidence to prove causation, which is a critical component of their claims for medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The foundation of the decision lies in the deficiency of the appellants' expert testimony. As the expert's affidavit and deposition did not explain a direct causal connection between the alleged breaches and Gray's death, failing to meet the legal standard of establishing causation through ""reasonable medical probability"" rather than conjecture or possibility.

Specifically, the court focused on the absence of sufficient explanation as to how the discontinuation of medication or the withdrawal of nutrition by the appellees resulted in the decedent's death. Without such clarification, the expert's statement is deemed conclusory and thus insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding causation. Furthermore, the nurses' testimonies did not establish causation, as the depositions did not connect the lack of hydration or the care provided to Gray's death, making them equally conclusory.

Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment claim, the court determines a lack of standing and applicability because the rights protected are personal and the Wrongful Death Act does not provide a recovery for the decedent’s injuries. Moreover, there was no evidence of state action, rendering the constitutional claim moot.

Considering all of these points, the court will reject the appellants' claims and uphold the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellees. The reasoning of the appellate court is in alignment with accepted legal principles, which require concrete evidence of causation, particularly expert testimony that links alleged breaches of a standard of care to the injury or death in question."
"The appellant, JCW Electronics, Inc. (""JCW""), a telephone service provider, entered into a contract with the City of Port Isabel to provide telephone services for the Port Isabel City Jail. As per the contract, JCW installed a coinless telephone inside each jail cell for inmates to make collect calls. Rolando Domingo Montez, a 19-year-old, was arrested for public intoxication and placed in Cell No. 1 of the Port Isabel City Jail. The day after Montez made several calls requesting bail, he was found dead in his cell, having hanged himself with the telephone cord. Appellees, Pearl Iriz Garza, individually and on behalf of Montez's estate, and Belinda Leigh Camacho, individually and as next friend of Montez's minor child, sued JCW claiming negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, strict liability, and misrepresentation.

The jury found in favor of the appellees on negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of implied warranty of fitness. No damages were found for Camacho in her individual capacity. Post-verdict, appellees filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, seeking judgment for breach of contract and fraud, which the trial court granted. The trial court awarded the appellees attorneys' fees, guardian ad litem fees, and costs. JCW appealed, challenging the trial court's judgment on grounds that breach of contract was not pleaded or tried by consent and that if appellees successfully pleaded fraud, they were barred from recovering damages due to the jury finding that 60% of the responsibility for the inmate's death was his own. JCW further disputed the sufficiency of the evidence for breach of implied warranty of fitness and the award of costs and attorney fees.","The appellate court found that the trial court erred regarding the breach of contract claim since it was not properly pleaded, submitted to the jury, or tried by consent. As breach of contract and breach of warranty are separate causes of action, they must be separately pleaded. Since appellees' pleadings did not explicitly state a claim for breach of contract, JCW was not required to file special exceptions to this unraised cause.

Concerning the fraud claim, chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code barred appellees from recovering damages because the jury found Montez to be more than 50% responsible for his death, disallowing damages in tort-based claims above that threshold.

The appellate court also acknowledged that there was more than a scintilla of evidence suggesting that the telephones were not safe for the particular purpose of unattended or unsupervised use by inmates. Thus, the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to show causation directly related to the presence of the telephone in the jail cell. Hence, the jury's decision for breach of implied warranty of fitness was supported.

Moreover, the court examined the award of attorney fees and costs. It concluded that the award of attorney fees was improper, as such fees are not recoverable for a UCC breach of warranty claim. The court modified the award of costs, affirming appropriate costs for filing, court reporter fees, and guardian ad litem fees and removing awards for expert witness travel, per diem expenses, and photocopying costs which were not required by law.

The judgement was reversed concerning the award of attorney fees and certain costs, and modified to emphasize breach of implied warranty of fitness as a cause of action. The verdict as modified was affirmed, supporting the findings of breach of implied warranty of fitness but not breach of contract or recovery of fraud, according to the evidence and given legal standards."
"The appeal to the Texas court concerns a lawsuit brought by appellants John L. Bolin, Petrea Kay Bolin, Kenneth L. Pfoff, and Gwendolyn Pfoff seeking damages for personal injuries resulting from a car accident that occurred on September 24, 1961. The accident took place on Mustang Island Road in Nueces County, Texas, at a site where the appellees, Tenneco Oil Company (referred to as Tenneco) and Loyd W. Richardson Construction Corporation (referred to as Richardson), had made temporary repairs following damage by Hurricane Carla around September 10-12, 1961.

Hurricane Carla caused significant damage to the area, washing out a 75-foot or more gap in Mustang Island Road. To make it passable for trucks accessing Tenneco's oil facilities, Richardson undertook repairs, which included filling the gap with shell mud and constructing ramps at both ends leading to the bottom of the washout from the roadway. However, the repair only allowed for one-lane traffic and did not fill the road to its normal capacity, leaving a slanting drop of about four feet from the top of the regular road bed to the bottom of the washed-out area. Before the repairs, the washed-out area had a clearly impassable four-foot drop at either end.

The appellants were beachcombing in the area and used the repaired road when returning from their activities. The driver, John L. Bolin, lost control of the car on the soft surface, causing the vehicle to go out of control and resulting in injuries to all occupants. The appellants sued for damages, alleging that the appellees owed them a duty to exercise care in maintaining the road, and accused them of various acts of negligence related to the road's condition and the absence of adequate warnings.

In the trial court, the appellees argued they owed no duty to the appellants to repair or warn about the condition of the road and that the injured parties were contributory negligent. The trial court granted summary judgment in their favor without specifying the reasons why, prompting the appeal.","The court will predictably find that the summary judgment was improperly granted because genuine issues of material fact existed which required resolution by a jury, rather than a judge. The necessary determinations include whether the appellees owed a duty to the appellants, whether that duty was breached, whether the appellants were contributorily negligent, whether any such contributory negligence was sufficient to bar recovery, and whether the appellants assumed the risk of their actions (volenti non fit injuria). 

The reasoning for potentially overturning the summary judgment will likely include the assertion that the appellees, through their voluntary actions, may have had a duty to make the temporarily repaired road safe for motorists like the appellants, and that the changes in the road condition might not have been so obvious as to absolve the appellees of the need to warn road users. Additionally, the court would indicate that the appellants' contributory negligence and assumption of risk were not conclusively established by the evidence in the summary judgment record, so the issues should be considered by a jury. Furthermore, the relationship between the appellees concerning responsibility for the road's conditions could be relevant and may need a verdict from the same jury. The outcome predicted will be that the summary judgment will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for a new trial to resolve these fact issues."
"The case involves an appellant, the daughter and administratrix of the decedent's estate, who sought review of a decision from the 5th Judicial District Court of Cass County, Texas. The decision in question granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) for the appellee company in a wrongful death action. 

A foreman working for the appellee company had failed to lock the chains on the rack of a truck, as he planned on loading the truck before it would be driven again. However, before this could happen, the truck was stolen. The unsecured chains subsequently fell off and severed the air brake hose, causing the brakes to lock and stopping the vehicle. The thief abandoned the truck in the middle of the highway at night with no lights on. Tragically, the decedent collided with the truck, resulting in his death.

The jury initially found in favor of the appellant, ruling that the appellee's negligence was the proximate cause of the wrongful death, and awarded damages. However, the appellee company filed for a JNOV, alternatively requesting to disregard the jury's findings. The trial court granted the JNOV and the appellant appealed the decision.","The court will affirm the trial court's granting of the JNOV, and conclude that the appellee company is not liable for the injuries caused by the thief's negligent operation of the truck. The reasoning will be that while it was negligence to not secure the chains, it was not foreseeable that the truck would be stolen and then abandoned in a dangerous manner on the highway. The lack of foreseeability means that the unsecured chains could not be considered the direct or immediate cause of the accident.

The court will find that the appellee had no duty to anticipate the vehicle's theft or the negligent and extraordinary manner in which it was subsequently left on the highway. 

Despite the appellant’s contention that the conditions the company's foreman created were dangerous and should have been foreseen, the court will hold that this specific chain of events was unpredictable. No previous evidence of thefts or burglaries will be presented that would have put the appellee on notice of such criminal activity being likely.

Additionally, the court will not find evidence to support a direct causal relation between the negligence of failing to secure the chains and the injuries incurred because the chains would only present a traffic hazard if the truck were driven, and the subsequent abandonment of the truck on the highway was a new and independent cause of the accident. The abandonment on the highway, rather than the unsecured chains, will be recognized as the active cause of the injuries, thus severing any direct legal connection between the appellee's action and the accident. 

Ultimately, the ruling will conclude that the company's actions were not the proximate cause of the accident. The court will decidedly uphold the judgment of the trial court."
"In February 2015, Joslyn Markham, an eighteen-year-old, was fatally injured, and her older sister Naomi was seriously hurt when their pickup truck veered onto the shoulder of Highway 281 past Jones Maltsberger road, hit a guardrail, and fell approximately forty feet, landing inverted. The family, including Naomi, her parents Carrie and Trevor Markham, and Trevor Markham as the administrator of Joslyn's estate (collectively the Markhams), sued the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) for premises defect; ISI Contracting, Inc. for negligence and negligent undertaking; ISI and Guerra Construction for breach of contract (under a third-party beneficiary status); and all defendants for ""concerted wrongful conduct.""

The Markhams claimed that the guardrail had been damaged months earlier and was repaired by ISI and Guerra Construction, who replaced the guardrail at a height lower than TxDOT's standards, causing the fatal accident. Both ISI and Guerra moved for summary judgment, invoking an affirmative defense under section 97.002, arguing they were immune from liability as they complied with their contract documents as highway repair contractors.

The trial court denied the motions for summary judgment, leading to ISI and Guerra's interlocutory appeal. ISI argued they were entitled to summary judgment against all the Markhams' claims, based on their affirmative defense under section 97.002. Additionally, they claimed they were entitled to summary judgment against the Markhams' breach of contract claims as third-party beneficiaries because the contracts expressly excluded third-party beneficiaries. Guerra joined ISI's first two issues and asserted that concert of action was not a valid cause of action in this case.

The appellate court considered whether ISI and Guerra's work on the guardrail constituted ‘repairs,’ whether the guardrail was part of a 'highway,' and whether the contractors complied with contract documents material to the guardrail repair. The court held that ISI and Guerra’s work did constitute ‘repairs’ to the highway and that the guardrail was part of the highway. Also, the court found that the contractors had complied with the contract documents as their work was approved by a TxDOT Engineer whose decisions regarding the work performed and compliance with contract documents were final and binding.","The court will predict that ISI and Guerra are immune from liability because they are highway repair contractors who complied with their contract documents, as delineated in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem Code Ann. § 97.002. Despite the actual height of the guardrail being below TxDOT's standard level, it is not material given the Engineer's approval of the work. Given the court's interpretation of section 97.002, the statute's liability shield applies to the contractors, shielding them from all claims, both tort and contract. Consequently, the court will find that ISI and Guerra are entitled to summary judgment against the Markhams' third-party beneficiary and concert of action claims, primarily based on the statutory immunity provision.

The summary judgment evidence will clearly establish that the contractors met all requirements for the statutory affirmative defense to apply. These elements include that ISI and Guerra were contractors who repaired part of a highway for TxDOT and that they were in compliance with the contract documents material to the condition or defect that allegedly caused personal injury and death. The court's application of the statutory defense will dictate that the contractors' compliance with the pertinent contract documents is confirmed through the Engineer’s approval of the work. Therefore, the trial court's error in denying the motions for summary judgment will be reversed, and the court will render a judgment dismissing all the Markhams' claims against ISI and Guerra."
"Lisa De La Fuente had previously given birth via cesarean section and anticipated delivering her third child, Giovani, vaginally. She was admitted to Spohn and treated by Dr. Juan Caceres. During labor, augmented with the drug Pitocin, Giovani began experiencing heart decelerations, and Lisa faced pain and vomiting. After Giovani entered bradycardia, Dr. Caceres called for an emergency cesarean section. In the operating room where the nurses initially could not detect Giovani's heartbeat, it was discovered that Lisa had suffered a ruptured uterus and placental abruption. Giovani was stillborn but was resuscitated; however, he suffered profound brain damage from oxygen loss.

The De La Fuentes sued Spohn and Dr. Caceres, alleging negligence in the administration of Pitocin and delay in performing the cesarean section. Before trial, a settlement was reached with Dr. Caceres resulting in a high-low agreement, where the jury found Spohn negligent but not Dr. Caceres.

The testimony revealed a possible delay at multiple points: Spohn's failure to identify signs of uterine rupture and delaying the cesarean section decision, moving Lisa to the operating room, and preparing the operating room for surgery. Experts contended that Spohn delayed seven minutes to approach the operating room and 11 minutes to begin surgery after calling for an emergency cesarean, arguing that it was an unacceptable duration. Evidence also suggested Spohn's medical records were not consistent with the videotape taken during labor.

Regarding Pitocin administration, expert testimonies indicated that its misuse could lead to hyperstimulation and uterine rupture, especially in women attempting vaginal birth post-cesarean. The medication's insert supported this claim. However, there was disagreement among medical professionals on this point.

The jury awarded the De La Fuentes damages for past and future medical expenses, as well as mental anguish for the parents, but Spohn challenged several aspects of the trial court's judgment.","In the appeal decision, the court would find there was legally and factually sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude Spohn was negligent and such negligence proximately caused Giovani's injuries, based on the ample evidence of delay, the association between Pitocin administration and uterine rupture, and expert testimonies found credible by the jury.

However, the court would also determine that the trial court erred in awarding mental anguish damages to the parents since parents cannot recover for mental anguish damages for the negligent infliction of non-fatal injuries to their children under Texas law.

Furthermore, the appellate court would confirm the trial court's judgment regarding future medical expenses, despite Spohn's objections to Dr. Willingham's testimony on life expectancy and the claimed potential overestimation of costs. The jury had evidence to determine that future medical care was a reasonable probability, with expert testimony complementing the staggering medical costs already incurred by the De La Fuentes, thus providing a legally and factually sufficient basis for the $5,000,000 award.

Regarding past medical expenses, the court would reject Spohn's claim that Dr. Willingham's reliance on summaries was insufficient, citing rule allowing experts to base opinions on data of the kind reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field. Thus, the jury's less-than-total incurred amount awarded would be upheld as supported by sufficient evidence.

As for the procedural errors claimed by Spohn, the court would likely find no reversible errors were committed that affected the fairness of the trial process. Regarding the settlement credit contention, since Spohn, upon its own request, allowed the credits to be applied proportionally, it would be barred from disputing this. Furthermore, since they did not make a timely objection to the settlement credit allocation, error preservation rules prevent them from success on this point on appeal."
"Appellant, Dr. Hans Wendenburg, is challenging the judgment made by the 215th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which favored appellees Suzanne and Rickie Williams in a medical malpractice action. The appellees initiated the lawsuit following an incident where Dr. Wendenburg perforated Suzanne Williams' iliac artery and iliac vein during her lumbar laminectomy surgery. At the original trial, the jury was given a res ipsa loquitur instruction, which can infer negligence when an injury occurs under circumstances that usually do not happen without negligence, and the defendant had exclusive control over the cause. The trial resulted in the jury finding in favor of the appellees, concluding the appellant's negligence caused Mrs. Williams' injuries.

Dr. Wendenburg does not dispute the perforation of Mrs. Williams’ blood vessels but argues that it did not result from his negligence. The case turned on the applicability of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. The doctrine’s use is limited in medical malpractice cases per Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4590i, § 7.01 (1989), and only applies in scenarios where the nature of the alleged malpractice and resulting injuries are sufficiently obvious for laymen to understand without expert testimony. Texas courts had recognized exceptions for instances such as operating on the wrong part of the body, mishandling of mechanical instruments, or leaving surgical instruments or sponges inside a patient.

The appellees argued that res ipsa loquitur was applicable for two reasons: Dr. Wendenburg performed surgery on the wrong part of the body and used a mechanical instrument (a pituitary rongeur) during the procedure. Both Dr. Wendenburg and another expert witness, Dr. Robert Grossman, testified that the iliac artery and iliac vein are in proximity to where the surgery was correctly performed, indicating no operation on the wrong part of the body took place. Regarding the use of the pituitary rongeur, the court noted that proper use of such an instrument is beyond layman’s common knowledge, and extensive training is required.","The court will reverse the lower court's judgment against Dr. Wendenburg, as the trial court committed reversible error in submitting the negligence issue with a res ipsa loquitur instruction. The verdict is based on finding that neither of the cited exceptions for the application of res ipsa loquitur—operating on the wrong body part and injury due to a mechanical instrument—are applicable in this case. The appellant had not intentionally operated on an incorrect body part, as the injured blood vessels were adjacent to the surgical site. Moreover, the pituitary rongeur used is a sophisticated tool requiring specific training, making its use not within the purview of laymen's understanding.

Although the court will conclude that the res ipsa loquitur instruction should not have been included, they will also observe that there was some evidence present that could be indicative of negligence. An example of this includes Dr. Wendenburg's admission of the rareness of the injury and a statement he made post-surgery which could reflect an acknowledgment of a mistake. Thus, while the res ipsa loquitur instruction was an error, it does not warrant rendering judgment in favor of the appellant due to the existence of some evidence suggesting negligence. Instead, the court will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial based on standard negligence principles without the res ipsa loquitur instruction, giving due consideration to all evidence, including the doctor's own statements about the procedure's rarity and the mistake made."
"On November 15, 1964, a collision occurred at the Lee Street crossing in Midland, Texas, between a Texas and Pacific Railway train and a car driven by plaintiff-appellee Jewell Hoyle. The car belonged to Inez Baker, who had eight children as passengers and was attempting to cross the railroad tracks to make a left turn onto Highway 80 towards Odessa. Baker’s car stalled on the tracks when the line of traffic stopped due to a change in traffic signals. Despite attempts to get help, the car remained stalled for about five to six minutes, with no train in sight initially. As the train approached, Hoyle used his vehicle to bump Baker’s car off the tracks, attempting a rescue. However, amidst this rescue, Hoyle’s car also stalled, and he was struck by the train as he tried to escape from it.

Significant evidence presented during the case included the following:

- Hoyle, in his attempt to rescue Baker and the children, did not act rashly or recklessly according to the jury.
- The engineer, J. H. Johnson, and the fireman aboard the train had a clear and unobstructed view for at least a mile before the collision, and the approach to the crossing was straight and level.
- Johnson testified that he was familiar with the crossing, knew it to be busy, and admitted they were running late.
- Witnesses confirmed that the Baker car was stationary on the tracks several minutes before the train arrived and that it stalled long before the warning lights began flashing.
- McClinton, the fireman, acknowledged that from as far back as the stock pens, he could see cars at the crossing. The stock pens were approximately 3,866 feet east of the crossing.
- Evidence indicated that the train, traveling at 40 miles per hour, could have stopped in time if a proper lookout had been maintained.
- The train crew denied seeing Baker’s car on the tracks and claimed they only saw Hoyle’s car when they were 250 to 350 feet away.
- The jury determined several acts of contributory negligence by Hoyle but also found that his actions were part of a rescue effort, and he did not act in a rash and reckless manner.
- The rescue doctrine was deemed applicable in the case, and the jury made specific findings that supported this doctrine.","The court affirmed the judgment for appellee motorist Jewell Hoyle. The jury's findings determined that the engineer failed to maintain a proper lookout, and this failure was a proximate cause of the accident. Although the jury found Hoyle had committed acts of contributory negligence, these were excused under the rescue doctrine, given that he was attempting to save Baker and the children from imminent peril. This was supported by the jury's findings that Hoyle did not act rashly or recklessly during the rescue. The negligence of the train operators in failing to keep a proper lookout, when they had a clear, unobstructed view for at least a mile from the crossing and knew it was a busy intersection, was a substantial factor leading to the collision. Therefore, the legal standard of care required of Hoyle was reduced due to the sudden emergency of the rescue situation, and any negligence attributed to him was mitigated by the circumstances. The elements of the rescue doctrine were correctly submitted to the jury and supported by evidence with probative force, which leads to the verdict affirming the judgment for Hoyle's personal injuries, medical expenses, and property damage. The court found no merit in the appellant's point that the judgment for medical expenses was incorrect, as the awarded amount was uncontested and the least amount testified in the case, causing no injury to the appellant. Hence, the court found that all of the appellant's points were without merit and affirmed the trial court's decision."
"This case involves a wrongful death and survival action brought by the appellant survivors against the appellee tortfeasor, International Bank of Commerce (IBC), following a deadly collision caused by a detached trailer which struck the vehicle of Jose Trevino. The plaintiffs also included other defendants in their suit - the owner of the trailer, Lightning Laydown, Inc., its manufacturer, Garber Industries/South Texas Tong, Inc., and the driver, David Riley. All parties except IBC settled before trial through a ""Mary Carter"" settlement agreement.

At trial, the jury found that IBC was 5% at fault for the accident due to negligence and that the settling defendants were 95% at fault. The jury identified IBC's conduct as gross negligence—a want of care indicative of a conscious indifference to the safety of others—but did not award exemplary damages, only compensatory damages proportional to IBC's 5% fault, totaling $110,300. The appellants argued that, due to the finding of gross negligence, IBC should be responsible for the entire amount of damages found by the jury, not just the percentage corresponding to its assigned fault. They contended that the trial court incorrectly applied the comparative negligence statute, asserting that the statute did not cover actions based on gross negligence.

The appellate court had to determine whether the comparative negligence statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2212a, applied to the case even though gross negligence was found, and whether gross negligence was a separate cause of action from ordinary negligence that could not be compared for the purposes of reducing damages under the comparative fault framework.","Considering the reasoning set forth in previous relevant Texas cases, such as Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls and Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., the verdict will maintain the application of the comparative negligence statute. The court is likely to uphold the trial court's award of damages based on the percentage of fault allocated to the appellee IBC. The comparative negligence statute allows for tortfeasors' respective fault to be compared, and damages to be apportioned accordingly. The court will argue that one cannot be grossly negligent without being negligent; hence, the underlying finding of negligence permits the application of the comparative negligence statute. The appellants' argument that gross negligence is a separate and distinct cause of action will not be persuasive to the court because under Texas law as iterated in Burk Royalty, gross negligence is considered an elevated form of negligence not entirely different in nature from ordinary negligence.

The court will assert that the differences between negligence and gross negligence are in degree and character and not in kind, relying on the description of gross negligence as ""an entire want of care"" reflecting ""conscious indifference."" Since gross negligence is an aggravated form of negligence, the comparative negligence statute remains pertinent regardless of this aggravated character. The court will also hold that, even assuming the comparative negligence statute was inapplicable, a system of pure comparative causation would yield the same result for appellants' recovery due to principles established in Duncan—which directs that compensation be apportioned among all parties responsible for the injury.

Therefore, the appellate court will reject the appellants' arguments, affirm the judgment of the trial court, and conclude that the comparative negligence statute was properly applied to reduce the appellant survivors' award according to the appellee's percentage of fault. The appellee will not be held liable for damages beyond the 5% fault attributed to them by the jury's findings."
"The plaintiff, A. N. Wright, was awarded workman's compensation benefits by the trial court in Texas due to injuries sustained from inhaling poisonous gas while cleaning out an oil tank in the course of his employment with Storey, Friebele and Duffey. The defendant, Traders & General Insurance Company, was the workman's compensation insurance carrier that appealed the trial court's judgment. The central issue of the case was whether the plaintiff's later development of pneumonia and tuberculosis was a direct result of the lung injury caused by inhaling toxic gas or whether the incapacity was due solely to an existing case of tuberculosis, as argued by the insurance carrier. 

The trial court had concluded that the inhalation of gas was an accidental injury within the meaning of relevant workman's compensation law and had resulted in the plaintiff's lungs being so injured that he subsequently contracted pneumonia and then tuberculosis, and this sequence was a contributing cause of his incapacity. The insurance carrier contended that the plaintiff already had an active case of tuberculosis before the gas inhalation incident and that this pre-existing condition was the sole cause of his incapacity. 

Jury findings included that Wright did not have tuberculosis prior to the incident, the gas inhalation caused his personal injuries on November 21, 1933, which resulted in total incapacity for work, and tuberculosis was not the sole producing cause of plaintiff's incapacity. Evidence presented in court included testimony from medical professionals, the plaintiff's history of performing hard manual labor without issues for fifteen years prior to the incident, and contrarian medical opinions regarding the cause of the plaintiff's condition. The insurance carrier also raised the issue of policy coverage, questioning whether the plaintiff was an employee covered under the applicable insurance policy, as the plaintiff was employed both by Storey, Friebele & Duffey and the Houston & West Texas Oil Company. However, evidence showed the injury occurred while the plaintiff was working on the Cowden lease as an employee of Storey, Friebele & Duffey, thus implying coverage under the policy.","The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, finding no reversible error in their decision. The reasoning is likely to focus on the credibility and substantial weight of the evidence supporting the causal connection between the inhalation of poisonous gas and the plaintiff's subsequent health issues, despite arguments by the defendant insurance carrier. The verdict will consider the jury's determination that these health conditions did not exist prior to the gas inhalation incident and were not the sole cause of incapacity. The evidence will be deemed sufficient to establish that the plaintiff's tuberculosis was a natural result of the injury to his lungs caused by the toxic gas.

The court's affirming judgment will likely highlight that the compensation law defines ""injury"" or ""personal injury"" as harm to the body's physical structure and diseases or infections that naturally result from it, reinforcing the trial court's finding that pneumonia and tuberculosis were not independent intervening diseases but part of the chain of causation initiated by the gas injury. Moreover, prior case law will be cited, reinforcing that a pre-existing disease does not preclude compensation if the work-related injury contributes to the incapacity or death. The testimony of the plaintiff's ability to work prior to the incident and the impact on his capabilities post-exposure will support the causal link and demonstrate the chain of causation.

The insurance carrier's contention on the policy coverage issue will be dismissed, as there will be ample evidence that the plaintiff was an employee of Storey, Friebele & Duffey and that the policy in question did indeed cover the plaintiff's injury. The objections to certain special issues raised by the defendant will be deemed as not having caused surprise or prejudicial effect on the insurance carrier's case, and the objections will be overruled. 

In conclusion, the affirmation of the trial court's judgment will rest upon the consistency between the evidence presented and the jury's verdict that the plaintiff's incapacity was causally linked to the work-related injury and not solely due to the pre-existing tuberculosis condition. The lack of conclusive evidence for the defense's argument regarding the pre-existence and independence of the plaintiff's tubercular infection will be a key factor in the court's decision-making."
"The appellant employer (Farm Products) sought a rehearing for a review of the order of the 145th Judicial District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, after a jury verdict awarded damages to the appellee employee (Stock) for personal injuries sustained while working within the scope of his employment with the appellant. The employee had filed a suit for personal injuries after slipping and falling on grease at work. Appellant contended that the damage award was excessive and raised several points of error regarding the conduct of the trial.

Key details include:
- The employee fell and was injured on grease that was present on the shop floor.
- The employer admitted to a non-delegable duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace.
- There was no direct evidence of who caused the grease spill.
- On the day of the incident, no cleanup crew or employee other than the mechanics were responsible for cleaning the work area, and no one worked in the stall where the employee fell during the previous shift.
- Evidence was presented showing that grease on the floor was not uncommon and that there was not a general policy to clean up between shifts.
- The employee had a rare bone disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which made his bones prone to fracture from mild trauma and his back was generally deformed with multiple old vertebral fractures.
- He had a compression fracture of his second lumbar vertebra (L-2) due to the fall, which caused ongoing pain and disability with no available treatment.
- Before the injury, the employee had a substantial work history, but after the incident, he was unable to work and was terminated due to an inability to perform his duties.
- The jury awarded damages totaling $219,670.","The court on rehearing will affirm the judgment of the lower court, which entered a jury verdict for the appellee employee. The decision will be based on the sufficient evidence presented that supports the jury's findings of the employer's negligence, either through their actions or the actions of their servants, which ultimately led to the employee's injuries. The court will conclude that the grease on the floor constituted a hazard that, under ordinary care, should have been known and removed before the accident occurred. It will be acknowledged that while the appellant employer had a duty to maintain a safe work environment, the presence of grease was not uncommon in such a workplace. However, the absence of policy for cleaning or inspecting the mechanic’s work area between shifts will be considered a failure to exercise ordinary care in maintaining workplace safety.

Furthermore, the court will hold that prejudicial statements made by the appellee's trial counsel do not warrant a reversal of the judgment because the admission of these statements did not impact the findings of the jury. In evaluating the damages awarded, the court will consider the significant personal and economic impact the injury had on the employee, particularly his ongoing pain, loss of earning capacity, and the debilitating and permanent nature of his injury. However, the court will find the amount awarded by the jury to be excessive in light of the evidence provided.

The court, in its discretion, will reform the judgment to reduce the amount of damages awarded to a level that it considers fair and reasonable, taking into account the existing evidence of the employee's pain, suffering, and economic loss, as well as the permanency of his injuries. The reformed amount will still provide substantial compensation to the employee for the injury he sustained. The appellant's request for a reversal will be denied if the appellee agrees to a remittitur of the damages to the amount determined by the court. If the appellee complies with the remittitur, the verdict will stand as reformed; otherwise, a new trial will be ordered."
"Joaquin Garcia was involved in a confrontation inside Club Rodeo, owned by Fifth Club, Inc., with a harasser who was subsequently ejected by Club Rodeo's bouncers. Approximately 45 minutes after the harasser was ejected, Garcia was shot six times in the parking lot by an unknown assailant, who Garcia believed was connected to the earlier altercation. Garcia sued Fifth Club for negligence and gross negligence, failing to provide adequate security at Club Rodeo. He claimed that Fifth Club had a duty to protect him from foreseeable criminal acts due to the nature of its business and the past history of criminal activity at the location.

Evidence included police being summoned over twenty times within the year prior to Garcia’s shooting, with fourteen calls involving violence. This included an aggravated robbery and aggravated assault, which established a pattern of criminal activity at Club Rodeo. Fifth Club was aware of such problems, as indicated by co-owner Salim Salem's deposition. Garcia's security expert pointed to various security shortcomings, including lack of coordination between bouncers and security guards, failure to patrol the parking lot, and inadequate training and surveillance.

Fifth Club filed for a no-evidence summary judgment, arguing there was no evidence of duty, breach, or proximate cause. The trial court granted Fifth Club’s motion without specifying the reason.","For the negligence claim, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision as Garcia has provided sufficient evidence that constitutes more than a scintilla, raising genuine issues of material fact regarding all the essential elements. Firstly, Garcia presented evidence of foreseeable crime, as indicated by the numerous and recent violent incidents reported at Club Rodeo which should have made Fifth Club aware of the potential dangers. This satisfies the foreseeability requirement for both duty and proximate cause, indicating that Fifth Club owed a legal duty to Garcia to protect him from third-party criminal actions.

Moreover, Garcia's expert provided evidence of breach by detailing the failures in Club Rodeo's security measures. For proximate cause, the expert’s opinion demonstrated a connection between Fifth Club’s security lapses and Garcia's injuries, arguing that better security could have either prevented the incident or reduced the resultant harm.

Consequently, the appellate court will find that Garcia has brought forth substantial evidence supporting his claim of negligence on the parts of duty, breach, and proximate cause, warranting a trial to fully explore these factual contentions.

On the other hand, for the gross negligence claim, the appellate court will affirm the lower court's take-nothing judgment because Garcia failed to demonstrate that Fifth Club was subjectively aware of an extreme degree of risk and nevertheless acted with conscious indifference. Gross negligence requires proof of an extreme degree of risk and the Fifth Club’s actual, subjective awareness of the risk, but the evidence doesn't suggest that the prior incidents at Club Rodeo reached the severity necessary to predict that Fifth Club was aware of the extreme risk of shooting and acted with indifference to patrons’ safety.

Hence, the appellate court will conclude that Garcia did not produce evidence satisfying the elements required for gross negligence and will agree with the lower court's decision to reject the gross negligence claim, but will allow the negligence claim to proceed to trial for further examination of the evidence."
"Patient Mary Williford underwent dental treatment with Dr. Richard L. Banowsky and during the procedure, a cut was made in her gum tissue. Williford subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dr. Banowsky for personal injuries she claimed were the result of his negligence during her dental treatment. The trial court instructed a verdict for Dr. Banowsky, essentially concluding the case in his favor without it going to a jury. Williford then appealed the instructed verdict, challenging the need for expert medical testimony to establish negligence and proximate causation. She invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, suggesting that the circumstances implied negligence without needing expert analysis.

Williford argued that her case was of a nature that ordinary negligence rules should apply without the need for medical expert testimony. The incident in question occurred while Dr. Banowsky was preparing Williford’s second bicuspid for a crown. The procedure involved using a high-speed rotary instrument to grind the tooth down to fit the crown, which requires removing enamel below the gum line. During this process, the instrument became entangled with what was described as fibrous material, believed to be either a frenum attachment or mental nerve fibers that were unexpectedly high. Williford did not present an expert witness to testify in her favor, and neither the testimony of Dr. Banowsky nor the deposition from the oral surgeon Dr. Oscar Thompson provided evidence favorable to Williford's claim. Dr. Banowsky testified that the incident was a surprise and was not typical of his previous experiences.

Williford’s claim included suffering such as severe pain, numbness, and a loss of feeling and expression, which she argued would persist into the future. She contended that these injuries were the direct result of negligence particularly attributable to the use of mechanical instruments and the unexpected entanglement of the instrument with the frenum or nerve tissues, positioning the case within the common knowledge of laymen.","The court's reasoning for affirming the directed judgment in favor of Dr. Banowsky will center on the absence of qualified medical testimony to support Williford's legal claims. Since Texas law presumes that a physician has acted properly, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice case must prove, typically with expert medical testimony, that the practitioner's actions were not just a matter of poor judgment but constituted negligence and that such negligence was the proximate cause of injuries. The need for expert testimony can only be disregarded in specific cases where the negligence is apparent to laymen, such as when the wrong part of the body is operated on, or when foreign objects are left in the body post-surgery. 

The court will find that this particular case does not fall under the exception where the common knowledge of laymen is sufficient to establish proof of negligence. The injury sustained by Williford was not obviously indicative of negligence to a non-expert observer. Even though the injuries involved the use of mechanical instruments, the complexity surrounding the procedure and the unforeseen entanglement with abnormal anatomical structures necessitate detailed medical insight to ascertain negligence and causation.

Furthermore, the court will highlight that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is generally inapplicable to medical malpractice cases in Texas, except in cases where negligence is plainly within lay comprehension, which is not the situation here.

In conclusion, based on the lack of substantial evidence of probative force asserting that Dr. Banowsky’s treatment was negligent and causally linked to Williford's injuries, the court will uphold the instructed verdict and confirm that Williford is not entitled to damages from Dr. Banowsky. Therefore, all points of error raised by Williford will be overruled, and the judgment against her will be affirmed."
"Sylvia Morrison underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy performed by Dr. Kathryn Hutton, an employee of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Odessa (TTUHSC), on January 17, 2018. During the surgery, Sylvia sustained an injury to her ureter resulting in urine leakage into her peritoneal cavity. This led to various infections and resulted in her hospitalization at Midland Memorial Hospital on January 29, 2018, for symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, sepsis, acute renal failure, and a high white blood cell count.

Over her 54-day hospital stay, Sylvia was seen by several physicians, including Dr. Hutton, as well as Dr. Nancy Asamoa, Dr. Rachna Bharti, Dr. Hayan Orfaly, Dr. Asif Ansari, Dr. Satish Mocherla, and Dr. John McKenna, and was also under the care of Permian Premier Health Services, Inc. Numerous tests and medical procedures were carried out, but her ureteral injury and subsequent issues remained undiagnosed until March 8, 2018, when a consulting urologist, Dr. Michael Dragun, correctly diagnosed the injury.

Despite the evidence of hydronephrosis on the ultrasound conducted on the day of her admission, and the presence of symptoms like ascites and pleural effusions, none of the physicians, including Dr. Hutton, considered a ureteral injury in their differential diagnosis, which Dr. James Paine, the expert witness, opined should have been included. It was only after weeks of hospitalization that the correct diagnosis was made, and a nephrostomy was performed on March 9, 2018, which allowed Sylvia to improve and eventually be discharged to a rehabilitation and care facility on March 23, 2018.

The appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that their medical expert report was deficient and in granting six separate motions to dismiss Appellants' health care liability claims against seven of the appellees. TTUHSC also filed an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss, claiming a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA).","Regarding the claim against TTUHSC, the court will reverse the trial court's order and will render a judgment of dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity. Appellants failed to plead facts that would establish a waiver of TTUHSC's sovereign immunity based on the use of tangible personal property. Specifically, Appellants did not allege a condition or use of tangible real or personal property in their pleadings, which is necessary to demonstrate a waiver under Section 101.021(2) of the TTCA. The claims against TTUHSC are purely of non-use, which is insufficient to waive sovereign immunity. No revision of factual details or pleadings could change this.

Regarding the remaining Appellees, the court will find that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motions to dismiss based on the adequacy of Appellants' expert reports. Dr. James Paine's expert reports will be deemed as having made a good faith effort to comply with the Texas Medical Liability Act's requirements and will provide a fair summary of his opinion on the causal relationship between the defendants' breaches of the applicable standard of care and Sylvia Morrison's injuries. Dr. Paine's qualifications to render an opinion on the standard of care in this case will be upheld based on his extensive experience and knowledge in managing and caring for hysterectomy patients and diagnosing common postoperative complications, such as Sylvia's ureteral injury.

Furthermore, Dr. Paine's reports will be sufficient in articulating a standard of care, explaining how each respective Appellee breached that standard, and demonstrating a causal relationship between the Appellees' failure to meet the standard of care and the injuries suffered by Sylvia Morrison. As a result, the dismissal of claims against Permian Premier Health Services, and Doctors Asamoa, McKenna, Mocherla, Orfaly, Ansari, and Bharti will be reversed, and those claims will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the appellate court.

The court will rule accordingly, restoring the Appellants' claims against the individual medical professionals and Permian while affirming the dismissal of claims against TTUHSC due to sovereign immunity."
"Respondents Edward J. Klein and others engaged in a legal dispute with petitioner Aetna Insurance Company, seeking to recover damages for their building that was allegedly damaged by lightning. They claimed the building was covered by an insurance policy worth $40,000. The jury found the damage amounted to $20,000 and judgment was entered in favor of the respondents for this sum. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld the trial court's judgment. However, the insurance policy itself was not presented as evidence during the trial, leaving an unclear record on whether the omission was accidental or intentional. While petitioner—the insurer—admitted to issuing a policy covering fire, lightning, and other hazards which was in force at the time of the alleged loss, there was no proof or testimony introduced to establish the coverage amount promised under the contract.

The respondents tried to address the lack of direct proof of the coverage amount by using various procedural methods. They argued that by pleading a coverage amount and not having the insurer plead a lesser sum as an avoidance under Tex. R. Civ. P. 94, the insurer forfeited its right to contest the amount of coverage. Additionally, they suggested that the necessary proof was supplied during cross-examination or by the admission into evidence of a sworn proof of loss they executed. However, the proof of loss form had notations made by the respondents indicating coverage of $40,000.00. Despite petitioner's stance that no proper proof of loss had been furnished according to policy requirements, the trial court admitted this form without objection from the petitioner, viewing it as a compliance with policy conditions, not as confirmation of the policy amount.","The court will overturn the judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and the trial court and remand the case for a new trial. The reasoning for this decision hinges on the respondents' failure to establish by proof or admission the material fact of the insurance policy's coverage amount. Rule 94, requiring affirmative pleading of avoidance, will not be interpreted to include the insurer's responsibility to contradict coverage amounts in the respondents' claim. The lack of direct evidence regarding the coverage amount cannot be waived away using procedural technicalities.

The court will not accept the notion that the coverage amount was proven by inference during cross-examination—a negative witness response wiped out any such inference. The introduction into evidence of the proof of loss form, though unobjected to, will not be accepted as evidence of the coverage amount due to its nature as ex parte statements from the insured. In general, in Texas law, even unobjected incompetent evidence lacks probative force and thus cannot support a judgment.

A remand for retrial is required in the pursuit of justice since the contractual obligations are derived from the insurance policy itself, not from secondary sources like the proof of loss, and the original policy document should be readily presented as evidence. Therefore, in the absence of concrete proof of the insurer's coverage obligation, the petitioner's prior motion for an instructed verdict should have been granted, and the case must be retried with the correct evidence presented."
"The City of Athens, Texas, operates a water treatment plant near Lake Athens. The plant sits at the top of a hill, sloping towards the lake, from which raw water is drawn for processing. Directly downhill from the plant near the shoreline of Lake Athens live the Residents—the Runnings and Cindy Wilkins—who brought claims against the City and the Athens Municipal Water Authority (AMWA), asserting that releases of water from the plant's Clearwell No. 2 caused flooding that damaged their homes and properties in May 2015, December 2015, and March 2016.

The Residents filed negligence claims under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), state and federal inverse condemnation claims, and alleged violations of the Texas Water Code. The trial court dismissed the Texas Water Code violations and all the claims against AMWA but denied the City's plea to the jurisdiction regarding the negligence and inverse condemnation claims. The City filed a cross-appeal challenging the trial court's order on the grounds of governmental immunity.

As part of the negligence claim under the TTCA, the Residents alleged that the plant's equipment—specifically motor-driven equipment like pumps, valves, and monitoring equipment—was negligently operated or maintained by City employees, leading to the flooding. They submitted that the Clearwell No. 2 check valve became stuck in an open position, causing backflow, and that water pumped from the lake to the plant filters, combined with operator's failure to switch the filters from automatic to manual during a power surge, contributed to the overflow.

In the inverse condemnation claim under the Texas Constitution, the Residents argued that the government knowingly performed acts that caused their property to be damaged for public use, suggesting the City had a longstanding practice of releasing water when Clearwell No. 2 became too full. They also filed a similar federal takings claim under the U.S. Constitution's Just Compensation Clause.","The Residents' expert testimony regarding the cause of the overflow from the water filters provided only a scintilla of evidence—largely based on speculation—and failed to prove that the City's operation of the equipment was the actual cause of the flooding. Therefore, the Trial Court's ruling granting waiver immunity under the TTCA was reversed, as the testimony did not provide a link between the use or operation of motor-driven equipment and the damages suffered by the Residents.

For the inverse condemnation claim under the Texas Constitution, there was no evidence showing that the government knew or was substantially certain that flooding would result from the discharge of water. Claims of intentional releases in the past and conversations with City representatives did not evidence a substantial certainty of harm or demonstrate that the flooding was a necessary result of the City's actions. Hence, based on these facts, the Residents could not establish a viable claim for inverse condemnation under the Texas Constitution, and the City's challenge to jurisdiction was likely to be upheld.

Regarding the federal takings claim, it was contingent on the viability of the state inverse condemnation claim. Since the state claim was deemed nonviable, the federal claim as well was subsumed within it and thus could not stand on its own. The Residents' federal takings claim was likely to be dismissed due to the lack of a viable state claim, confirming the City's assertion in its plea to jurisdiction.

In conclusion, the higher court was poised to reverse the trial court’s denial of the City’s plea to jurisdiction across all counts, concluding that the Residents failed to provide sufficient evidence to waive the City's governmental immunity. The Residents' claims were likely to be dismissed on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and all costs would probably be adjudged against the Residents."
"Appellant motorist, Cuyler, was injured in an automobile accident with appellee employee driver, Bennett, who was employed by Lone Star Veterinary Supply Company, Inc., and acquired by McKesson Corporation. On August 19, 1985, as Cuyler braked suddenly for the driver in front of her, Bennett attempted to avoid collision but still bumped Cuyler's vehicle, causing minor visible damage. Both parties subsequently focused on the question of damages. Cuyler contended her injuries were caused by the accident, evidenced by subsequent medical issues and a loss of income. However, Bennett and Lone Star argued her injuries were due to pre-existing conditions and other accidents. In the trial court, the jury found Bennett negligent but did not award Cuyler future damages. They awarded damages for past physical pain and mental anguish, and for past medical care, but none for loss of earning capacity, ongoing physical impairment, or future medical care.

The trial court's judgment was such that Cuyler was to recover $5,000 plus prejudgment interest and costs from Bennett, taking nothing from Lone Star or McKesson. Cuyler's objections were overruled, including those regarding Lone Star's liability, the capacity of Bennett as an employee at the time of the accident, and irregularities in the jury's findings. She also argued that the trial court failed to include instructions and definitions needed for the jury and that the damages awarded did not reflect the undisputed facts of the case.","The trial court's judgment awarding damages to appellant, Cuyler, for her personal injury claim against appellee employee driver, Bennett, will be affirmed, along with the take-nothing judgment against appellee employer, Lone Star. The denial of the capacity of principal for employee driver Bennett by appellee employer, Lone Star, did not require a verified pleading, aligning with established rules that agency relationships do not need denial in verified pleadings.

The court will find that the jury's verdict on damages was not against the weight of the evidence due to the presented evidence of appellant Cuyler's pre-existing medical condition and involvement in other accidents. It will be determined that the jury's answers regarding whether Bennett was acting as an employee of Lone Star and McKesson at the time of the accident and whether he was in the scope of his employment are not inconsistent, as the scope of employment completely encompasses the inquiry into Bennett’s employee status.

Regarding damages, the argument that Cuyler’s pre-existing medical conditions did not lessen the liability of the defendant will be considered in the context of the jury being instructed properly to award Cuyler all damages proximately caused by Bennett’s negligence. The judgment against Bennett will not differ regardless of the agency status of employment since the damages are compensatory for the actual injury suffered by Cuyler. Moreover, Lone Star’s failure to file a verified pleading, specifically denying liability, will be seen as not a reversible error due to it concerning mistaken legal capacity and not an agency relationship.

The court will order a reformation of the judgment to award prejudgment interest reflecting the correct period for computing prejudgment interest from six months after the occurrence of the incident, beginning December 18, 1987, to the date of the judgment, June 30, 1991, at a rate of 10 percent per year, according to the applicable rules and statutes governing the awarding of prejudgment interest. 

Any further contentions by Cuyler, such as errors in jury instructions regarding pre-existing medical conditions, the definition of mental anguish, or presumptions arising from nonproduction of evidence, will be overruled based on reasonings that the court's charge adequately confined the jury's considerations to damages directly resulting from the defendant's negligence, and that the term ""mental anguish"" does not necessitate definition as a legal term. Furthermore, any claims concerning prejudice due to nonproduction of documents will not succeed as they did not likely cause an improper judgment given the jury's findings. 

In conclusion, since the evidence supported the jury's findings, demonstrated no conflicting answers on material facts, and justified the damages awarded, the trial court’s judgment will be affirmed with the noted interest adjustments."
"Ollis Kirk and Josephine Wittner, appellee employees, were exposed to asbestos-containing products while employed at Alabama shipyards and subsequently developed asbestos-related diseases. They sued Keene Corporation and others, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and products liability. Following a jury trial, the appellees were awarded $100,000 each in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 each in punitive damages. 

Keene Corporation appealed the verdict, arguing that the trial court made several errors: improper definitions of ""proximate cause"" and ""unreasonably dangerous"" were submitted to the jury, ""wantonness"" was submitted as an independent theory of recovery, cross-examination of an expert witness was improperly limited, and punitive damages awarded violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Keene Corporation challenged the trial court's definition of ""proximate cause"" for omitting the element of foreseeability, and in the definition of ""unreasonably dangerous,"" they argued that it applied only to manufacturing-defect theory and not to marketing-defect or failure-to-warn theory, which was relevant to the case. Moreover, Keene Corporation contested the punitive damages arguing their repetitive awards for the same conduct was unconstitutional and violated due process. They pointed out their liability for a significant amount in punitive damages from various asbestos cases.","The appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellee employees. The arguments regarding the definitions of ""proximate cause"" and ""unreasonably dangerous"" will be found without merit because the definitions submitted were consistent with Alabama law and adequately provided the jury with the standard needed for their deliberation. The foreseeability element, although not explicitly stated, will be found to be implicit in the phrase “natural and probable sequence of events.”

In the matter of the court limiting cross-examination of Dr. Joseph K. Wagoner, the court will find no abuse of discretion. It will be determined that the trial court did not err in excluding criticism of the expert's past research as it was not shown to be directly relevant to the case at hand, and there was no adverse ruling on this evidence's admissibility.

Regarding punitive damages, the appellate court will reject Keene Corporation's due process arguments. It will be held that punitive damages can legally be assessed for each party entitled and that the awards in this case did not exceed amounts necessary to punish and deter future misconduct. The awards were in line with the jury's prerogative to punish for the reprehensibility of the defendant's actions and to deter similar future conduct. The contention that punitive damages were excessive or unconstitutional will be deemed unpersuasive as punitive damages are intended to set an example and serve societal interest in retribution and deterrence, and no appellate court precedent exists that repetitive awards of punitive damages for the same conduct violate due process.

In conclusion, all of Keene Corporation's points of error will be overruled, including the handling of jury instructions, limitations on cross-examination, and the upholding of punitive damage awards. The appellate court will find that the trial court acted within its discretion and followed the appropriate legal standards, and thus the appellee employees' awards will be upheld."
"Donna Rauner purchased a mattress and box spring from the Lewisville Sam's Club, where an employee tied both items to the roof of her Jeep Cherokee. Though the employee testified to advising Rauner not to exceed 35 miles per hour and to avoid major roads, Rauner claimed she received no such warning. Upon entering the Interstate 35 and reaching a speed of roughly 40 miles per hour, the mattress and box spring came loose, falling onto the highway—one on or near the right shoulder, the other between the center and left lanes.

Rauner stopped and called for help. Meanwhile, several vehicles managed to avoid the obstacles. Bevin Spence Cooper, alongside a co-worker, noticed the items and Rauner while traveling on the same interstate. Cooper parked in a nearby lot and ran across the service road and medians to the scene. As he attempted to drag the box spring across the lanes, he was struck by Tory Taylor's car, resulting in severe injuries to Cooper.

Cooper filed a negligence lawsuit against Taylor, Rauner, and Wal-Mart (operating the Sam's Club). The trial court denied Wal-Mart's motion for an instructed verdict, leading the jury to find Taylor, Rauner, Wal-Mart, and Cooper equally responsible for the accident, attributing 33 percent of the responsibility to each, except Taylor, who was deemed 1 percent responsible. Subsequently, Wal-Mart's motion for judgement notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) was also denied, and judgment was rendered based on the verdict.","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment against Wal-Mart. The reversal will be due to a lack of sufficient evidence to establish proximate cause with respect to Wal-Mart's actions. Despite potentially accepting that Wal-Mart had a duty of care and may have been negligently responsible for the mattress and box spring coming loose from Rauner's vehicle, the link between Wal-Mart's actions and Cooper's injuries will not be seen as direct enough to satisfy the elements of proximate cause, which includes both cause in fact and foreseeability.

In this case, the causal chain connecting the original negligent act (improperly securing the mattress) with the resulting injury (Cooper being struck by a vehicle) will be viewed as too attenuated. The intervening actions of Cooper—running from a distant parking lot to the accident site and attempting to retrieve the box spring without caution—will be seen as separate from the influence of Wal-Mart's original negligence. Cooper's decision to enter the highway to attempt a rescue will be considered unforeseeable by Wal-Mart, breaking the causal nexus required for proximate cause.

Even if the rescue doctrine applies, which generally holds that a rescuer injured while aiding a victim in danger due to someone else's negligence can claim against the negligent party, it will still require the establishment of proximate cause. Therefore, Wal-Mart's negligence will not be considered a proximate cause of Cooper's injuries. The trial court's error in not instructing a verdict or rendering judgement n.o.v. in favor of Wal-Mart will be recognized, leading to the appellate court's directive that Cooper take nothing from Wal-Mart. The judgement will be rendered in Wal-Mart's favor because proximate cause is a fundamental element of negligence that Cooper will be seen as having failed to sufficiently prove against Wal-Mart."
"The appellant, Raquel Greene, underwent two simultaneous surgeries performed by appellee physicians, Dr. Michelle Thiet and Dr. Matilda Perkins. The procedures were abdominoplasty, liposuction, and cholecystectomy. Greene had previously been turned away for the cosmetic surgeries due to her weight but later returned when she required a cholecystectomy, requesting that the cosmetic procedures be performed at the same time. Both Dr. Thiet and Dr. Perkins agreed to the combined surgeries. Greene was informed about the risks associated with each surgery individually and also the slightly increased risk of complications from concurrent abdominal operations. She consented to the surgeries regardless.

The surgeries were completed within the time frame normally expected for abdominoplasty and liposuction alone. Post-surgery, Greene suffered complications including necrosis that led to additional medical procedures, including three debridements and a skin graft. Greene acknowledged that necrosis is a recognized complication of the surgeries she underwent and could occur in the absence of any negligence.

Greene filed a lawsuit against the physicians, initially including a claim of traditional negligence in performing the surgeries but subsequently amended her pleadings to only claim lack of informed consent. She alleged that if she had been informed of the increased risk of performing both surgeries simultaneously, she would not have consented to both. Her affidavit contained her lay opinion, with no expert testimony to support her claims.

The physicians moved for summary judgment, contending that the evidence showed that the combination of surgeries performed within the normal time frame for one surgery did not cause the injury. This motion was granted by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court.","The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellee physicians. The reasoning for this verdict will be that the appellee physicians successfully negated the causation component of Greene's informed consent claim by showing that the surgeries, performed in the normal time frame for one surgery, did not cause the necrosis. It will be further noted that there was no expert testimony from Greene to sufficiently raise an issue of fact with respect to the causation component negated by the physicians' summary judgment evidence. In the absence of competent expert controverting evidence on the issue of causation, Greene's personal affidavit will not be considered sufficient to create an issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.

The verdict will likely emphasize the requirement that in informed consent cases, a plaintiff must establish not only that a reasonable person would have refused the treatment if fully informed of all inherent risks but also that the plaintiff was injured by the occurrence of the risks of which they were not informed. Greene's failure to meet this ""but for"" or ""sine qua non"" standard of causation, which would require expert testimony demonstrating that the injury would not have occurred but for the physicians' failure to disclose the combined risks, will be pivotal in affirming the summary judgment. The predicted outcome is that the appellate court will hold the physicians met their burden by negating causation, and Greene did not present sufficient controverting evidence to survive summary judgment."
"Seitel Data, Ltd. (the company) entered into a contract to conduct seismic testing on property owned by the Ralph Simmons and Laura Angela Simmons Family Living Trust (the owners) in Shelby County, Texas. The owners ran a chicken growing operation that required significant water usage, provided through two productive water wells and a city water line for backup. Shortly after the company completed seismic testing, one of the water wells failed. The owners sued the company for damages, claiming the well failure was caused by the seismic testing which involved underground explosions. The owners presented testimony from both Ralph and Laura Simmons and a well driller but did not provide an expert on seismic testing. The company chose not to call any witnesses. The trial before a jury resulted in the owners being awarded damages under breach of contract and tort theories, with the owners electing to recover under contract theory.

The contract claimed that the company would be liable for damages resulting from seismic operations. The owners and the well driller testified about the close temporal relationship between the seismic testing and the well's failure, providing evidence of sand and mud production by the well, excessive filter changes, overheating, and the need to drill a new well. There was also evidence of two nearby property owners with wells who experienced similar issues post-testing. Despite the testimony, the company argued on appeal that the lack of evidence from an expert seismologist left insufficient proof that their testing caused the damage.","The appeal court will likely focus on the sufficiency of evidence to prove causation, given the company’s request for reversal based on a ""no evidence"" standpoint rather than a factual sufficiency review. Seitel's argument that expert testimony is mandatory to prove it breached the contract will not convince the court. The court will find that the necessity for expert testimony regarding the effects of seismic testing, particularly on water wells, depends on the complexity of the given case. In situations where the connection between an event and the damage is straightforward enough to be within a layperson's understanding, expert testimony will not be deemed necessary.

The court will opine that jurors are capable of employing common sense to draw a conclusion about the causal relationship between the seismic testing and rapid well failure. The temporal and physical proximity of testing and well problems, along with the experiences of neighboring property owners, will be deemed sufficient to establish a strong and logical connection justifying the jury's verdict. The court will assert that just as people can understand certain natural phenomena without detailed scientific explanations, they can also reasonably conclude that ground vibrations strong enough to remove a plaque from a wall can likewise disrupt underground geological formations to cause sand infiltration into a well.

However, the jury's award of appellate attorney's fees will be reversed due to insufficient evidence presented on this aspect at trial. Since attorney's fees must be supported by competent evidence and the owners offered no proof of expected appellate attorney fees, this portion of the judgment cannot stand.

In summary, the appellate court will modify the judgment to remove the award of appellate attorney fees but will affirm the judgment as modified, upholding the jury’s findings on causation and damage awards based on the lay testimony and circumstantial evidence provided at trial."
"Howard Ragland, doing business as Lightning Laydown, was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy by Mt. Hawley Insurance Company with limits of $300,000. On March 11, 1985, a trailer rig being towed by a Lightning Laydown employee became detached, crossed into oncoming traffic, and caused an accident that resulted in the death of Jose Trevino. The Trevino family filed a lawsuit in Travis County against Lightning Laydown seeking $65 million in damages, alleging negligence on the part of Ragland's employees. General Accident Insurance Company defended Ragland without reservation of rights.

Ragland subsequently notified Mt. Hawley of the lawsuit and requested a defense, which Mt. Hawley denied, citing policy exclusions and the claim falling outside the covered policy hazards. The Trevino claim eventually settled, and Ragland entered into a Mary Carter agreement with the Trevinos, requiring payment of $300,000, less any recovery from International Bank of Commerce, another defendant. The jury found several parties, including Lightning Laydown, to be negligent and awarded the Trevinos $110,300 to be paid by the International Bank of Commerce.

Ragland, with the proceeds assigned from General Accident, pursued a legal claim against Mt. Hawley for failing to defend and indemnify him in the Trevino case, asserting multiple causes of action, including breach of contract and duty of good faith and fair dealing. Mt. Hawley answered with a general denial. Ragland then filed a motion to strike Mt. Hawley's answer due to non-compliance with the financial responsibility requirement, under article 1.36, § 11(a) of the Texas Insurance Code. The court ordered Mt. Hawley to post a $2,000,000 bond by a given deadline, which Mt. Hawley failed to do, leading to an interlocutory default judgment against them.

The case went to a jury to determine damages, resulting in a jury verdict for Ragland including $4,000,000 in exemplary damages and one-third of Ragland's recovery as attorney's fees. Mt. Hawley contended that the financial responsibility requirement did not apply to them and argued against the damages award on several grounds, including challenges to the award of exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and the exclusion of evidence regarding General Accident's payment of claims.","The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. 

Mt. Hawley, as a surplus lines insurer, will be considered as an ""unauthorized insurer"" under Texas law, making the financial responsibility requirement applicable to them. Their failure to post the required bond will be deemed justifiable grounds for the court to strike their pleadings and render a default judgment. It will be argued that Mt. Hawley had constructive notice of their responsibilities under Texas law and made no efforts to file the required bond even after their answer was struck. Therefore, the trial court did not err.

Regarding the actual and exemplary damages awarded, the court will find that the default judgment and stipulations suffice to establish Ragland's actual damages incurred due to Mt. Hawley's breach of contract and duty of good faith and fair dealing. The collateral source rule will apply, since Mt. Hawley was not privy to Ragland's contract with General Accident. Consequently, Mt. Hawley should not benefit from the payments General Accident made on Ragland's behalf.

As for the one-third attorney's fees awarded, evidence deemed the fee usual, customary, and reasonable, supporting the award. The submission of attorney's fees as a percentage of the recovery is not improper as long as it is proved to be a reasonable fee, which in this case, has been.

Finally, Ragland's jury arguments will be considered permissible as inferences drawn from evidence presented at trial, and even if not, they likely did not cause rendition of an improper judgment. As none of Mt. Hawley's points of error will be sustained, the court's decision will be to affirm the trial court's judgment awarding damages to Ragland."
"Willie J. Hardy, owner of Sunset Valley Mobile Home Park, had employed John Smith as a maintenance man since September 2015. John, like other residents, also lived at the park. Tasha Ernest Douglas, along with her husband Francisco ""Frank"" Douglas and other family members, were tenants at the park. Tasha fell behind on rent, and on December 8, 2015, an eviction notice was issued. Subsequent meetings to resolve the rent issue between Hardy, Tasha, Frank, and John led to an agreement for Tasha to vacate by December 16, although due to Tasha's hospitalization, moving out was delayed.

On December 18, 2015, Tasha finished moving out and told John that Frank had the keys. After Frank returned from work, he and Tasha went to return the keys to John. John had been drinking since early in the day. A confrontation occurred in which John, angered by their presence, shot and killed Frank. John Smith was later convicted of Frank's murder in a criminal trial. Tasha and others filed a civil suit against Hardy, claiming negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention, as well as wrongful death and survival claims based on negligence and premises liability theories, seeking exemplary damages.

Hardy filed for summary judgment, stating that there was no evidence of proximate causation on the plaintiffs' claims and that John's criminal act of murder was not foreseeable. The trial court granted the summary judgment, which was appealed by the appellants. The appellants claimed that Hardy had failed to sufficiently identify the essential element he challenged, contesting the summary judgment's appropriateness.","The trial court's summary judgment in favor of Hardy was affirmed. It was determined that at the time of John's previous discriminatory statements in September 2015, it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would commit murder months later during a disagreement over the return of keys. Imposing a duty on Hardy in these circumstances would make the employer an insurer against highly unpredictable events and would impose too great a burden on the employer-employee relationship. There was no evidence that Hardy's actions as a landowner caused the tenants' damages under their claims. No special duties were given to John that involved carrying a firearm or performing security, and there was no evidence Hardy knew of John's firearm. Thus, Hardy's hiring and supervision of John were not proximate causes of the incident, nor were John's later unforeseeable actions foreseeable based on his job.

Moreover, no duty by Hardy was established since there was no evidence of recent, similar crimes near the mobile home park that would have made future crimes foreseeable. Hardy was also not present during the altercation and had no direct knowledge of an imminent confrontation. John's previous comments did not amount to imminent conflict knowledge for Hardy. Thus, Hardy owed no general duty to the appellants as invitees to inspect, warn, or prevent against the dangers associated with John's individual actions.

Evidentiary complaints raised by the appellants were also dismissed, as Hardy's burden was not to establish entitlement to the summary judgment but rather the appellants' burden to produce evidence to create a factual issue. Even without Hardy's affidavit, the appellants failed to show Hardy owed a legal duty or that proximate cause was established between Hardy's actions and the criminal conduct resulting in Frank's death. Therefore, all appellants' issues were overruled, and the trial court's decision was upheld."
"On August 16, 2001, James Hicks joined an offshore fishing trip on the M/V LADY ANNA, owned and operated by Captain Elliott's Party Boats, Inc., along with his brother-in-law, Kenneth Carter, and his friend, Benjamin T. Smith. Captain Steven Odstrcil and two other crew members were operating the vessel that day. The trip left Freeport, Texas at 6:00 a.m. By 10:45 a.m., Hicks became ill, showing symptoms including vomiting, sweating, weakness, and a pale complexion. Initially, the crew thought Hicks was seasick and did not provide immediate extensive care. His condition deteriorated, and by 11:45 a.m. he was incoherent and lacked a heartbeat. CPR was administered by a crew member and passenger. Captain Odstrcil contacted the U.S. Coast Guard, and Hicks was airlifted, but he was pronounced dead upon arrival at a medical facility. His death was due to a heart attack caused by cardiovascular disease.

Sheila Hicks, James's wife, filed a wrongful death and survival action against Captain Elliott's Party Boats, alleging negligence in failing to provide care, respond appropriately to James's condition, and provide medical treatment. The company filed for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, citing DOSHA preemption and asserting Sheila presented no evidence of negligence. On January 21, 2005, the motions were filed and on March 28, 2005, the summary judgment was granted in favor of Captain Elliott's Party Boats. Sheila then filed a motion for a new trial, which was also denied.

In appeal, Sheila contended that she presented evidence addressing all negligence claim elements. She submitted affidavits from Smith and Captain Richard L. Frenzel, highlighting the inadequacy of the crew's response and breach of care standards. Dr. George Burnazian's affidavit suggested that the crew's earlier intervention could have greatly increased Hicks's survival chances. However, this fell short of establishing a causal link between the actions of Captain Elliott’s crew and Hicks's death. Dr. Burnazian filed a supplemental affidavit with Sheila's motion for a new trial, postulating that the crew's failure to render aid was likely a significant factor in Hicks's death.","The appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision to grant a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Captain Elliott's Party Boats. The court will reason that Sheila did not provide sufficient evidence to raise a material fact issue regarding proximate cause, focusing on the test for cause-in-fact, which requires the circumstance that the act or omission was a substantial factor in causing the injury that would not have occurred otherwise. Despite the affidavits submitted by Sheila, she will be seen as failing to present more than a scintilla of evidence that Captain Elliott’s actions or inactions were the cause-in-fact of her husband's death. This deficiency will be crucial as it undermines her ability to establish the proximate cause element of her negligence claim.

Regarding the trial court's denial of Sheila's motion for a new trial, the appellate court will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion since Dr. Burnazian’s supplemental affidavit, filed with the motion, was not presented at the time the trial court granted summary judgment, thus it could not have been considered. The court will determine that evidence presented post-summary judgment cannot factor into the appeal and that Sheila's third issue regarding the denial of the motion for a new trial will also be overruled. The reasoning will focus on the procedural aspect that the record as it stood at the time of the summary judgment ruling is the basis for review, and additional evidence introduced later cannot be considered. The final verdict will be guided by examining the sufficiency of cause-in-fact and foreseeability without delving into post-judgment submissions."
"Cecilia Tix Smith was the insured party under an accident insurance policy issued by the appellee insurer, promising to pay $10,000.00 if her death resulted directly and independently from bodily injury caused by an accident while she was using an automobile. On December 11, 1959, Smith died from acute heart failure while in her car after an incident where her vehicle's back bumper locked with another car's bumper. This mishap required physical and emotional effort to disengage, including assistance from others. The appellant executor argued that her death was caused by the resultant bodily injuries from this accident.

Mrs. Smith was 66 and had a history of serious health issues, including a bad heart condition which meant she could die at any point from minimal exertion or stress, and cancer with continuing treatment effects impacting her lung and heart function. She took various medications for her heart and had previously been advised to acquire a car with power steering to reduce physical strain, which she had not done.

Dr. McLarty, her long-time physician, had treated her for both conditions and testified regarding both her health struggles leading up to the incident and the details of the event as the precipitating cause of her death. Dr. Thoma, who conducted the autopsy, agreed that her compromised cardiac status likely made the impact and exertion of the bumper incident sufficient to precipitate acute cardiac failure. 

The trial court concluded that the proximate cause of death was heart disease and not the accidental bodily injuries, citing that opinion testimony on causation was not binding and the death certificate did not mention an accident or injury causing death. The appellant executor argued on appeal that the death was accidental and directly caused by the bumper incident, independent of her heart disease.","The court will affirm the take-nothing judgment entered against the appellant executor, based on the standpoint that the proximate cause of the decedent's death was her pre-existing heart disease. While there was testimony from doctors that the stress and physical exertion from the car bumper incident was the precipitating cause of the cardiac failure, this is countered by evidence and opinion suggesting that Smith's severe heart condition was of such a nature that even minimal strain could be fatal. Hence, the incident can be viewed as merely the occasion of her death rather than its direct and independent cause.

Moreover, the court will likely note that Dr. McLarty's death certificate did not indicate exertion as the cause of death, which is prima facie evidence of the cause of death. Opinion evidence regarding causation, even when provided by medical experts, does not compel acceptance by the trier of fact, especially when other testimonial portions contradict or weaken the stance that the incident was the sole precipitating cause.

Given the policy's condition of liability contingent upon death resulting directly and independently from bodily injury due to an accident, the court will focus on determining the proximate cause of death. Considering the extent of pre-existing heart and lung conditions, the test will be whether the car incident and resulting exertion and stress were proximate or merely incidental to, or a remote cause of, the fatality.

It will be concluded that the evidence supports a finding that Smith's heart disease was the primary, proximate cause of death and that any injuries sustained during the bumper incident were incidental or at most aggravating factors to her pre-existing condition rather than direct causes. Thus, the insurer's obligation to pay under the policy will not arise, as the death did not result directly and independently from bodily injuries by an accident."
"In May 2016, Comfort Agara took her 2009 Mercedes to Mercedes-Benz of Clear Lake (""MBCL"") for a check because her check engine light was on. MBCL performed a ""limited courtesy vehicle inspection,"" during which they checked and passed the power steering fluid level, power steering condition, and power locking system operation. The mechanic found other problems, like worn brakes, fog lights, and centrifuge cover issues, and recommended replacing bald rear tires. Agara authorized repairs only to her brakes and centrifuge cover. After collecting her vehicle and driving onto the Interstate Highway 45 in light rain, Agara lost the ability to steer, resulting in an accident causing her severe injuries. Subsequent investigation found low power steering fluid and hard steering, with a cited cause of fluid loss potentially due to collision impact. An officer post-accident cited her for unsafe driving speed for conditions.

Agara sued MBCL for negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, and gross negligence. She claimed MBCL failed to service and inspect the power steering system properly, contributing to her loss of control. MBCL denied all allegations, arguing responsible factors included Agara's worn tires, excessive speed, and weather conditions.

MBCL moved for a no-evidence summary judgment and traditional summary judgment, suggesting no evidence supported the claims especially relating to the cause of the accident. Agara argued MBCL's service immediately prior to the accident was substantially related to the cause and cited inspection reports pre- and post-accident, her testimony, and proximity in time between service and the accident as support.

The trial court granted MBCL's no-evidence and traditional summary-judgment motions, and after denying her motion for a new trial, the case was appealed by Agara. She contested only the negligence and breach of warranty dismissals, not gross negligence.","The court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of MBCL. In analyzing the negligence claim, the verdict will focus on the lack of proximate cause evidence to link MBCL's actions or inactions with the accident. The court requires that Agara demonstrate that MBCL's breach was a substantial factor in causing her injuries, which necessitates more than speculative or conjectural assertions based on the timing of the maintenance service and the ensuing accident. Despite the temporal proximity, the court will find no substantial evidence showing MBCL's inspection or lack thereof was the actual reason for the steering failure.

Additionally, the court will acknowledge other factors, such as weather conditions, worn-out tires, and Agara’s admission of hydroplaning, which support the assessment that MBCL's responsibility for the accident is not sufficiently substantiated. Furthermore, expert testimony discrediting the link between loss of power steering fluid and the inability to steer will further dilute her causation argument.

Regarding the breach of express and implied warranties claim, Agara will fail to prove that MBCL breached any warranties that could have led to her injuries. The court will reference that MBCL's inspection indicated the passed condition of the power steering system and that Agara herself felt the car was running smoothly post-service. The lack of evidence countering MBCL's inspection findings and the post-accident reports suggesting the fluid loss may have resulted from the collision will persuade the court that no warranty breach occurred.

Consequently, the court's reasoning will lead to the affirmation of the lower court's summary judgment dismissal of Agara's claims for negligence and breach of express and implied warranties."
"Charlcie Pink, widow of the decedent Veryl L. Pink, maintained a lawsuit against Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear) and several product suppliers, including Texaco Refining & Marketing, Inc. (Texaco), alleging that her husband's renal cell carcinoma was caused by exposure to benzene during his employment at Goodyear from approximately 1963 to 1997. Following Veryl Pink's death in 2005, the 172nd District Court in Jefferson County, Texas, granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Goodyear and a take-nothing judgment in favor of Texaco. The lawsuit against Texaco was voluntarily discontinued by the widow in trial court. The company had a duty to provide a safe workplace under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 411.103 (2006). The treating oncologist, Dr. Mahesh Kanojia, submitted an affidavit stating that the cause of Mr. Pink's renal cell carcinoma was probably exposure to benzene. The affidavit cited materials he consulted, including Mr. Pink's medical records, deposition testimony of Mr. Pink and co-workers, and scientific literature. Goodyear filed objections to the reliability of the oncologist's affidavit based on Borg-Warner Corporation v. Flores and Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, arguing that it lacked the necessary analysis to establish a causal link between benzene exposure and the cancer. The trial court did not expressly rule on the reliability objections or conduct a hearing under Tex. R. Evid. 104(a) concerning this matter.","The appellate court affirmed the judgment as to the claim against Texaco because the widow had voluntarily discontinued the lawsuit against Texaco at the trial level, and therefore, could not raise objections for the first time on appeal. However, the court reversed the summary judgment as to Goodyear, since Pink produced some evidence supporting the elements of her claim against Goodyear. The court opined that the treating oncologist's opinion was not conclusory as a matter of law because it referenced the materials consulted. Without an express ruling on the reliability of Dr. Kanojia's causation opinion, his affidavit remained part of the summary judgment proof, providing some evidence against the no-evidence motion for summary judgment on causation. The court will not consider Goodyear's reliability objections as implicitly sustained by the trial court due to the absence of a hearing on this issue under Rule 104(a). The case was remanded for further proceedings, as the necessary process missing was a hearing under Tex. R. Evid. 104(a) to examine the reliability of the evidence provided by Dr. Kanojia. The appellate court anticipated that the trial court may decide whether the expert's affidavit must be stricken due to unreliable foundational data, methodology, or technique, or may allow the opportunity to obtain additional evidence to support the claims. In conclusion, without a clear express ruling that the treating oncologist's causation opinion is unreliable, the reverse and remand decision is justified."
"On February 2, 2007, Geoffrey Dugger went to Joel Martinez's house. Martinez put ""cheese"" (black-tar heroin and Tylenol PM) in his pocket, and they later purchased tequila and a cigar, filled it with marijuana to make a ""blunt,"" and returned to Dugger’s residence. They consumed tequila, snorted cheese, and smoked marijuana. Martinez fell asleep, began vomiting, and made choking sounds. Dugger yelled for his parents but did not call 911 immediately. Instead, Dugger contacted Martinez's mother, Mary Ann Arredondo, telling her that Martinez had been drinking and was vomiting; she suggested letting him sleep it off. Fifteen minutes later, Dugger's father called 911. Despite emergency services' efforts, Martinez died. The police and paramedics were not informed of the heroin ingestion. Arredondo sued Dugger for wrongful death, claiming negligence due to the delay in calling 911 and not revealing the heroin use. Dugger asserted the common law ""unlawful acts doctrine,"" which traditionally barred a plaintiff's recovery if engaged in an illegal act contributing to their injury, as an affirmative defense. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dugger. The court of appeals reversed, stating that the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 93.001 superseded the common law doctrine. The Supreme Court of Texas reviewed the continued applicability of the unlawful acts doctrine given the state's proportionate responsibility scheme and § 93.001, which provides an affirmative defense for civil actions regarding personal injury or death when the plaintiff was committing a felony leading to final conviction and such felony was the sole cause of damages, or when the plaintiff was committing or attempting suicide.","The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. It held that the common law ""unlawful acts doctrine"" does not coexist with the proportionate responsibility scheme under Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which suggests that a plaintiff's unlawful conduct, not covered by an expressly stated statutory affirmative defense, should be apportioned rather than bars recovery completely. The court interpreted that the statute § 93.001 reinstates a limited portion of the unlawful acts doctrine to bar recovery solely under specific circumstances articulated within the statute – when there is a final felony conviction or commission/attempt of suicide attributable solely to cause the plaintiff's damages. The adoption of this proportionate responsibility framework has supplanted former doctrines, including the unlawful acts doctrine, as a complete bar to recovery. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was incorrect in applying the unlawful acts doctrine to grant summary judgment for Dugger. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

"The appellant, Donald Streich, was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease, leading to the insertion of a Schon catheter by Dr. Ruben Lopez on November 3, 1999, at Valley Baptist Medical Center for dialysis purposes. Dr. Joseph Dougherty, a nephrologist, took over his care, and Streich was discharged on November 5, 1999. Streich was readmitted on November 6, 1999, with fever and chills, and a lab report indicated a staphylococcus aureus infection at the catheter site on November 8, 1999. The catheter was replaced with a left Quinton catheter on November 12, 1999, and Streich complained of back pain to Dr. Dougherty on November 14, 1999. Upon discharge on November 16, 1999, Dr. Dougherty instructed Streich to continue outpatient dialysis.

Streich's back pain persisted, and CT scans revealed an atypical compression fracture. Dr. Dougherty informed him of a hairline crack on January 8, 2000, which he said would improve gradually. When Streich's condition worsened, Dr. Dougherty referred him to a pain center on February 5, 2000, and a neurologist on February 28, 2000, for further evaluation. An MRI on February 29, 2000, revealed an epidural mass, and on March 1, 2000, Dr. Dougherty referred Streich to neurosurgeon Dr. Brent Clyde, who identified a lytic lesion at the L4 vertebrae. Dr. Eric Six operated on March 2, 2000, discovering an infection that was later linked to the earlier catheter surgery.

On February 27, 2002, Streich sent a notice of healthcare liability claim to Dr. Dougherty and others related to care starting November 3, 1999, and filed suit on April 9, 2002. Dr. Dougherty moved for summary judgment on traditional and no evidence grounds, claiming the statute of limitations barred all claims or those occurring before February 27, 2000, and asserting no evidence of duty, breach of duty, or proximate causation. The trial court granted summary judgment without specifying the basis.","The court will focus primarily on whether a physician-patient relationship existed between the appellant and the appellee, and if the appellee owed the appellant a professional duty. The relationship was established, indicating a duty to provide skilled professional care. Expert testimony from Dr. Allen I. Arieff will confirm this and argue that Dr. Dougherty breached the standard of care by not providing sufficient post-surgical treatment, which could have remedied the infection resulting from the catheter surgery.

The court will delve into the intricacies of the statute of limitations, determining that the notice letter Streich sent to Dr. Dougherty does not set the accrual date for limitation purposes but tolls the limitation period once the cause of action has accrued. The notice letter extended the limitation period for 75 days. The court will examine whether Dr. Dougherty's alleged negligence was part of an ongoing course of treatment leading up to February 27, 2000, and beyond.

By evaluating the entire course of treatment from November 1999 through March 2000, the court will likely find that no specific treatment failures can be pinpointed to a particular date but instead, the failures occurred over the entire span of treatment. The court will argue that Dr. Dougherty repeatedly failed to recognize and treat the developing infection and that his negligence continued until the final diagnosis on March 2, 2000.

Consequently, the court will predict that the limitations had not expired when Streich sent his notice letter on February 27, 2002, since the negligent treatment was an ongoing process extending into March 2000, well within the two-year limitation period (plus the 75-day tolling period) when the suit was filed in April 2002.

Therefore, the court will conclude that Dr. Dougherty did not meet his burden to conclusively prove the statute of limitations barred the suit and that summary judgment was inappropriate on both traditional and no evidence grounds. The court will reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings, allowing the appellant's claims to be considered on their merits."
"The appellant insured brought an action against appellee insurers to recover damages to a dam structure following an incident involving lightning. The case unfolded in the 113th District Court of Harris County, Texas, with a jury. The dispute revolved around the interpretation of the fire insurance policies held by the appellant, which covered damage from specific events including lightning strikes. Twenty-five special issues were submitted to the jury, and their findings overall were in favor of the appellant. However, the trial court honed in on their response to Special Issue No. 3, which asked whether a tree had been ""exploded out of the ground"" during the incident. Despite other findings, the trial court focused on this issue and decided in favor of the insurers, denying the claim. This decision implied that the answer to Special Issue No. 3 was materially determining the entire controversy, despite the fact that the appellant's claim did not rest solely on the condition of an ""exploded tree"" but on the occurrence of damage caused by lightning, as per the insurance contract.

During the proceedings, the insurers' primary defense was that flood water, not lightning, was the sole cause of damage to the dam. The jury sided with the appellant, finding that lightning did strike a tree and that it was the proximate cause of the dam's damage. However, the trial court issued judgment in favor of the insurers based on its interpretation of Special Issue No. 3. Both parties acknowledged that the trial court based its judgment on the jury's verdict, without ruling out any issues initially submitted to the jury. The appellant's pleading was general and not restricted to the idea of an exploded tree, implying coverage for broader instances of lightning damage.}

{","The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment and render a decision in favor of the appellant. The reasoning will be that the trial court erred when it disregarded other jury findings that were favorable to the insured and relied solely on the answer to Special Issue No. 3. The appellate court will hold that the entry of judgment based on the jury's verdict is a ministerial act, and the trial court must adhere to the jury’s broader verdict unless it finds a complete lack of supporting evidence. Since the remaining twenty-four issues submitted to the jury supported the appellant's claim, and Special Issue No. 3 was not material to the cause of action as declared and contested by the opposing parties, the appellate court will determine it to have been immaterial and should have been disregarded by the trial court.

The appellate court will conclude that since the appellant's recovery rights were not predicated on damages solely from an exploded tree, the jury's verdict, which found damage was proximately caused by lightning (as per Special Issue No. 2), mandates a judgment in favor of the appellant. Following this, the appellate court will also find the trial court disregarded the rule that requires the following of the jury's verdict as per Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 300 and 301. The appellate court will thus reverse the original judgment and will enter a new judgment in favor of the appellant, with the insurers held liable for the proportionate extent of insurance coverage as issued by each, according to the amounts and proportions set forth in the appellant's motion for judgment. The appellate court's orders relating to the filing of a statement of facts will be rescinded, as deemed unnecessary under the findings.}"
"Plaintiff mother initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against defendant doctor following the death of her newborn child. The mother alleged that the defendant was negligent for not properly diagnosing and treating her preeclampsia, which she claimed led to the stillbirth. During the litigation, the mother passed away, and the case was continued by the temporary guardian of her estate and the next friend of her minor child. The defendant doctor appealed the jury’s verdict, which awarded the plaintiff damages, on the grounds of insufficient evidence regarding causation, breach of the standard of care, and mental anguish damages. The defendant also claimed errors in evidentiary rulings, jury instructions, questions, and alleged cumulative errors.

The case involved evidence related to the mother’s preeclampsia condition, the argument that the mother was denied an autopsy which could have provided conclusive evidence, testimonies on whether the standard of care was breached, and the mother's mental anguish. Additionally, there was legal debate over the proper assignees and successors to the lawsuit following the mother's death.","The appellate court will affirm the verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The court will find that there is sufficient evidence to establish the causation between the defendant’s negligence and the death of the fetus due to the preeclampsia condition. The court will conclude that the expert testimony demonstrated a causal connection based upon reasonable medical probability, and that the defendant's challenges to the evidence will be found to be insufficient, failing to either discredit the causation or firmly establish an alternative cause of death.

Regarding the breach of the standard of care, the court will conclude that the evidence sufficiently established that the defendant deviated from the normative standard treatment for preeclampsia at the time. The court will also support its affirmation by indicating that this breach led to the injury, being the death of the fetus, thus establishing two of the necessary elements for a medical malpractice claim.

On mental anguish, the court will find that the jury had ample testimony upon which to base their verdict and that the mental anguish damages were part of a reasonable compensation for the mother’s suffering. The plaintiff's mental anguish, as testified by witnesses, constituted a high degree of mental pain and distress related to the stillbirth, which qualified as part of the plaintiff’s body.

Regarding procedural and evidentiary challenges, such as arguments concerning jury instructions and admissibility of evidence, the court will determine that any errors made were not prejudicial enough to warrant a reversal. The court will find that the jury was instructed properly regarding the differentiation between compensable and non-compensable mental anguish and that the evidence presented at trial was relevant to the case.

Finally, the court will reject arguments related to cumulative error on the basis that they found no reversible individual errors. Therefore, the cumulative error doctrine will not apply, and the judgment by the lower court will be upheld."
