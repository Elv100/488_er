Background:
The appellant, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), manufactured silicone gel breast implants and distributed them to plastic surgeons from the late 1970s to the 1980s. 3M acquired McGhan, a company formed to produce medical implants, in 1977. The package inserts for the implants included warnings about capsular contracture, rupture, and leakage. Four plaintiffs, Danna Atterbury, Lynne Bliven Overbey, Sherry Bonds, and Patricia Stewart, used 3M's implants in breast augmentation procedures between 1979 and 1984, and subsequently experienced a variety of health issues they attributed to the implants. They had the implants removed between 1994 and 1995 and sued 3M for negligence and products liability.

A jury found that the breast implants had the marketing, manufacturing, and design defects when they left the manufacturer and that these defects caused the plaintiffs’ illnesses or injuries. The jury also found 3M both negligent and grossly negligent, with this negligence being the proximate cause of the plaintiffs’ issues. The jury verdict awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the plaintiffs. However, 3M filed motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing the plaintiffs lacked sufficient reliable scientific evidence that silicone breast implants caused their specific injuries and illnesses, and that they did not offer sufficient evidence for an award of punitive damages.

In this appeal case, concerning the sufficiency and reliability of scientific evidence required for causation in product liability cases, several critical aspects were analyzed. The considerations included whether 3M waived its right to appeal due to insufficient causation evidence by not objecting to the jury question on "illness versus injury," and a discussion about the reliability of expert witness testimony and the standard for admitting such testimony. The assessment of evidence reliability involved a detailed analysis of epidemiological studies and expert testimony presented by the plaintiffs’ experts - Dr. Robert Herndon, Dr. Jeffrey Gross, and Dr. Mitchell Forman, and examined their methodologies, qualifications, and the strength of their scientific conclusions regarding causation. The evaluation was guided by the legal precedents set in cases like Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, and Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, adopting factors to determine scientific reliability, such as peer review, potential rate of error, and general acceptance in the scientific community.

The appeals court determined that the appellants did not waive their claims regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support a causation finding, and went on to scrutinize the evidence presented by the plaintiffs' experts using the principles from Daubert, Robinson, and Havner. The court found the epidemiological studies cited by the plaintiffs non-conclusive and the expert testimonies not based on recognized scientific methods, thus not sufficiently reliable to establish generial causation. The court concluded that without reliable proof of general causation, no evidence could support the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.

Verdict:
The court would reason that in order to uphold a jury's determination of causation in a product liability case, reliable scientific evidence must be presented to demonstrate that an alleged harmful agent both can cause injury in the general population (general causation) and did cause injury to specific individuals (specific causation). Considering the facts of the case, the plaintiffs’ evidence was scrutinized for its scientific validity according to the standards established in cases such as Daubert and Havner. It would be noted that the expert testimony presented by the plaintiffs was insufficient to establish general causation because the methodologies used were not generally accepted in the scientific community and lacked peer-reviewed epidemiological support with appropriate levels of statistical significance.

Moreover, since the epidemiological studies cited were not found to be scientifically reliable or they did not demonstrate a sufficiently elevated risk of harm, they would not be deemed adequate to support the plaintiffs’ allegations. Additionally, the court would likely reject anecdotal case reports, differential diagnosis unsupported by reliable science, and personal experience of experts as singular bases for causal conclusions. The court would also consider other potential causes for the plaintiffs’ symptoms, which the experts' testimonies failed to rule out with reasonable certainty. Given that the requirements for proving both general and specific causation were not met, the court would rule that there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.

Taking all these into consideration, the court would reverse the judgment that had been entered in favor of the plaintiff implant patients, thus entering judgment in favor of the appellant manufacturer, 3M. The lack of reliable scientific evidence to prove general causation would be the central reason for reversing the jury's verdict and would underscore the importance of rigorous scientific methods and validation in establishing causation in product liability cases, especially where complex medical conditions and possible causal connections are involved.
