Background: Scott, a 46-year-old optometrist, suffered from ventricular tachycardia, or rapid heartbeat. His doctor prescribed Tambocor for this condition in 1998. On January 19, 2000, when his heartbeat did not return to normal after taking Tambocor, Scott was taken to Las Colinas Medical Center's emergency room. Nurse Crain, an emergency room nurse at the Medical Center, took Scott's initial information, and emergency room personnel confirmed via EKG that he was experiencing ventricular tachycardia.

Scott informed Nurse Crain that he had taken Tambocor for his rapid heartbeat, but it was not effective. He also expressed a desire to avoid cardioversion ("shocking"). Scott was conscious, stable, and in no pain. Dr. Kimberly Zeh ordered treatments for Scott, which did not stabilize his heartbeat. She consulted with Dr. John Osborne, the on-call cardiologist, and subsequently ordered administration of 5 milligrams of Verapamil, a drug contraindicated for ventricular tachycardia. Paramedic Johansen administered the Verapamil, causing Scott to suffer a severe drop in blood pressure, a convulsion, and cardiac arrest, leading to anoxic brain injury.

At trial, Nurse Crain testified, acknowledging awareness of the drug's contraindications and potential risks, which included death. Despite serious concerns about Verapamil's appropriateness, Nurse Crain did not intervene. Nurse Heskes, House Supervisor and top/head nurse that night, was also aware of Verapamil's contraindications and had serious questions yet failed to intervene.

The Medical Center had no job description for emergency room paramedics like Johansen; a policy titled "Procedures Performed by Non-Physicians" prohibited paramedics from administering cardiac medications.

The ACLS manual warns against administering Verapamil to patients with ventricular tachycardia, highlighting the potential for rapid deterioration. Despite Nurse Crain, Johansen, and Nurse Heskes acknowledging awareness of these warnings and having serious questions about the drug, they did not act on them. Dr. Zeh had ordered Verapamil following a conversation with Dr. Osborne and thought it was recommended.

Dr. Osborne testified he did not order Verapamil; he only mentioned some ventricular tachycardias in young people may be classified as Verapamil-sensitive. He returned to the hospital after learning Scott remained stable but found upon arrival that Scott had already been administered Verapamil resulting in his severe anoxic encephalopathy, a consequence of the drug's effects.

Expert witnesses testified on both sides, with varying opinions on the appropriateness of Verapamil for Scott's condition; however, the preponderance of evidence pointed to it being contraindicated. Scott's life expectancy and future medical expenses were also discussed, with projections made for ongoing care needs.

Verdict: The evidence for negligence and malice was legally and factually sufficient, showing the drug's administration involved an extreme risk of harm, and key medical staff were aware of the risk yet went ahead with administration. The jury could reasonably infer that the Verapamil administration proximately caused Scott's injury, as he was stable before its administration, and it was known to be contraindicated. The jury's decision to attribute malice to the Medical Center was supported by evidence that a vice principal of the hospital recognized the risk and ratified the conduct by failing to intervene.

The monetary damages awarded to Scott for future medical expenses were within the jury's discretion, given his injuries and care requirements, without the necessity for expert testimony to establish precise future costs. The updated pre and postjudgment interest rates asserted by the appellants were not applicable to this case because they are effective prospectively and not on judgments already signed or subject to appeal prior to the amendment date. As such, the offsets were not applicable, and the judgment was affirmed as proper based on the evidence presented.
