Background:
Richard Hollas Rogge was arrested for driving while intoxicated and placed in a holding cell at the City of Richmond police station. The cell included a metal grate covering an air vent, positioned directly above a toilet. Rogge was left alone for approximately three hours during which he committed suicide using his shirt to hang himself from the metal grate.

The plaintiffs, Rogge's parents, sued the City of Richmond and two police officers, presenting civil rights violations under federal law and causes of action under the Texas Tort Claims Act in both federal and state courts. The federal court entered a take-nothing judgment on federal claims and remanded the remaining state-law claims back to the district court.

In their state claims, the Rogges alleged negligence, wrongful-death, and survival claims tied to both the use and condition of the metal grate, stating it presented an unreasonable risk of harm as it was easily accessible to a person intending self-harm. They insisted that the metal grate, due to its size and lack of mesh backing, was a premises defect.

The City of Richmond motioned for summary judgment based on governmental immunity, contending the suicide was not caused by a condition or use of tangible property. It also invoked the discretionary-function exception to the limited waiver of immunity outlined in the Tort Claims Act.

The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment. The Rogges appealed, arguing that the city's use of tangible personal property and a condition of that property caused the death, and that the discretionary-function exception did not apply to their premises defect cause of action.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment favoring the City. It determined that the Rogges' claim was properly classified as a premises-defect claim rather than one based on the use of tangible personal property. The verdict will note that the plaintiffs' lawsuit depends on the duty of care that the City owed to people in the holding cell and not on any affirmative actions by the city's employees. 

The verdict will explain that for a condition of property to waive governmental immunity, it must make the property inherently dangerous during its intended use, and there must be a direct nexus between the property's condition and the injury. Since there was no evidence to suggest that the metal grating was inherently dangerous in its designed function as an air vent cover, or that the grate's condition actually caused Rogge's suicide, the statutory waiver of governmental immunity does not apply.

Additionally, the verdict will communicate that despite the Rogges having amended their petition in response to the jurisdictional challenge, they have not suggested any potential amendments that could cure the pleading defects. Given that the defect noted must pose a hazard in intended regular use, which was not established here, a remand for further amendments would be pointless.

Therefore, the verdict of the appellate court will be rooted in the lack of evidence supporting that the metal grating was a hazardous condition during ordinary use, and that the condition of the grate led to Rogge's death, thus afflicting the waiver of governmental immunity. Consequently, the court will lack subject-matter jurisdiction over the Rogges' claims.
