Background:
The appellant, an employee, suffered personal injuries from an oil well perforating gun explosion while rigging at a well site. The appellant was employed by McCullough Tool Company, and the owner of the drilling rig was Oil Production Maintenance Co., Inc. (O.P.M.). The appellant filed a products liability lawsuit against the appellee rigging company, Rig-A-Lite, Inc., which specialized in manufacturing electrical systems, including junction boxes for oil rigs. A jury found in favor of the appellant, identifying the negligent failure of the appellee to insulate a junction box as the sole proximate cause of the explosion, resulting in a verdict for over $500,000 in damages.

However, the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the appellee, challenging the jury's findings. The appellant sought a review asserting that the evidence supported the jury's decision, while the appellee contended that the jury's answers were contrary to the evidence's weight and preponderance, rendering them manifestly unjust. Evidence showed that the appellee contributed to the rig's electrical system, neglecting to insulate a junction box properly, this led to the box accumulating moisture and defectively insulated wiring, which charged metal rig components with electric potential.

Further thorough testimony revealed that repair and replacement of junction boxes were typical, and expert witnesses linked the poor insulation to the electrocution and the triggering of the perforating gun. The trial court ordered a reversal and remand, instructing that juror misconduct be reviewed before entry of the judgment for the appellant as per the jury's verdict.

Verdict:
Upon reviewing the procedural posture and the detailed evidence presented in the case, it's apparent that the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred by rendering judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The appellate court will point out that the jury's decision was backed by sufficient evidence, illustrating that the appellee indeed failed to ensure proper insulation of the junction box, which is a product manufactured and sold by appellee to be used in rigging operations conducive to high risks of injury if not carefully made. The defect in the junction box was linked directly to the injuries suffered by the appellant.

The court will assess the foreseeability of harm as a critical element in establishing a connection between the product's defect and the resultant damages, abiding by standards such as those set forth by the Restatement, Torts, ยง 395. The reasonably foreseeable risk of bodily harm exacerbates the manufacturer's liability due to negligent craftsmanship given the dangerous environment where the product is employed.

The evidence presented and confirmed by multiple witnesses will suggest that the improperly insulated junction box delivered by the appellee was likely the same box involved in the accident, given indicators such as the condition of the insulation tape and the purchasing history of new boxes within the time frame leading up to the incident.

Taking into consideration the appellant's significant injuries, his personal and financial hardships, the future impact on his life, and given that no other act of negligence has been identified, the court will find the amount of damages determined by the jury appropriate to the severity of the case. The court will observe that the verdict was reached through careful deliberation of the evidence without extrinsic influences.

The appellate court will direct the lower court to enter judgment in favor of the appellant in alignment with the jury verdict, also considering the due process for evaluating appellee's claims of juror misconduct, which must be substantiated through proper court procedures under Rule 324, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The reversal of the judgment, notwithstanding the verdict, indicates that the appellate court predicts the lower court should uphold the jury's decision and grant the appellant the awarded damages based on the veritable link between appellee's negligence and the appellant's injuries.
