Background:
The City of Tahoka (plaintiff) filed a property damage lawsuit against Keystone-Fleming Transport, Incorporated (defendant), following an incident involving two of the company's trucks. The trucks, carrying tanks of liquid gas, collided in Lynn County, eventually leading to a fire and subsequent explosion that damaged one of the city's fire trucks. Seeking the transfer of the lawsuit, the transportation company filed a plea of privilege to move the case to Lubbock County, where it claimed residence and principal place of business. The city filed a controverting affidavit to oppose this, citing venue statutes that would allow the case to remain in Lynn County.

During the incident that led to the lawsuit, a collision between the defendant's trucks caused a fire early in the morning of April 26, 1953. This event led to the deaths of both drivers and damage to the city's fire truck, which arrived to help extinguish the fire. No eyewitnesses to the events leading up to the fire survived to provide testimony. The only direct evidence came from J. W. Clinton, fire chief of the City of Tahoka, who arrived on the scene before the fire truck and from J. C. Fleming, secretary-treasurer of Keystone-Fleming Transport. Fleming's testimony included speculation about the events leading to the accident and aspects based on hearsay regarding the cause of the subsequent explosion.

The trial court overruled the transportation company's plea of privilege, which prompted an appeal. There was a question of whether there was any evidence that the company had agents or a principal office in Lynn County, as well as whether the company's drivers committed an active trespass or crime in Lynn County, which would affect the legal jurisdiction for the case. The city was attempting to prove negligence on the part of the company's drivers under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur—meaning "the thing speaks for itself"—which relies on the inference that the accident would not have happened had proper care been taken, due to the exclusive control of the instrumentality which caused the accident. However, the city could not establish specific acts of negligence and this reliance on inferred negligence lacked direct evidence.

Verdict:
Predicting a future verdict, the appellate court will likely reverse the trial court’s decision and render judgment in favor of transferring the case to Lubbock County. This is because the plaintiff has not satisfactorily proven that the defendant maintained a principal office or had an agent in Lynn County. Under Subdivision 23 of the venue statute, this would be necessary to establish appropriate venue in Lynn County. Furthermore, the plaintiff has not successfully demonstrated an active trespass or crime by the defendant’s drivers in Lynn County as required under the former Subdivision 9 of the venue statute for the case to be heard there.

In addition, the plaintiff's reliance on res ipsa loquitur will not hold as the evidence provided does not sufficiently lead to the belief that negligence occurred, nor does it show that the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the harm at the time of the accident. The lack of direct evidence means the plaintiff is relying on hearsay and speculative theories, which do not meet the necessary legal standards of proof for negligence or active trespass. To exemplify, the simultaneous occurrence of a fire and subsequent explosion as distinct accidental events cannot lead to the presumption of negligence without concrete evidence.

Given these circumstances, it is likely the court will hold that the plaintiff failed to refute the defendant’s plea of privilege by not establishing that the incident occurred as a result of the defendant’s negligence or a crime committed within the proper venue. Therefore, the appellate court's expected judgment will render the defendant's plea of privilege to be sustained, leading to the transfer of the lawsuit to the District Court of Lubbock County.
