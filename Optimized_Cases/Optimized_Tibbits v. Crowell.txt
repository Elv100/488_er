Background:
Appellants, Donald Lee Tibbits and wife, Josephine P. Tibbits, brought a suit as the sole heirs of their deceased ten-year-old son, William Douglas, seeking damages from appellees, D. H. Crowell and wife, Rosa Crowell, doing business as Dixie Dude Ranch. The lawsuit pertained to a tragic event where a fire in the main ranch house led to the death of William Douglas and Cody Connally, who was the ten-year-old grandson of the appellees. The fire's cause was unknown and it began near the northeast part of the house, which subsequently burned down entirely, with the two boys being unable to escape. At the time of the fire, Cody and his parents were visiting the appellees, and William was a social guest at the appellees' home.

On the night of October 31, 1964, William arranged to spend the night with Cody; both boys were to sleep in a second-floor room, and Mrs. Connally put them to bed around 10:00 p.m. before leaving with Mr. Connally to visit friends in nearby Bandera. The appellants alleged negligence on the part of the appellees based on three specific claims: 1) failure to keep close to William to prevent harm, 2) failure to provide an adequate fire escape, and 3) failure to direct William to sleep in a room where appellees knew he could be rescued in case of a fire.

Upon the discovery of the fire by appellees, the house was significantly engulfed in flames, hindering any possible rescue efforts to reach either of the rooms (8 or 10) where the boys were likely sleeping. Evidence suggested that even if a factual issue regarding the adequacy of the fire escapes was present, it ultimately held no causative effect on William's death as there was no indication he was able to use a fire escape.

Verdict:
The verdict will affirm the judgment of the trial court, supporting the instructed verdict for the appellees. The reasoning behind this affirmation rests on the legal principle that there must be a direct nexus between the alleged negligent act and the resulting injury—that is, the injury must be a natural and probable cause of the negligence in question. Even assuming the supposed negligence concerning the fire escapes was factually substantiated, it will be deemed irrelevant since no evidence suggests that William was in a position to utilize the escape routes present. Furthermore, the appellees' lack of knowledge regarding which room William was sleeping in will not be considered proximately causal, given the fire's intensity prevented any access to the rooms at the time appellees were alerted to the danger. Lastly, the argument of negligence based on sleeping arrangements falls short—the appellants did not present evidence demonstrating that the appellees could have reasonably anticipated any risk to William due to the sleeping conditions. Given these points, the court will conclude that no factual issues of negligence contributing to William's death were raised, and as such, the trial court's direction to the jury for a take-nothing verdict was appropriate.
