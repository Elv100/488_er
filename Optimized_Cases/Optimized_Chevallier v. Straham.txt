Background:
In Nacogdoches County, Texas, a group of cotton sellers (the appellants) took legal action against a set of carriers (the appellees) for damages due to the loss of cotton that was being hauled by the carriers. The carriers transported goods part-time while focusing primarily on farming. During one particular instance, while hauling cotton for the sellers, the bales caught fire and were completely destroyed. In the initial trials, no verdict was achieved in the first, and in the subsequent two, the jury found in favor of the defendants (carriers).

The carriers contended they were not common carriers but rather bailees or carriers for hire in only this particular instance, thus assuming they should not be liable under the stringent responsibilities of common carriers. They also argued that even if they were considered common carriers, they should be exempt from liability as the destruction of cotton was caused by an act of God—a sudden wind that was not under their control and was therefore not their fault.

The appeal brought into question whether entities that transport goods for hire, occasionally and not as a principal occupation, should be considered common carriers subject to the full extent of liabilities that accompany that designation. Definitions cited from legal authorities defined common carriers as those who undertake to carry goods for hire for the public, irrespective of whether this is a continuous or occasional occupation. The case also discussed the concept of an act of God as a possible defense for carriers, questioning whether an ordinary wind that spread fire to the cotton could be considered such an act.

Verdict:
The court held that common carriers are defined by their service of transporting goods for hire for the public, regardless of whether it is their usual occupation or only an incidental one. Therefore, any individual who transports goods for hire periodically and intermittently is to be considered a common carrier and is to shoulder all the associated responsibilities.

The appeals court, in considering the verdict, will evaluate the explanations of common carriers by various legal authorities and deduce that the appellees fall under that category. The court will find that the fact the carriers only operated their wagon during the hauling season, and that transporting goods was an incidental occupation, does not prevent them from being classified as common carriers.

In terms of the 'act of God' defense, the appeals court will predict that placing the cotton in proximity to a fire, even without an existing wind, can be seen as an overt risk, and the carriers should have foreseen the potential for the wind to carry the fire to the cotton. The fact that the wind is deemed an ordinary event in nature that can reasonably be anticipated will lead to the conclusion that the carriers are not relieved of their responsibilities in this regard. The court will presume that because the carriers hold the status of common carriers and since no act of God can be established, they are liable for the loss.

Taking these considerations into account, the court is likely to reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of the carriers and would remand the case for a new trial, concluding that the carriers, as common carriers, are responsible for the loss of the cotton.
