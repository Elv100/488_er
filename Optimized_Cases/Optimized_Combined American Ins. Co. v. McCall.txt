Background:
Combined American Insurance Company (Appellant) issued two accident insurance policies to Rufus P. McCall, specifying that death benefits would be payable conditional to the policy provisions. The policies provided coverage for losses resulting "directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injuries received . . . while this policy is in force and which loss or injuries are in no way caused or contributed to by disease." Pauline McCall, the insured's wife named as the beneficiary (Appellee), filed claims under both policies after her husband was found dead in a shallow playa lake next to his submerged pickup truck, with the autopsy reporting "CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS WITH RECENT THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION AND OLD MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION" as the cause of death. The Appellant denied the claim, asserting that the death was not accidental as it was contributed to by disease rather than being the sole result of accidental bodily injuries. Consequently, a lawsuit was initiated.

The background of the case includes the details of Rufus P. McCall's movement on February 9 and 10, 1972, the condition of the pickup truck, the autopsy results by Dr. H. P. Clifton, Jr., and the subsequent inquest by Justice Stanley Doss, concluding that McCall died from a heart attack caused by a motor vehicle accident. Throughout the case, the Appellee's contention was that McCall's death resulted from injuries due to an accident—an assertion supposedly supported by circumstances reconstructed by the investigating highway patrolman and the opinions of Dr. Clifton.

Additional evidence presented by Appellee and Appellant traced McCall's medical history back to 1948, which included multiple instances of heart-related illnesses, from bronchopneumonia with acute paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, other medical findings in 1955, a 1969 diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease, treatments and subsequent re-examinations by Dr. Joe A. Arrington, and the July 1970 hospitalization for sinusitis, polycythemia, and A.S.H.D. Both Dr. Clifton and Dr. Arrington provided expert medical testimonies indicating that pre-existing disease contributed to McCall's heart attack and subsequent death.

After presenting the evidence, Appellant moved for an instructed verdict, asserting that McCall's pre-existing disease contributed to his death, but the motion was overruled, and the case went to jury trial. The jury found in favor of the Appellee, and thus, a judgment was rendered for her. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision by seeking a review of the judgment, arguing that the trial court should have instructed a verdict in its favor because the undisputed evidence established that a pre-existing, uninsured disease contributed to McCall's death.

Verdict:
The Appellant will assert that the trial court should have granted its motion for an instructed verdict based on the explicit contractual liability terms of the insurance policies that require death to result solely from insured accidental bodily injuries, independently of all other causes, and not contributed to by the disease. The court will be persuaded by the unanimous and uncontroverted expert opinions that established a reasonable medical probability linking pre-existing disease to McCall's death. The Appellant will argue that both medical experts agreed the pre-existing disease contributed to the fatal heart attack, thereby negating the requirement that death be caused solely by accidental injury as stipulated in the policies.

Additionally, the Appellant will likely contend that the evidence presented by the Appellee surrounding the reconstruction of events and her husband’s good health prior to the accident is speculative and insufficient to create a fact issue, as it is contradicted by documented medical history and expert medical opinions indicating the necessity of pre-existing disease for such an event (the type of clot leading to occlusion) to occur. Furthermore, Appellant will argue that a layman's opinion, such as the Justice of the Peace's findings in the inquest report and on the certificate of death, cannot override the conclusive medical expert testimony on matters of specialized medical knowledge, such as the cause of a heart attack.

Considering the totality of the evidence, and particularly the competent medical evidence based on a reasonable medical probability, the court will likely reverse the judgment of the trial court and render a verdict that Appellee take nothing. The reason being that there is no competent evidence indicating that McCall’s accidental bodily injuries were the sole cause of his death, as per the terms stipulated in the insurance policies and decided in similar legal precedents like Mutual Benefit Health & Accident Ass'n v. Hudman. Therefore, the court will conclude that the trial court erred in not granting the instructed verdict for the Appellant.
