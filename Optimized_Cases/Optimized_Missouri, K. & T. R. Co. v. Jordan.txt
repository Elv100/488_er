Background: 
The appellant, a railway company, contested the trial court's decision that awarded damages of $10,000 to the administrator of a deceased railway employee's estate under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.S. §§ 51-59). The railway employee sustained an injury from a workplace collision and later died of pneumonia several weeks afterward. The damages were apportioned among the surviving children of the deceased. On appeal, several procedural and substantive legal issues arose. Firstly, the appellant challenged the timeliness of the filing of the appeal bond and the transcript, both of which were ruled to be non-issues due to the clerk's established approval of the bond and the appellee's waiver of the timely filing of the transcript. Additionally, concerns were raised about the adequacy of the pleadings in describing one of the children as "afflicted," which was deemed insufficient for determining that child's pecuniary loss and dependency on the decedent's support.

The action was brought by the estate's administrator because the Federal Employers' Liability Act required such cases to be filed by a representative of the employee's estate. A jury awarded the sum apportioned as follows: $2,400 to Leonard Arnold, $2,000 to Lennie Arnold, $2,400 to Travis Arnold, $2,800 to Bobbie Arnold, and $400 for physical and mental suffering. However, the railway company appealed, questioning the legal foundation of Leonard Arnold's dependency and compensation that extended beyond his age of majority, as well as the assertion that the railway employee’s injury was the proximate cause of his death from pneumonia.

The central issues in the appeal were the proper filing and timing of appeal bond and transcript, the adequacy of the pleadings regarding dependency and pecuniary loss, particularly concerning an "afflicted" child, and whether the injury was indeed the proximate cause of death.

Verdict:
The verdict of the appeal court can be anticipated to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings. This decision would likely rest on the court's analysis of the pleadings and the instructions given to the jury at trial. The court finds that the term "afflicted" used in the pleadings to describe one of the children, Leonard Arnold, does not adequately demonstrate his individual pecuniary loss or level of dependency on the deceased father's support, as required under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Furthermore, the appellate court may hold that the evidence related to Leonard's capacity to work and thus support himself was insufficient under the law, as the pleadings failed to define the nature of his affliction and did not claim an inability to earn a living.

Concerning the evidential connection between the injury and the employee's death, the court can determine that the trial court erroneously assumed negligence in its instructions to the jury, which should have been a vigorously contested question of fact and not a presumption. The appeal court might also agree with the railway company that the trial court did not properly address the railway’s defense theory, that the deceased's contributory negligence and failure to seek medical attention were factors that aggravated the initial injury and were not the proximate cause of death.

As a result, the verdict may well highlight that because of these legal errors, particularly the insufficient pleadings and incorrect jury instructions regarding dependency, pecuniary loss, and the issue of negligence, the jury's verdict cannot stand. While the evidence on the issue of proximate cause might be found sufficient to support the jury's verdict, errors identified in the proceedings would compel the court to reverse and remand the case for a new trial, allowing for proper pleadings and jury instructions in line with the stipulations of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and case law interpretations.
