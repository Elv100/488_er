Background:
The case involves an action by Jeffrey Peace and Caroline Peace (the Peaces), who purchased real estate in the City of Westlake Hills, Texas (the City) from Amy Hovis for $635,000. Hovis had an oral agreement with the City to donate a fifteen-foot right-of-way for the expansion of a roadway on the property. The City agreed to partition Hovis's lot into two lots in exchange for the donation. The partition separated the lots to face opposite roads—101 McConnell Drive and 102 Westhaven Drive. This agreement was written in the August 20, 2011 city council meeting minutes, and approximately a month later, the City executed the partition.

The Peaces were not informed of the right-of-way agreement by Hovis, Independence Title Company (ITC), or the title company's agents, the McMahans, during the purchase. However, during the purchase-option period, the Peaces were made aware of the possibility of a roadway expansion through an email forwarded to them by Hovis's real estate agent. Despite this, they closed on the property without a formalized right-of-way agreement.

After the sale, the City sought to have the Peaces fulfill Hovis's oral promise; the Peaces declined. In 2013, the city voided the partition that divided the lots. The Peaces then sued ITC, the McMahans, and others for common law fraud, fraud by nondisclosure, conspiracy to commit fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). During the proceedings, the City initiated condemnation proceedings to acquire the needed land for the roadway, which occurred after the Peaces filed their suit.

ITC and the McMahans sought summary judgment on no-evidence and traditional grounds, contending that their failure to disclose the right-of-way did not cause the Peaces damages. The Peaces sought summary judgment on traditional grounds regarding the breach of fiduciary duty claim. The trial court granted ITC and the McMahans' summary judgment motions and denied the Peaces' partial summary judgment motion. The Peaces' inverse-condemnation claim against the City was tried to a jury, who awarded the Peaces $297,000. The final judgment incorporated the summary judgment orders and awarded the Peaces the inverse-condemnation damages according to the jury's verdict.

Verdict:
The verdict upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees (ITC and the McMahans). It was determined that the Peaces failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove any amount as damages. The Peaces did not present a quantifiable measure of damages, such as the value expended versus the value received, the difference between the value as represented and the value received, or whether such damages were foreseeable and directly traceable to the wrongful acts by ITC and the McMahans.

The court also noted that while the Peaces claimed they would not have purchased the property had they known of Hovis's oral promise, the cause of any damages to the Peaces was the subsequent governmental condemnation of part of their property for roadway expansion, not actions taken or omitted by ITC or the McMahans. Furthermore, the City always had eminent domain power relevant to the case, meaning that even without the defendants’ supposed wrongful acts, the taking of the land by the City would have been imminent, indicating no causation from the defendants’ actions.

Additionally, since the Peaces were compensated for the right of way by the City in the condemnation proceedings, this demonstrated that the alleged wrongful non-disclosure by ITC and the McMahans did not cause losses that were uncompensated.

Therefore, the Peaces' argument regarding breach of fiduciary duty was also unpersuasive, as it relied partly on the causation element which was already overruled. As the damages and causation elements are common to all six claims made by the Peaces and the court found no sufficient evidence of damages or causation due to the aforementioned reasons, the verdict was that the Peaces take nothing from ITC and the McMahans.
