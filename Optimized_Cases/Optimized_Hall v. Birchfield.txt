  Background: The appellants in this case, which include a hospital and associated medical personnel, are appealing a judgment of $3,311,500.00 that was based on a jury verdict. The proceedings revolved around a medical malpractice case concerning retrolental fibroplasia (RLF), a condition that led to the blindness of Kellie Birchfield, the appellees' child. Kellie was born prematurely at Wadley Hospital in Texarkana and weighed only two pounds seven ounces. Due to her preterm birth, she required special medical attention in the hospital nursery, including the administration of high levels of oxygenâ€”a factor scientifically linked to the development of RLF in premature infants. The appellees, Kellie's parents, claimed damages for the blindness caused by alleged medical malpractice.

The hospital and physicians raised various points of error in their appeal, including concerns over jury instructions, qualification of attorneys, and the admittance of hearsay evidence. They also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict, and the inclusion of all damages and judgment interest. The appellees counter-claimed that not all damages awarded were included in the judgment. Furthermore, the court's opinion detailed numerous testimonies and specifics of the case such as the hospital's knowledge of the risks associated with high oxygen levels, the lack of necessary equipment and training for medical staff, and the failure to adequately monitor and adjust Kellie's oxygen levels or consider transferring her to a more equipped facility. Additionally, the child's blindness was known to Dr. Hall before discharge, but this information was not communicated to the parents until later.

  Verdict: The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, modifying it to include interest on the award, but deleted $1,000 awarded to each of Phillip J. Birchfield and Mary Jo Birchfield for shock and emotional trauma. This was predicated on the fact that such damages are effectively encompassed within the term "mental anguish," which had already been assessed by the jury. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in regards to its evidentiary rulings, refusal to disqualify attorneys as requested, nor its judgment concerning exhibited physical evidence and testimony related to negligence, proximate cause, and gross negligence. 

There was sufficient legal and factual evidence presented at the trial to substantiate claims of negligence in the care Kellie Birchfield received, which included the hospital's acknowledged inadequacies and refusal to upgrade nursery facilities, despite available funds and external warnings. It was determined that the hospital's negligence resulted in the administering of excessive supplemental oxygen without appropriate monitoring of blood gases, leading to Kellie's blindness, and a failure to obtain informed consent from the Birchfields regarding the risks. The court also held that there was objective and subjective evidence of gross negligence by the hospital, justifying the award for mental anguish to Kellie's parents, who were initially unaware of her condition upon discharge from the hospital.

Moreover, the court validated damages for the impaired parent-child relationship, as such damages recognize the lost experiences typically shared between parents and children. On the issue of damages for past physical pain and mental anguish, the court ruled that these should include prejudgment interest, compounded daily, from six months after Kellie's birth until the date of judgment. As for the hospital's contention about the duplicated award categories in the judgment, the court agreed and modified the judgment, ensuring that interest would begin from the date of the judgment, with specific exceptions noted.

However, the court found that the Birchfields were not entitled to both treble damages under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act and exemplary damages, as these remedies would amount to a double recovery for punitive damages stemming from the same conduct. Because the Birchfields failed to elect which remedy they sought, the court allowed only one measure of damages to stand. The calculation of prejudgment interest was further detailed, using a 10.79 percent rate compounded daily for the specific period leading up to the judgment, thereby adding to the affirmed recovery amount.

Lastly, the court took care to address whether certain instructions and issues presented to the jury might have constituted a comment on the weight of the evidence or mislead the jury. It concluded that although the wording of the gross negligence issue was not recommended, the jury was unlikely to have misinterpreted it.
