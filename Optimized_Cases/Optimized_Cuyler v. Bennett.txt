Background:
Appellant motorist, Cuyler, was injured in an automobile accident with appellee employee driver, Bennett, who was employed by Lone Star Veterinary Supply Company, Inc., and acquired by McKesson Corporation. On August 19, 1985, as Cuyler braked suddenly for the driver in front of her, Bennett attempted to avoid collision but still bumped Cuyler's vehicle, causing minor visible damage. Both parties subsequently focused on the question of damages. Cuyler contended her injuries were caused by the accident, evidenced by subsequent medical issues and a loss of income. However, Bennett and Lone Star argued her injuries were due to pre-existing conditions and other accidents. In the trial court, the jury found Bennett negligent but did not award Cuyler future damages. They awarded damages for past physical pain and mental anguish, and for past medical care, but none for loss of earning capacity, ongoing physical impairment, or future medical care.

The trial court's judgment was such that Cuyler was to recover $5,000 plus prejudgment interest and costs from Bennett, taking nothing from Lone Star or McKesson. Cuyler's objections were overruled, including those regarding Lone Star's liability, the capacity of Bennett as an employee at the time of the accident, and irregularities in the jury's findings. She also argued that the trial court failed to include instructions and definitions needed for the jury and that the damages awarded did not reflect the undisputed facts of the case.

Verdict:
The trial court's judgment awarding damages to appellant, Cuyler, for her personal injury claim against appellee employee driver, Bennett, will be affirmed, along with the take-nothing judgment against appellee employer, Lone Star. The denial of the capacity of principal for employee driver Bennett by appellee employer, Lone Star, did not require a verified pleading, aligning with established rules that agency relationships do not need denial in verified pleadings.

The court will find that the jury's verdict on damages was not against the weight of the evidence due to the presented evidence of appellant Cuyler's pre-existing medical condition and involvement in other accidents. It will be determined that the jury's answers regarding whether Bennett was acting as an employee of Lone Star and McKesson at the time of the accident and whether he was in the scope of his employment are not inconsistent, as the scope of employment completely encompasses the inquiry into Bennett’s employee status.

Regarding damages, the argument that Cuyler’s pre-existing medical conditions did not lessen the liability of the defendant will be considered in the context of the jury being instructed properly to award Cuyler all damages proximately caused by Bennett’s negligence. The judgment against Bennett will not differ regardless of the agency status of employment since the damages are compensatory for the actual injury suffered by Cuyler. Moreover, Lone Star’s failure to file a verified pleading, specifically denying liability, will be seen as not a reversible error due to it concerning mistaken legal capacity and not an agency relationship.

The court will order a reformation of the judgment to award prejudgment interest reflecting the correct period for computing prejudgment interest from six months after the occurrence of the incident, beginning December 18, 1987, to the date of the judgment, June 30, 1991, at a rate of 10 percent per year, according to the applicable rules and statutes governing the awarding of prejudgment interest. 

Any further contentions by Cuyler, such as errors in jury instructions regarding pre-existing medical conditions, the definition of mental anguish, or presumptions arising from nonproduction of evidence, will be overruled based on reasonings that the court's charge adequately confined the jury's considerations to damages directly resulting from the defendant's negligence, and that the term "mental anguish" does not necessitate definition as a legal term. Furthermore, any claims concerning prejudice due to nonproduction of documents will not succeed as they did not likely cause an improper judgment given the jury's findings. 

In conclusion, since the evidence supported the jury's findings, demonstrated no conflicting answers on material facts, and justified the damages awarded, the trial court’s judgment will be affirmed with the noted interest adjustments.
