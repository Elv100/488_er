Background:
Infant Olivia Marie Coats (Olivia) died shortly after her birth. Her parents, Rachel Ann Melancon and Trent Allen Coats, filed wrongful death claims against Dr. George Backardjiev, Melancon's obstetrician, and the Medical Center, where Olivia was born. The allegations included negligence and gross negligence in the administration of Pitocin and use of forceps during delivery, which they claimed resulted in Olivia's hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and subsequent death.

During labor and delivery, Pitocin, a medication to stimulate labor, was administered. At one point, nurses questioned the continued use of Pitocin and use of forceps, exhibiting behavior indicating a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Despite these concerns and the appearance of severe fetal heart rate decelerations, Pitocin was continued, and forceps delivery was attempted. Following unsuccessful forceps attempts, a C-section was decided upon. Dr. Backardjiev used substantial force during the attempted forceps delivery, resulting in multiple skull fractures to Olivia.

Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Akin, offered testimony on the standard of care and causation. Dr. Akin testified that the increased use of Pitocin was inappropriate given the concerning evidence on the fetal monitoring strip and that the HIE was caused by the inadequate oxygenation of Olivia in utero. He also believed that the use of forceps contributed to severe skull fractures and HIE, but did not itself cause the HIE.

The jury found that the negligence of Dr. Backardjiev and the Medical Center proximately caused Olivia's death, assigning 95% responsibility to Dr. Backardjiev and 5% to the Medical Center. Damages of over $10 million were awarded.

The Medical Center moved for a Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) arguing no competent evidence existed tying the acts or omissions of Medical Center employees to Olivia’s death, and that Dr. Akin was not qualified to express causation opinions on neurologic damage. The trial court denied the JNOV, and the Medical Center appealed.

Verdict:
The background demonstrates that Dr. Akin, based on his extensive experience and training as an obstetrician and gynecologist (ob-gyn), was qualified to opine on the causal relationship between labor, delivery, and resulting complications, including neurological injuries. His testimony did not rely solely on the fetal monitoring strip but incorporated the fetal blood gases at delivery and the clinical manifestations of HIE post-delivery, thus providing a reliable basis for his opinions.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that Dr. Akin's testimony was reliable. His opinions were not based solely on subjective interpretation but were supported by his expertise in obstetrics and gynecology, his understanding of fetal monitoring, and the administration of Pitocin. Furthermore, he was familiar with the expected course of managing labor and delivery, including the use of forceps. Therefore, his testimony about the cause of the infant's HIE was grounded in recognized scientific principles and his considerable professional experience.

The jury's verdict held both Dr. Backardjiev and the Medical Center responsible for Olivia's death. Given the evidence presented, specifically Dr. Akin's testimony, the jury could reasonably conclude that the continued administration of Pitocin, against indications of fetal distress, and the attempted forceps delivery were significant factors contributing to Olivia's HIE and death. Additionally, the jury could find that the Medical Center, through its employees, breached the standard of care by not adequately responding to the signs of fetal distress and negligently administering Pitocin, which contributed to Olivia's HIE.

Given that the appeal did not show an error in the trial court's findings regarding expert qualifications or testimony reliability, the appellate court will affirm the trial court’s determination on the verdict. The Medical Center's arguments for JNOV lack merit because the expert testimony provided by Dr. Akin was found to be both reliable and based on a reasonable medical probability sufficient to establish causation. The trial court did not err in denying the Medical Center’s motion for JNOV and the appellate court will hold that the judgment against the Medical Center should be affirmed.
