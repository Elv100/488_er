Background:
In 2008, Gerald B. Hindy, president and CEO of AG Financial Solutions, met with Lance Duncan about investing in the oil and gas industry. AG Financial Solutions created Steward Energy to purchase oil and gas properties identified by Duncan, namely the Batson and Wortham leases, for a total of $10.5 million. Despite the purchase, the leases operated at a loss, leading to a dispute settlement in 2009 where Mark III agreed to pay Steward Energy $1,080,000.

In 2010, AG Financial Solutions and Steward Energy sued Duncan for various claims related to these transactions. The parties ultimately settled, with Duncan's entities agreeing to certain terms, including executing a promissory note for $9,500,000 secured by a deed of trust and the defendants signing a Confession of Judgment for $6,000,000, which was to be offset by payments made according to the promissory note terms.

A second settlement in 2013 acknowledged the outstanding judgment and set conditions for its reduction based on the outstanding sums owed to Steward Energy. A Consolidated Loan Agreement was also executed to combine outstanding debts. The Deed of Trust provided security for this agreement. In 2014, Ride the Wave, LLC sued Duncan and his entities, leading to the termination of a purchase and sale agreement (PSA) with Ryder Operating, LLC.

Steward Energy foreclosed Duncan's assets, including the Bateson and Wortham leases and Duncan's lake house, due to defaults under the loan agreement. In 2016, Duncan's entities filed suit against Appellees (including Steward Energy, AG Financial Solutions, and Hindy), claiming tortious interference, wrongful foreclosure, among other things, and seeking declaratory judgment.

Appellees asserted affirmative defenses such as release and res judicata. During the case, litigation in Freestone County also transpired, where a turnover proceeding resulted in a judgment against Duncan's entities, which they unsuccessfully attempted to overturn. The trial court ruled in favor of Appellees.

Verdict:
Given the history and circumstances of the case, the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of Appellees concerning Appellants' claims for tortious interference with the PSA, wrongful foreclosure, and declaratory relief was rooted in well-established legal principles including res judicata and the interpretation of contract and deed terms. Res judicata was applicable because Appellants' claim for declaratory relief could have been raised during the turnover proceeding. Concerning the wrongful foreclosure claim, the non-material alterations to the deed of trust did not render it void, and thus the foreclosure was not wrongful as the original deed of trust allowed for foreclosure given a default.

For the tortious interference claim, Appellees provided conclusive evidence that the PSA contained provisions allowing Ryder Operating to terminate the agreement validly, without breaching it. Ryder Operating exercised its contractual rights due to misrepresentations and breach of warranties by Mark III, rather than as a result of Appellees’ inducement. In summary, the trial court's decision was predicated on the doctrine of res judicata, the validity of foreclosure proceedings, and the interpretation of contractual rights within the PSA, which established that Appellees neither willfully interfered with the PSA nor wrongfully foreclosed on Appellants' assets. The Appellees’ actions were within their rights based on the established terms of the contracts and judicial findings, supporting the trial court's denial of Appellants' claims.
