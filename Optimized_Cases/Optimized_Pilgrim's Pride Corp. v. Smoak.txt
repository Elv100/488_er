Background:
William A. Smoak was injured in a collision with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer rig operated by Pilgrim's Pride Corporation employee Paul Dixon Link. The accident occurred when Smoak, driving westbound on Watson Boulevard, was making a right turn onto Broadnax Street, Daingerfield, via a merge lane from Watson onto Broadnax. At that moment, Link, driving eastbound on Watson, executed a left turn onto Broadnax and moved directly into Smoak's merge lane, causing a collision. The collision resulted in a back injury to Smoak that required surgery.

Smoak sued Pilgrim's Pride and Link, alleging negligence. At trial, a jury found that Pilgrim's Pride and Link were seventy-five percent at fault, while Smoak was twenty-five percent at fault. Smoak was awarded various damages, including $50,000 for past physical pain and mental anguish; $25,000 for future pain and anguish; $37,500 for past loss of earning capacity; $200,000 for future loss of earning capacity; $100,000 for past physical impairment; $100,000 for future physical impairment; $91,103.93 for past medical care; and $25,000 for future medical care. Additionally, $3,989.28 was awarded in stipulated property damage. The court applied prejudgment interest, resulting in a total award of $632,761.49.

Pilgrim's Pride appealed, contesting several points, including the admissibility and evidentiary value of the testimony from the investigating officer regarding negligence determination and the testimony of Smoak's economic expert concerning the loss of future earning capacity. Pilgrim's Pride contested that there was no or insufficient evidence on causation, lost earnings, and a need for future medical care to sustain the judgment.

Verdict:
The appellate court will find that the policeman who investigated the accident, Ronald Penny, was neither qualified nor lacking proper credentials as an accident reconstruction expert to give an expert opinion on the negligence that caused the accident. However, his general observations made at the scene will be deemed admissible, as they are rational and helpful for understanding his testimony and determining the cause of the accident. The court will view Penny's deterministic opinion on who caused the accident as not meeting the requirement for admissible expert testimony but will nonetheless consider his observations and heeding the testimony of other witnesses about the collision.

The court will uphold Smoak's economic expert, Dale Funderburk's, testimony and calculations regarding Smoak's post-accident wage earning capacity, accepting that Funderburk applied consistent methodology to determine Smoak's future loss of earning capacity and that the expert's alterations to post-accident wages did not materially change his methodology or results.

The court will also reverse the part of the judgment that awarded Smoak future medical expenses, concluding that no evidence was presented showing a reasonable probability that Smoak would need future medical treatment, as the evidence only indicated mere possibility or speculation without a showing of likely medical expenses above a fifty percent chance.

In all other aspects, the judgment from the trial court will be affirmed. Smoak's provided evidence, including the testimony regarding the diminished capacity to work even after surgery and the fiscal impacts experienced, is sufficient to affirm the jury's findings of past and future loss of earning capacity. The role of the jurors' discretion becomes crucial in the context of uncertainty surrounding earning capacity from the injury sustained and subsequent medical treatment. Thus, the court will determine that the criteria for legal and factual sufficiency have been met for the affirmed parts of the judgment, given the peculiarity of the facts and the evidence at trial.
