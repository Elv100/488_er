Background:
The appellant, an insurance company, contested a ruling in favor of the appellee, the insured homeowner, regarding a claim for a damaged refrigerator under a Texas Standard Homeowner's insurance policy, which covered "loss by lightning" but excluded loss caused by rot, among other things. The appellee's refrigerator stopped functioning while he was away from home for 12 days, and as a result, the food inside rotted, resulting in damage to the refrigerator. When the appellee returned home, he discovered that the breaker switches for all 10 separate electrical circuits in his residence were in the "off" position, indicating an external surge of electricity had caused them to trip.

An electrical engineer (the plaintiff) stated that an exterior surge of electricity was needed to trip all the circuit breakers, suggesting that lightning could be the only cause. In addition, there was corroborating testimony from a power company employee, who stated that during the appellee's absence there were several severe electrical storms in the area and that the power company's equipment showed signs of lightning strikes and power interruptions due to severe weather. Other evidence included similar damage to electrical systems in the neighborhood due to the storms, as well as testimony from the appellee's son about concurrent damage during the storm.

The insurer argued that because the refrigerator was damaged by rotting food, which was an excluded peril, the lightning could not be considered the proximate cause of the loss. They contended that the loss was due to deterioration, which was not covered by the policy. Their stance was essentially that the lightning was a remote cause of the damage and thus did not trigger coverage under the policy.

Verdict:
The verdict favored the appellee, upholding the judgment that granted him coverage for the loss of the refrigerator due to lightning under the Texas Standard Homeowner's insurance policy. The court's rationale was based on the evidence of probative force suggesting that lightning was indeed the dominant, efficient, and moving cause of the refrigerator's loss. According to the evidence presented, the lightning set off subsequent incidental, resulting, and consequential processes (like the food rotting), which in a natural and continuous sequence led to the refrigerator's damage. The court will find that the rotting food was not an independent intervening cause of the damage but merely an intermediate step in the chain of causation initiated by the lightning strike.

The court, in predicting this verdict, will likely rely on precedents that establish liability for all known effects of lightning as a direct and natural consequence of the lightning itself, regardless of other incidental agencies contributing to the loss or damage. Since the evidence demonstrates that the lightning indirectly caused all 10 circuit breakers to trip, which in turn caused the refrigerator to shut down and the food to rot, the damage to the refrigerator is a direct and natural consequence of the lightning, and thus the insurer is liable for the loss. The court will also conclude that while the lightning did not strike any part of the house or the refrigerator directly, it was still the proximate cause of the loss and not merely a remote cause. Therefore, the policy did insure against the loss, and the appellee is entitled to coverage for the damage to the refrigerator.
