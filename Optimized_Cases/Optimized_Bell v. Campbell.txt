Background:
This case revolves around a multi-vehicle accident that happened on U.S. Highway 67 near Texarkana. Mrs. Addie Campbell, driving her pickup truck, attempted to cross the highway into the westbound lane when her pickup truck was struck in the rear by an automobile driven by Thomas J. Marshall. The collision occurred at night under rainy conditions. As a result of the impact, Marshall's trailer became disengaged and overturned in the north traffic lane. Mrs. Campbell's vehicle was knocked off the roadway, as was Marshall's, but the trailer posed a danger on the highway.

William Payton Jr., John Homer Bell, and Frank T. Bransford stopped to help remove the trailer from the road. During their attempt, they were struck by a third vehicle driven by W. W. Fore, resulting in the death of Payton and Bell and injuries to Bransford. Fore had either ignored or did not see the signals given by another person to alert oncoming traffic of the hazard. Fore, who was later discovered to be driving and had been drinking, initially falsely claimed his wife was driving.

The petitioners, the statutory beneficiaries of Payton and Bell, and the injured Bransford, filed suit against the two initial motorists (Marshall and Mrs. Campbell) and Mr. and Mrs. Fore. After settling with the Fores, they proceeded against Marshall and Mrs. Campbell, who also filed for indemnity and contribution from the Fores.

The court's task was to assess causation. Respondents (Marshall and Mrs. Campbell) were acquitted by the jury of any negligence that could be a proximate cause of the second collision, with the findings attributing proximate causation to the negligence of Mr. Fore. The court faced the question of whether respondents' potential negligence could have foreseen the resulting injuries from the secondary accident, an issue of proximate cause and the foreseeability of an independent intervening cause.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment in favor of the respondent motorists from the trial and appellate court, holding that their conduct, even if negligent, was not the proximate cause of the injuries sustained in the second accident. The reasoning will hinge upon the legal principle that for an act to be the proximate cause of an injury, it must have been foreseeable that the act could lead to the injury, implying that the injury should be a natural and probable result of the act. Since the actions of Marshall and Mrs. Campbell were deemed complete, having ceased exerting influence, their inadvertent creation of the initial condition did not actively contribute to the injuries sustained from the second collision. Instead, Fore's intervention was independent, new, and unforeseeable, breaking the chain of causation from the first accident.

The court will elaborate that the negligence of the respondents did not concur with Fore's actions to cause the injuries, as it was too remote and not the immediate cause. Respondents could not have reasonably anticipated that their actions could lead to the serious injury or deaths of individuals unrelated to the original incident. Fore's actions will be viewed as the new, independent, and intervening cause that served as the active and immediate cause of the injuries.

The jury's earlier findings will be pivotal in supporting the court's decision. The jury's refusal to find Marshall negligent in various respects, its attribution of proximate cause for the first collision to Mrs. Campbell's negligence, and clear findings that Fore's conduct in the second collision constituted a new and independent cause, will guide the court's analysis. As such, respondents will be relieved from liability for the injuries sustained by Payton, Bell, and Bransford in the secondary collision based on the principles of proximate cause and foreseeability within Texas law.
