Background:
General Chemical Corporation manufactures a chemical product called sodium metabisulfite, used by shrimpers to preserve the color of shrimp after it is caught and referred to in the industry as "shrimp dip." The decedents, brothers Gustavo and Jose De La Lastra, worked as commercial fishermen using this product regularly. In July 1988, the brothers died from asphyxiation by sulfur dioxide gas while using the product on their fishing vessel, the "Wilderness," near Brownsville, Texas. The sufficiency of the productâ€™s warning labels was brought into question. Expert testimony at the trial indicated that while the label on the product mentioned it could be toxic, it did not specifically warn that it could produce a poisonous lethal gas when applied to wet ice, which was below the chemical industry standard.

The jury heard evidence that the company had prior knowledge of other deaths caused by the same chemical and did not change the warning label accordingly. Testimony revealed a recommendation from the United States Coast Guard to the company's predecessor in 1973, advising them to warn users of the chemical about the dangers when used aboard vessels, specifically the potential to release lethal sulfur dioxide gas. These prior incidents had not led to changes in the warning labels.

Other evidence showed that the decedents resided with their parents, had a close familial relationship, and contributed all of their income to the household, sharing in many family activities. The trial also detailed the events leading to their deaths and the physical and emotional pain they suffered during the poisoning process, which ultimately led to their asphyxiation.

Verdict:
The court upheld the trial court judgment awarding actual and exemplary damages to the decedents' parents. The jury's findings regarding the inadequacy of the warning labels are expected to be supported based on the detailed evidence including expert testimony, demonstrating that the warnings did not specify the fatal risks of the product. The evidence of General Chemical's knowledge of past deaths and lack of subsequent action to modify the warnings would support the jury's determination that this constitutes "gross negligence," justifying an award for exemplary damages.

Given the emotional and financial contributions of the decedents to their parents' lives, the courts would likely find the claims for wrongful death to be reasonable. The pecuniary and non-pecuniary awards including loss of companionship and society, and mental anguish, would be upheld in light of the details of the previously close parent-child relationship and the substantial impact of the loss on the parents' lives, which was supported by psychological expert testimony and firsthand accounts.

The court would likely also reject the constitutional challenge raised by General Chemical against the exemplary damages awarded, as previous precedent and statutory law provide sufficient due process protections for defendants in such cases. The court's rationale would probably emphasize that Texas law affords defendants a number of procedural safeguards and that the current system does not violate due process or equal protection clauses of the Constitution. Given the significant evidence of the company's conscious indifference and failure to warn about the life-threatening dangers of their product, such an award would be seen as a necessary punitive measure and deterrent against future negligence.
