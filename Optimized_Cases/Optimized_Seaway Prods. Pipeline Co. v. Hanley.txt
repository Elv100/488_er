Background:
In the late 1980s, Tom Chambers became the owner of a property that would later be associated with the legal case. Chambers formed Annetta Development Corporation (Annetta) on April 9, 1997, deeded the property to Annetta, and then Annetta, as the property owner, entered into a Development Agreement with Aledo Construction, Inc. (Aledo), identified as the developer. The property was intended to be laid out and sold to homebuilders. 

On April 22, 1998, Sean Knight Custom Homes, Inc. (Custom Homes) entered into a contract with Annetta to purchase Lot 26 of Phase 7 of the property. Subsequently, a warranty deed to Knight from Annetta was executed on June 15. The lot was then conveyed to Rick Bloomfield, who later transferred the lot on November 17, 1998, to his father, Richard A. Bloomfield, Sr., the lot's owner at the time of the incident under litigation. 

The incident in question occurred on April 5, 1999, when Melvin Walcott, while clearing the lot in preparation for construction, ruptured Seaway's pressurized pipeline with a backhoe tractor. Before this incident, Rick Bloomfield, with a power of attorney from his father, was supposed to close the sale of the lot to the prospective homeowners, the McWeeneys; however, the closing had to be rescheduled due to issues encountered by the McWeeneys. The McWeeneys had also hired Sean Knight, owner of Custom Homes and Bloomfield, Sr.'s son-in-law, to build a house on the lot. However, the sale had not yet closed when the accident occurred.

Following the rupture, various claims were brought against Seaway, ARCO, Knight, Custom Homes, Walcott, and others involved in the development and sale of the subdivision lot, including Doyle Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta by adjoining lot owners Tim and Ashley McAuliffe. Seaway asserted cross-claims against the existing defendants, added third-party defendants, including Bloomfield, Sr., and settled with the McAuliffes. Seaway's cross-claims and third-party claims were the only matters left in this cause.

Among other claims, Seaway alleged that Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta were negligent in several ways including in platting the lot such that the pipeline crossed the front, mislocating the pipeline easement on the recorded plat, publicizing a sales map without reference to the pipeline, and failing to warn of the presence of the pipeline. Seaway claimed that Knight and Walcott were agents of Bloomfield, Sr., and that a joint enterprise was engaged with regard to the development and sale of the lot. Seaway also argued that Bloomfield, Sr., directly and through Knight and Walcott, failed to notify Seaway that excavation was to be conducted on the lot, as required by Texas law, and was liable under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act.

The trial court granted summary judgments in favor of the appellees, striking some of Seaway's evidence, including an affidavit that contained conclusory statements, and ruled that no joint enterprise existed between Bloomfield, Sr. and Knight. 

Verdict:
In analyzing the verdict, the court would likely consider the presented facts and determine whether the appellees owed a duty to Seaway and whether any such duty was breached, resulting in the pipeline rupture. Looking at the negligence claims, the court would examine the relationship between Bloomfield, Sr., Knight, and Walcott to determine if a joint enterprise existed or if Walcott acted as Bloomfield Sr.'s agent, employee, or independent contractor. From the details provided, it appears there was insufficient evidence to establish a joint enterprise or an agency relationship that would impute Walcott's actions to Bloomfield, Sr.

Concerning Bloomfield, Sr.'s knowledge of the excavation, the court would likely deduce that there was no evidence presented that he was aware of the planned excavation, nor did he have a legal duty to notify Seaway as required by the Texas Utilities Code. Additionally, the court would assess whether Bloomfield, Sr.'s property constituted a "solid waste facility" under the Texas Health and Safety Code, which would likely result in a finding that it did not, as the presence of the pipeline easement alone would not render the property a waste facility according to the law's definitions.

Addressing the negligence claims against Hanley, Aledo, Chambers, and Annetta, the court would analyze the connection between the platting of the lot and the causation of the pipeline rupture. The verdict would hinge on the lack of evidence demonstrating that the lot's configuration was a substantial factor in causing the rupture or that it was foreseeable to the appellees that such a rupture would occur due to their actions, including the alleged mislocating of the pipeline easement and omission of the pipeline on the sales map.

In summary, the court would affirm the summary judgment in favor of the property owners and developers based on an analysis of the detailed facts presented, which tended to show a lack of duty, breach, and proximate cause with regard to the claims made by Seaway against the appellees.
