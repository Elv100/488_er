Background: 
Roy Akers, owner of an ambulance service, instigated a lawsuit against Mrs. R. J. Epperson and her husband, seeking damages for a collision involving his ambulance and a car driven by Mrs. Epperson in San Antonio, Texas. The collision occurred near the intersection of San Pedro and Park Avenues when the ambulance, operated by J. P. Riley, collided with Mrs. Epperson's Dodge passenger car. The key issues in the case were the negligence of both drivers and the respective proximate cause of the collision.

During the trial, testimony was given indicating that the ambulance was traveling at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour before the collision, and evidence of skid marks 26 to 28 feet long on the pavement suggested the ambulance's speed at the time of braking. The skid marks became a significant point of contention in the trial. There was an assertion of jury misconduct raised by Akers, arguing that a juror, based on prior experience as a garage man, improperly influenced the jury by stating that the skid marks implied the ambulance was traveling at 40 miles per hour. Another point of contention was a juror visiting the scene of the accident, alleged to potentially influence his view of the case, although the claim was that the intersection had not changed since before the trial. Akers also challenged the jury's findings concerning whether the operator had proper control over the ambulance at the time of the collision, particularly against the jury's conclusion that the speed of the ambulance was a proximate cause of the collision.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's denial of recovery to the appellant, Roy Akers. In reaching this conclusion, the court will note that sufficient evidence supported the jury's findings of negligence and proximate cause regarding the speed of the ambulance operator. The skid marks on the pavement, along with the operator's testimony, will be viewed as substantial evidence to uphold the jury's verdict.

The court will reject Akers' argument concerning jury misconduct with respect to juror Boswell's opinion on the speed of the ambulance based on the skid marks. The court will find that jurors discussing evidence and drawing on personal experience is permissible, and Boswell's opinion will not be considered to carry undue expert weight, as jurors are allowed to consider evidence in light of their personal experiences, as long as no new evidence is brought into deliberations that was not presented in court. 

Regarding the visit to the accident scene, the court will determine that the juror's actions did not constitute misconduct, as he had not obtained any new information beyond what was already testified to during the trial. 

The court will also find no conflict in the jury's findings relating to the operator's control of the ambulance and the speed being a proximate cause of the accident. The reasoning will conclude that all the elements, including foreseeability and the situation of the injured party concerning the wrongful act, were appropriately considered by the jury. The court will determine that the ambulance's speed, even if it could not have been expected to lead to the precise incident that occurred, was reasonably anticipated to lead to a general type of injury under the circumstances.

Overall, the court will dismiss the appellant's contentions, upholding the lower court's judgment, and no new trial will be granted based on the arguments provided. The detailed evidence from the trial, juror behavior, and legal interpretation of negligence and proximate cause will all support this verdict.
