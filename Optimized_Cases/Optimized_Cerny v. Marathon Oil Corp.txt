Background:
The Cernys moved into a home in Karnes County, Texas, in 2002 and leased their mineral rights to Marathon's predecessor in 2010, which led to oil and gas operations and the creation of the Brysch-Adams Unit near their property. The Cernys did not have any physical infrastructure placed on their property by Marathon, but received consistent royalty payments from the operations. In 2013, the Cernys filed suit against Marathon Oil Corporation and Marathon Oil EF, LLC (collectively "Marathon"), as well as Plains Exploration & Production Company (Plains), citing harm from toxic emissions, exacerbated health problems, new health problems, and property damage due to oilfield operations surrounding their home.

The Cernys claimed that Marathon and Plains' negligence and production activities resulted in various issues, including offensive odors, constant traffic, dust, and noise, changing their quiet, rural lifestyle. The Cernys specifically filed for private nuisance, negligence, gross negligence, and negligence per se, seeking compensation for medical expenses, loss of earning capacity, physical and mental pain and suffering, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of use of their property, remediation damages, loss of market value of their property, and punitive damages.

In response, Marathon and Plains filed motions for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, focusing on lack of evidence of causation. The trial court granted defendants' motions to strike the majority of the Cernys' evidence as inadmissible. This left only the affidavit of the Cernys' minor son and two experts' affidavits (without their full reports). Consequently, the trial court granted summary judgment motions filed by Marathon and Plains. The Cernys appealed the decision, emphasizing that not all their claims required expert testimony under Havner and that lay affidavits and non-medical expert testimony were sufficient to establish causation.

Verdict:
The trial court judgment will be affirmed, upholding the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Marathon and Plains. The case is characterized as a toxic tort claim, thus the Cernys were required to present expert testimony to prove causation under Havner standards, which apply to their claims despite their attempts to disclaim reliance on expert testimony by framing their damages as those for "comfort rather than disease”. Since the Cernys’ claims arise out of exposure to toxic emissions and nuisances claimed to be caused by nearby oil and gas operations, it is outside laypersons' general knowledge and demands expert evidence on causation.

The Cernys will have failed to present more than a scintilla of probative expert evidence regarding each of Havner’s causation prongs: they did not exclude alternative causes for their alleged injuries to a reasonable certainty; no expert evidence differentiates between pre-existing conditions and claimed new health problems; and there is a lack of evidence that specifically links Marathon and Plains to the prohibited emissions on the Cernys’ property. Additionally, testimony from the Cernys and lay witnesses will not constitute more than a scintilla of evidence causally linking Marathon and Plains to dust, noise, traffic, and foul odors experienced by the Cernys. Conclusory and speculative lay opinions will not meet the burden of proof for causation in nuisance claims, especially when there is no evidence identifying Marathon or Plains as the proximate cause of these conditions and not evidence excluding the participation of other nearby oil and gas operators.

On these grounds, the trial court will not be found to have erred in granting a no-evidence summary judgment for all of the Cernys' claims, including private nuisance and negligence, and the judgment will be sustained.
