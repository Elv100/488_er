Background:
On July 22, 2016, Anthony Henegar, his daughter Mason, his friends Dan Mohorc and Larry Scala, along with their daughters, embarked on a nighttime boating excursion on Cedar Creek Lake in Texas. The boat was a 2010 pleasure boat owned by Anthony, and they left from the Henegars' lakehouse around 11 p.m.

During the trip, the teenage girls were allowed to drive the boat. At approximately 11:30 p.m., Sierra, Larry's fifteen-year-old daughter, was driving the boat when they became lost, entered a cove, and approached a bridge for Texas Highway 198. Larry took control but misjudged the height of the bridge and collided with it while attempting to pass underneath. The crash resulted in serious injuries to Anthony, who suffered a traumatic brain injury, and the death of Dan Mohorc.

After the collision, Mason attempted to direct Larry back to their lakehouse but was unsuccessful. Larry then docked the boat at the nearest available location, where a good Samaritan assisted them and called emergency services. Responding agencies included Caney City Police Department, the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, and Texas Parks and Wildlife. Larry was arrested for intoxication manslaughter, but the charges were later dropped.

The Henegars (Anthony and his family) sued several defendants: the boat manufacturer (Regal Marine Industries, Inc.), the boat seller (Singleton Assets & Operations, LLC, d/b/a Phil Dill Boats), the compass part manufacturer (Rule Industries, LLC), and the producer and installer of the lighted tower speakers and underwater lights on the boat (Earmark, Inc.). The suit included claims under strict products liability, negligence, gross negligence, fraud, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Mason Henegar brought forward a claim for loss of consortium and bystander injury, and Drue Henegar, Anthony and Lori's other daughter, also brought a loss of consortium claim.

It was undisputed that Larry, Anthony, and Dan had consumed alcohol that evening before setting out and that they had taken alcohol aboard. Witnesses, including boat passengers, did not testify to having the boat's interior cockpit lights, navigation lights, speaker tower lights, or any other component lighting on at the time of the collision, nor did they attribute any lighting to their difficulties in visibility while operating the boat.

The Henegars enlisted three expert witnesses to support their case: an expert in human visual perception and accident reconstruction, an electrical engineer specialized in accident reconstruction and human factors, and an expert in industrial/organization psychology and risk analysis. These experts testified that the boat's lighting features and windshield, as well as occupants seated at the front, interfered with Larry's visibility and ability to judge the bridge's height, thus contributing to the collision. They claimed these combined factors were the producing cause of the accident.

All defendants filed motions for traditional and/or no-evidence summary judgment, asserting that the Henegars failed to substantiate a genuine issue of material fact regarding causation. The trial court granted the summary judgment motions in favor of the defendants, leading to the dismissal of all of the Henegars' claims, and the Henegars subsequently appealed.

Verdict:
In this appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for all defendants, deeming there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the causation element of the Henegars' claims. The court's reasoning hinges heavily upon the testimonies provided, particularly the lack of evidence showing the boat's cockpit and speaker lights were on at the time of the collision.

Predicting the verdict reasoning, it is likely to focus on the quality of evidence the Henegars presented regarding the causation of the collision. The court will scrutinize whether the expert testimony effectively linked the alleged defects and negligence of the defendants to the accident's causation. It will consider whether the cockpit and tower lights were indeed on at the time of the collision and if they substantially contributed to the incident.

Despite affidavits and simulations provided by the experts, the verdict will take into account direct testimonies from those present at the time of the crash, none of whom recalled any lights being on that might impede visibility. The reasoning may also underscore inconsistencies and lack of memories related to crucial details, such as which lights, if any, were activated during the collision, due to the darkness mentioned and alcohol consumption.

Furthermore, the court will likely reason that since no evidence or testimony directly attributed the boat's lighting features or other components as a contributing factor to the collision, and because of the inconsistent memory recollections among witnesses, this lack of specific facts fails to create more than a mere suspicion or surmise regarding causation. The court will draw attention to the fact that the experts' opinions aggregated the various potential hazards rather than isolating the lighting as a crucial factor in the accident, diminishing the strength of the causation argument.

The court will conclude that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of each defendant on all of the Henegars' primary claims due to a failure to establish causation. Thus, the verdict will uphold the dismissal of additional claims related to loss of consortium and gross negligence, as these are derivative and contingent on establishing the primary claim of negligence or product liability.
