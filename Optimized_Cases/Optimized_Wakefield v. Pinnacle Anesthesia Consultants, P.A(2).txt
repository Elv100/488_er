Background:
Seventy-one-year-old George Wakefield underwent surgery to repair an ankle fracture and was administered anesthesia by Steve I.O. Wilson, M.D., using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). George Wakefield had a complicated medical history, which included lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and esophageal cancer for which he had an esophagectomy and a gastric pull-up procedure, leaving him at a high risk for aspiration during the surgery. After the surgery, George was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which led to acute respiratory failure and subsequently his death.

George's wife, Ellen S. Wakefield, and his son, Vann Doyle Wakefield, sued Pinnacle Anesthesia Consultants, P.A., claiming that the use of the LMA instead of an endotracheal tube with an inflatable cuff (ETT) caused George's aspiration and death. They further alleged a lack of informed consent on the risks associated with the LMA procedure. Their designated expert, Steven Schrenzel, M.D., testified that the use of the LMA was contraindicated for George due to his high risk of aspiration and that its use proximately caused his death. Schrenzel opined that an ETT would have been safer in preventing aspiration for a high-risk patient like George.

However, on Pinnacle's motion, the trial court excluded Schrenzel's testimony as scientifically unreliable and then entered a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Pinnacle. On appeal, Wakefield argued that the trial court erred in striking Schrenzel's testimony, in granting Pinnacle's no-evidence motion for summary judgment on negligence claims, and on the informed-consent claim.

Verdict:
The appellate court found that Schrenzel's opinion on the medical standard of care was scientifically reliable due to his extensive clinical experience, the package insert for the LMA, and medical literature supporting his view that an ETT was indicated over an LMA for a high-risk patient like George.

On the other hand, the appellate court predicted that Schrenzel's opinion on medical causation would be deemed unreliable, as the evidence showed no clinical signs of aspiration during the surgery and it was equally plausible that aspiration occurred postoperatively. Schrenzel could not adequately support the likelihood that aspiration during surgery was more likely, lacking personal clinical experience of silent intra-operative aspirations that manifested post-operatively and without broad reading of medical literature to support his opinion. As a result, the court would likely find that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on the negligence claims due to the lack of admissible testimony on proximate cause.

Regarding the informed consent claim, the court would predict that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Pinnacle. The rightfully obtained informed consent through compliance with List A, which covers general anesthesia, would be regarded as effective, and any claims of misrepresentation would not rebut the presumption without allegations of the invalidity of the consent form itself, such as forgery or lack of capacity.

Thus, the appellate court would likely affirm the trial court's judgment, supporting the verdict in favor of Pinnacle on both the negligence and informed consent claims.
