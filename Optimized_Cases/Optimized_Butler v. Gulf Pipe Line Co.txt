Background:
The appellant, Joe Butler, was an employee working on the appellee's (Gulf Pipe Line Company) oil pipeline in Tyler County, Texas. Butler sustained injuries while repairing a pipeline when a pool of oil he was standing in ignited. He posited two theories for the cause of the fire. First, he contended that the ignition was due to lightning conducted into the ground near the pipeline by a ground wire from the employer's telephone line. He argued that the employer was negligent in placing the telephone line and ground wire in close proximity to the pipeline. Second, he alternatively alleged that the fire was started by his foreman, Hardy Jenkins, who lit a cigarette, threw the match, and thus ignited the pool of oil—constituting negligence for which the employer should be held liable. 

The trial court sustained a general demurrer to Butler's amended petition which argued that the employer had been negligent in four ways: (1) by placing wires or lightning arresters close to the pipe line, (2) through the foreman's act of throwing a lighted match, (3) by failing to warn Butler of working dangers while lightning was flashing, and (4) by employing a foreman who would strike a match near a pool of oil. The trial court dismissed the action when Butler declined to further amend his suit, prompting this appeal. 

Verdict:
The court affirmed the lower court's decision by holding the following: Regarding the placement of lightning arresters, the employer could not have reasonably foreseen injury due to lightning in a similar manner to the plaintiff's injuries, thus they did not meet the standard for proximate cause. Concerning the foreman lighting a cigarette, the act, even if negligent and the proximate cause of Butler's injuries, was not done in furtherance of the employer’s business but for the foreman's personal pleasure. Therefore, the employer would not be liable as the act took place outside the scope of the foreman’s employment. 

As Butler did not present the argument of the employer's failure to warn of the dangers of working during lightning, this point was not addressed in detail. However, it was noted that an employer is not duty-bound to warn about unforeseeable dangers. 

Regarding the employment of the foreman who would strike a match next to a pool of oil, the court determined that the petition did not allege habitual negligence or negligence known to the employer. Since the employer is only expected to exercise ordinary care in selecting employees, a single act of negligence by an employee (the foreman) does not prove employer negligence in hiring. 

Finally, if the oil ignited as a natural consequence of a law of nature (lightning seeking a path of least resistance), the plaintiff would have had as much knowledge of this danger as the employer, which would not constitute negligence on the employer's part. Hence, the general demurrer was properly sustained as the plaintiff's petition failed to establish that the employer's actions were the proximate cause of his injuries. The court's judgment was therefore affirmed.
