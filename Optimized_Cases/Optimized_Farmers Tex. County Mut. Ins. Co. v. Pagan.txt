Background:
Ashlee Elizabeth Pagan was involved in a car accident in March 2008 when her truck was struck by another vehicle, causing various injuries including to her neck and left shoulder. She filed a lawsuit alleging that the driver of the other vehicle was negligent and sought coverage under her underinsured motorist insurance policy with Farmers Texas County Mutual Insurance Company. Farmers was added to the lawsuit after Pagan settled with the other driver. The key issues at trial were the cause and extent of Pagan's injuries.

Before the trial commenced, the court granted Pagan's motion in limine to prevent Farmers from referencing any injuries suffered post-2008 crash or an incident in April 2009 when Pagan was allegedly pushed down by a spooked horse. Pagan testified about the physical effects of the car accident, her hospital visit the following day, and her continuous pain in her neck and shoulder. Her boyfriend corroborated her account, detailing the negative impact of the crash on her abilities and participation in life activities. Pagan's orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Beaudry, associated her current shoulder problems with the crash and predicted she would need future shoulder surgery costing between $20,000 to $25,000.

Farmers attempted to present evidence relating to the April 2009 horse incident, arguing it was a potential cause of the injuries. However, Pagan successfully excluded this evidence, with the court finding no evidence that the horse incident caused her neck and shoulder injuries, suggesting it would only confuse the jury. The jury ruled in favor of Pagan, awarding her $50,000 in damages, which was offset by a $25,000 settlement from the driver of the car, resulting in a final judgment of $25,000 plus interest. Farmers appealed on the basis that the court abused its discretion in excluding evidence related to the horse incident and that the evidence supporting Pagan's injuries was factually insufficient.

Verdict:
Affirmed. The appellate court upheld the trial court's judgment, rejecting Farmers' contentions. It concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence related to the 2009 horse incident under Tex. R. Evid. 403 and 702. There was no showing by Farmers that the horse incident was a plausible cause of the injuries at issue. Even if causality between the incident and the injuries was considered, the proffered evidence was merely temporal correlations without substantive causation and could confuse the jury. Dr. Beaudry's opinion, although acknowledging a trampling could potentially cause similar injuries, was deemed as not based on the factual history of Pagan's case and therefore unreliable.

Farmers failed to prove a new causal explanation plausible enough to be presented to the jury, and any error in evidentiary exclusion was not harmful given the comprehensive testimonies provided by Pagan and her medical experts. The evidence of Pagan reporting neck and shoulder problems post-crash, alongside Dr. Beaudry's testimony linking the issues to the crash, was factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Statements made by Dr. Beaudry during deposition about the potential of a horse trampling causing similar injuries were speculative and did not offer a concrete alternative cause. The testimony was appropriately excluded to prevent the jury from speculating based on limited and non-probative information that could mislead the deliberation process.

Farmers' appeal focused heavily on the potential causal link between the 2009 horse incident and Pagan's injuries, but the appellate court found the evidence Farmers sought to introduce was speculative and not directly relevant to the specific injuries for which Pagan sought damages. The verdict did not depend on this excluded evidence, and the jury was entitled to rely on the evidence that was properly admitted under the rules of evidence. Therefore, Farmers' arguments were overruled, and the trial court's judgment was affirmed.
