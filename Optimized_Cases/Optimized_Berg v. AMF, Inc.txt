Background:
Orville Berg worked for AMF Tuboscope, Canada—situated in Alberta, Canada—which is a subsidiary of AMF Tuboscope, Inc., based in Houston, Texas. During his employment spanning eleven years, Berg cleaned and coated pipes by sandblasting and spraying a coating mixture manufactured by Tuboscope in Houston and shipped to Canada. Berg developed several medical conditions, such as occupational lung asthma, pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chemical sensitization due to exposure to chemicals and dust. The Canadian Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) provided Berg with benefits from 1974, and he continued to receive them until at least October 1998. The Bergs filed a lawsuit against the appellees (AMF Inc. and others) in Harris County, Texas. However, the trial court dismissed the case on the grounds of forum non conveniens, a doctrine allowing courts to decline jurisdiction if it is significantly inconvenient and a more appropriate forum exists elsewhere. This dismissal decision was based on the principle that Berg had an adequate remedy under Canadian law, the majority of evidence and witnesses were Canadian, and a direct view of the plant where Berg was exposed would be imperative. The appellants had argued that the appellees' act or omission occurred in Houston, Texas, and that the appellees failed to satisfy the statutory factors of forum non conveniens under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, section 71.051. However, the trial court found that appellees met the burden of proof in demonstrating that Canada was the more appropriate forum.

Verdict:
The judgment was affirmed, indicating that the dismissal was correctly applied. Even though some documents and evidence related to the manufacture of the chemicals were in Texas, the place of exposure and most witnesses were in Canada. The remedy available under Canadian law was considered adequate, and there was significant emphasis on the benefit of having the trial closer to the location of the plant for the practicality of viewing its condition. The appellee’s motion to dismiss succeeded on the grounds that they had sufficiently demonstrated by preponderance of the evidence that each of the necessary elements for forum non conveniens applied. These elements included the existence of an alternative forum (Canada), where the Bergs could try their claim; an adequate remedy available in Canada; and considerations of private and public interests favoring the Canadian forum due to the location of witnesses, evidence, and application of Canadian law. Additionally, maintaining the suit in Texas would cause a substantial injustice to the appellees due to the location of evidence and the related costs. The appellants’ argument that an exception to the dismissal under section 71.051(f) should apply because the injury was caused by an act or omission in Texas did not hold since they failed to provide credible evidence establishing a causal nexus between the appellee's conduct in Texas and Berg’s injury in Canada. Without verified evidence relating the Texas-manufactured chemicals to the injuries sustained by Berg, the appellants did not meet the burden under section 71.051(f) to prevent dismissal.
