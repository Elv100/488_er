Background: The case concerns a wrongful death and survival action brought by plaintiffs, the estate of Darla Blackmon and her daughter Sheila Shultz, against the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) after Blackmon died from pneumonia while incarcerated at a Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facility where UTMB provided medical services. Blackmon, who was undergoing alcoholism treatment, fell ill in December 2000 and sought medical attention on multiple occasions in January 2001 without being referred to a physician, ordered diagnostic tests, or receiving antibiotics. During her last visit to UTMB medical services, Nurse Lancaster used a stethoscope and pulse oxymeter to assess Blackmon's condition but sent her back to her room without detecting her severe pneumonia. Blackmon died the next morning from asphyxiation caused by untreated pneumonia. Shultz claimed a waiver of sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), alleging that Blackmon's death was proximately caused by the negligent use of tangible personal property, specifically a stethoscope and pulse oxymeter. UTMB argued that Shultz did not sufficiently plead or show that the use of tangible property proximately caused the death and filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the trial court denied. UTMB appealed the decision.

Verdict: The court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny UTMB's plea to the jurisdiction. In reaching this decision, the court will recognize that Shultz's claim fell within the TTCA's statutory waiver. The court will acknowledge that traditional proximate cause analysis under TTCA does not require the tangible property itself, such as the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter, to be the instrument of harm. Rather, it requires a sufficient causal nexus between the negligent use—or misuse—of such property and the victim's death. The court will emphasize that UTMB's use of the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter must be more than mere involvement with the property; it must have actually contributed causally to the death. The court will focus on whether Shultz has adequately alleged that the negligent use or misuse of the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter was a substantial factor in bringing about the death, and that, but for the negligence alleged, the pneumonia would have been detected, and Blackmon's life could have been saved.

The court will further distinguish this case from precedents where there was no direct misuse of property or where misuse did not result in harm. It will assert that the alleged negligent actions of the UTMB providers are neither too temporally attenuated from Blackmon's death nor too weak in their causal relationship to remove them from TTCA's waiver of immunity. The court will predict that the ruling will be made on the basis that the stethoscope and pulse oxymeter were tangible personal property used with the purpose of detecting the very conditions that led to Blackmon's death, and the alleged misuse of these tools nine hours before her death is alleged to have directly impacted the failure to treat her life-threatening condition, leading to the lung failure that caused her death, thereby satisfying the use-of-property criterion required by TTCA for waiver of sovereign immunity.
