Background:
Dr. Emily Archer, a gynecologist, began treating Anita Warren in 1988 for pelvic pain, and successfully performed a hysterectomy surgery. In a 1990 examination, Anita complained of symptoms indicative of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which was diagnosed as such by Dr. Archer. Anita's condition included a cystocele, a herniation of the bladder through the vaginal wall, which was noted to have progressed by 1993. During a 1995 examination, Dr. Archer discovered Anita's condition had further advanced, leading her to recommend surgery to correct the cystourethrocele (bladder herniation involving the urethra), a rectocele (herniation of the rectum through the vaginal wall), and the SUI. Dr. Archer did not discuss Kegel's exercises with Anita â€” exercises intended to strengthen pelvic floor muscles. Post-surgery, Anita developed nerve damage in her right leg causing persistent pain.

Anita and her husband filed a suit against Dr. Archer alleging medical negligence. Their claim centered on four main points: (1) the doctor failed to offer the non-surgical option of Kegel's exercises, (2) Anita would have chosen and performed the exercises if offered, (3) Kegel's exercises probably would have corrected her incontinence without surgery, and (4) surgery could have been avoided, thus preventing nerve damage.

The trial jury found Dr. Archer's negligence to be a proximate cause of Anita's injury, and the judgment was entered in favor of the Warrens for damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest. Dr. Archer appealed, contending the evidence was legally insufficient to support the findings of negligence and proximate cause, among other issues. Emphasis was placed on the legal insufficiency of evidence that Kegel's exercises would have likely prevented surgery.

Verdict:
The appeal from Dr. Archer will highlight the insufficiency of evidence regarding whether Anita would have successfully avoided surgery through the performance of Kegel's exercises. Focusing on causation, Dr. Archer will assert that there is no conclusive evidence supporting the notion that Anita, as an individual with her specific conditions, would have probably improved with Kegel's to a degree that surgery would be unnecessary. This assertion hinges upon a lack of specific criteria to identify patients who could actually be helped by Kegel's exercises and an expert's inability to predict reasonable medical probability of avoiding surgery through their use.

The court will likely find that the studies presented provided general statistics on SUI improvement with Kegel's exercises but failed to distinguish between the improvement levels necessary to forego surgery. The expert witness testimony will be scrutinized for relying on assumed facts not aligned with actual, undisputed facts of the case, rendering the testimony without probative value. 

Overall, the evidence will be determined to be legally insufficient due to its speculative nature and inability to establish a causal link between the failure to recommend Kegel's exercises and Anita's continued SUI and subsequent nerve damage with reasonable medical probability. As the proof offered did not meet the required standard of showing that the alleged negligence was a substantial factor in causing Anita's harm, and no criteria were provided to judge the likelihood of the exercises being a successful alternative to surgery for Anita specifically, the judgment in favor of the Warrens will be reversed. The court will predict that the outcome of the appeal will result in a new judgment that the Warrens take nothing.
