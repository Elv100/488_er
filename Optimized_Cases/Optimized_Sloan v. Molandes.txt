Background:
Plaintiff patient, Lisa Molandes, brought a medical malpractice action against defendant doctor, Lance Sloan, M.D., regarding injurious side effects caused by the use of steroids prescribed by Dr. Sloan. Lisa Molandes saw Dr. Sloan in 1993 for gestational diabetes, and he later became her primary physician. Molandes was diagnosed with minimal change disease or focal segmental glumerulosclerosis, for which Dr. Sloan prescribed the steroid drug Prednisone.

Molandes experienced several side effects from taking Prednisone, which she conveyed to Dr. Sloan, but he did not taper the medication. Molandes then sought a second opinion on March 20, 1996, from Dr. Thomas Lowery, who advised immediate tapering. The following day, Molandes was hospitalized with severe abdominal pains diagnosed as acute necrotizing pancreatitis. She was transferred to a Houston hospital and left in a wheelchair with leg braces, having contracted lower extremity neuropathy as a result.

At trial, expert witnesses, including Dr. Peter Howard Jones and Dr. Tom Petty, testified that Dr. Sloan violated the standard of care by continuing steroid therapy and not responding to side effects. The triglyceride elevation caused by the Prednisone was identified as a significant factor leading to Molandes' pancreatitis. Experts also linked the long-term high-dose steroid use to Molandes' injuries, including pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pancreatic pseudocyst, relapsing pancreatitis, and critical illness neuropathy.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's ruling and judgment in favor of Molandes based on the following reasoning:

The evidence presented at trial, including expert testimony, will support the jury's conclusion that Dr. Sloan's prolonged prescription of steroids was a proximate cause of Molandes' injuries. A reasonable jury could find from this evidence that Molandes' use of steroids for an extended period led to her developing pancreatitis and lower extremity neuropathy, both of which were foreseeable risks. The experts' opinions will establish that it was reasonably medically probable that Dr. Sloan's negligence caused Molandes' injuries, meeting the standard required to establish proximate cause.

The defense might argue that the evidence was insufficient because it did not conclusively show that Dr. Sloan's treatment was the definitive cause of Molandes' injuries, as other possible causes were not ruled out. However, in medical malpractice cases, the plaintiff is not required to prove that the defendant's actions were the only possible cause of injury but rather that the defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injuries, which Molandes' testimony and expert evidence will sufficiently demonstrate.

Furthermore, the other factors that potentially contributed to Molandes' condition, such as hypothyroidism, nephritic syndrome, and medications such as Accutane and Bactrim, will not be proven to be more likely causes of her injuries than the negligence of Dr. Sloan. The weight of the evidence will support the conclusion that Dr. Sloan's prescription of steroids significantly contributed to Molandes' condition.

Given these considerations, the court will determine that Molandes has met her burden of demonstrating that Dr. Sloan's negligence was a substantial factor in her injuries, and as such, the jury's finding and award of damages to Molandes will be upheld. No sanctions for a frivolous appeal will be warranted, as Dr. Sloan's appeal will be deemed not frivolous, despite being unsuccessful.
