Background:
Alberto Perez Jr. ("Albert"), a minor son of the plaintiff, reached out to the owners of ABC Lock and Key Company, Albert Lopez and Rachel Lopez, to make a new key for the trigger lock on his rifle after he lost the original key. Rachel informed him that she could not create a new key, but if Albert brought the unloaded rifle and proper identification to their shop, she could pick the lock. A conversation with a joking tone about the use of the gun ensued, with Rachel asking if Albert planned to rob anybody and Albert laughing off the inquiry, stating his intent to go hunting.

Albert Lopez, co-owner, attempted to verify with someone at Albert's home that he was the rightful possessor of the rifle but was unsuccessful. Despite the lack of verification, Rachel proceeded to pick the lock at her husband's instruction and returned the operational rifle to the minor after he paid a service fee.

The plaintiff had found the rifle which belonged to his older son in his house a week before Albert's suicide but did not secure it from his son. On the day Alberto Jr. committed suicide, the plaintiff took the rifle to work to potentially sell it to a colleague, found out the trigger lock was removed, and returned the rifle to where he found it, despite knowing his minor son would be at his house that day.

The plaintiff filed a wrongful death and survival action against the owners of the lock and key company, arguing that their negligence in unlocking the trigger lock and handing the now operational rifle back to his underage son without consent was a proximate cause of his son's subsequent suicide.

At trial, the plaintiff testified to suffering mental anguish and depression post the son's death, corroborated by professional medical opinions and observations by his daughter. Despite this, the jury awarded no damages for past or future mental anguish or loss of companionship to the plaintiff. The jury did find all parties negligent, apportioning responsibility 33% to Alberto Sr., and 34% and 33% to Albert and Rachel Lopez, respectively. It awarded the estate $5,000 for funeral and burial expenses. The defendants motioned for a directed verdict, claiming there was no evidence the suicide was foreseeable or that their actions were a proximate cause.

Verdict:
I predict that the appellate court will undertake a meticulous examination of the jury's decisions, the evidence presented, and pertinent legal principles before determining the verdict. In analyzing the verdict of no damages for mental anguish and loss of companionship, the appellate court will reiterate the established legal principle that the jurors, as the sole judges of credibility, have the discretion to weigh evidence and resolve conflicts within it. It will consider the testimony provided by both the plaintiff and supporting witnesses, weigh it against the jury's determination, and decide if the verdict was egregiously against the great weight of the evidence to an extent that it appears manifestly unjust. 

The court will likely scrutinize the ruling of the trial court concerning the evidentiary and jury instruction errors claimed by the appellant. Regarding the evidence excluded by the trial court, the appellate court will assess if an offer of proof was properly made and whether excluding the evidence was harmful enough to reverse. 

Regarding the jury instruction error concerning negligence per se based on Texas Penal Code Sections 46.01(3) and 46.06(a)(2), the appellate court will analyze whether the statutes at issue clearly define the conduct to be prohibited and whether the injury that occurred is the type of injury the statutes were designed to prevent.

For determining foreseeability in the case of the wrongful death, the appellate court will explore whether the defendants could have reasonably anticipated the minor misusing the firearm in such a way that might have led to his suicide. They will consider if the defendants' actions were a substantial factor in the death, whether the suicide was a danger that a person of ordinary intelligence should have anticipated due to their negligence, and whether the injury's general character could have been anticipated.

In the end, the court will conclude whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence and proximate cause, and whether the jury's determination that no damages should be awarded was disproportionate to the evidence of the plaintiff's mental anguish and loss of companionship. If the court finds the jury's verdict was just and supported by the evidence, they will affirm the trial court's judgment; otherwise, they may reverse the judgment and opt for a new trial if procedural errors significantly affected the trial's outcome or the judgment rendered was manifestly unjust.
