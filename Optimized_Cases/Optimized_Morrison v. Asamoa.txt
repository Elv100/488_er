Background:
Sylvia Morrison underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy performed by Dr. Kathryn Hutton, an employee of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Odessa (TTUHSC), on January 17, 2018. During the surgery, Sylvia sustained an injury to her ureter resulting in urine leakage into her peritoneal cavity. This led to various infections and resulted in her hospitalization at Midland Memorial Hospital on January 29, 2018, for symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, sepsis, acute renal failure, and a high white blood cell count.

Over her 54-day hospital stay, Sylvia was seen by several physicians, including Dr. Hutton, as well as Dr. Nancy Asamoa, Dr. Rachna Bharti, Dr. Hayan Orfaly, Dr. Asif Ansari, Dr. Satish Mocherla, and Dr. John McKenna, and was also under the care of Permian Premier Health Services, Inc. Numerous tests and medical procedures were carried out, but her ureteral injury and subsequent issues remained undiagnosed until March 8, 2018, when a consulting urologist, Dr. Michael Dragun, correctly diagnosed the injury.

Despite the evidence of hydronephrosis on the ultrasound conducted on the day of her admission, and the presence of symptoms like ascites and pleural effusions, none of the physicians, including Dr. Hutton, considered a ureteral injury in their differential diagnosis, which Dr. James Paine, the expert witness, opined should have been included. It was only after weeks of hospitalization that the correct diagnosis was made, and a nephrostomy was performed on March 9, 2018, which allowed Sylvia to improve and eventually be discharged to a rehabilitation and care facility on March 23, 2018.

The appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that their medical expert report was deficient and in granting six separate motions to dismiss Appellants' health care liability claims against seven of the appellees. TTUHSC also filed an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss, claiming a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA).

Verdict:
Regarding the claim against TTUHSC, the court will reverse the trial court's order and will render a judgment of dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity. Appellants failed to plead facts that would establish a waiver of TTUHSC's sovereign immunity based on the use of tangible personal property. Specifically, Appellants did not allege a condition or use of tangible real or personal property in their pleadings, which is necessary to demonstrate a waiver under Section 101.021(2) of the TTCA. The claims against TTUHSC are purely of non-use, which is insufficient to waive sovereign immunity. No revision of factual details or pleadings could change this.

Regarding the remaining Appellees, the court will find that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motions to dismiss based on the adequacy of Appellants' expert reports. Dr. James Paine's expert reports will be deemed as having made a good faith effort to comply with the Texas Medical Liability Act's requirements and will provide a fair summary of his opinion on the causal relationship between the defendants' breaches of the applicable standard of care and Sylvia Morrison's injuries. Dr. Paine's qualifications to render an opinion on the standard of care in this case will be upheld based on his extensive experience and knowledge in managing and caring for hysterectomy patients and diagnosing common postoperative complications, such as Sylvia's ureteral injury.

Furthermore, Dr. Paine's reports will be sufficient in articulating a standard of care, explaining how each respective Appellee breached that standard, and demonstrating a causal relationship between the Appellees' failure to meet the standard of care and the injuries suffered by Sylvia Morrison. As a result, the dismissal of claims against Permian Premier Health Services, and Doctors Asamoa, McKenna, Mocherla, Orfaly, Ansari, and Bharti will be reversed, and those claims will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the appellate court.

The court will rule accordingly, restoring the Appellants' claims against the individual medical professionals and Permian while affirming the dismissal of claims against TTUHSC due to sovereign immunity.
