Background:
Refugio Sanchez, an employee of the independent contractor Precision Drilling Holdings Company (Holdings), was injured on a jobsite on April 30, 2013, resulting in the amputation of his leg. The injury occurred when he was transporting Precision Drilling Company, LP's (Precision) Rig 105 to a COG Operating LLC well site, as part of a separate contract COG had with Precision to drill several oil and gas wells, which included transportation known as "mobilization." Sanchez, along with his fellow Holdings employees Ivan Torres and Austin Matejowsky, was tasked with loading a portable generator onto a pole truck and relocating it. Using chains and rope as directed by Torres, Sanchez secured the generator to the truck. While Matejowsky directed Torres to back the truck up, the generator began swinging, and as Sanchez attempted to control it, the pole truck ran over his leg and foot.

Sanchez filed a negligence lawsuit against Precision, claiming it breached its duty to maintain a safe work environment during the mobilization. Precision filed for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, which the trial court granted without specifying the grounds, resulting in the dismissal of the lawsuit.

In the summary judgment process, the trial court applied a standard that required considering all evidence favorable to the nonmovant (Sanchez), resolving doubts in his favor. To defeat the no-evidence motion, Sanchez needed to present at least a scintilla of evidence, meaning enough to enable reasonable and fair-minded individuals to differ in their conclusions regarding an essential element of his claimâ€”such as cause-in-fact of his injuries.

Sanchez's primary arguments for causation were focused on Precision employee Ricky Menard's actions, including distracting Matejowsky and not identifying and correcting multiple workplace hazards. In support, Sanchez presented a report by his expert, Douglas W. Smith, who cited Precision's failure to ensure adequate procedures and a safe worksite. Smith's report listed nine contributing factors to the accident, sourced mostly from Holdings' Serious Incident Investigation Report, but didn't clearly connect these factors to any act or omission attributable to Precision.

Verdict:
The trial court's summary judgment in favor of Precision will be affirmed because Sanchez would not have provided sufficient evidence to show that any action or omission by Precision was the cause-in-fact of his injuries. Cause-in-fact refers to whether Precision's alleged negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Sanchez's injury, and whether the injury would not have occurred without it. Given expert witness Smith's failure to specify which of the nine contributing factors were attributable to Menard and lacking clear evidence that Precision's failure to ensure adequate procedures or a safe worksite was a substantial factor in the accident, there would not be more than a scintilla of evidence linking Precision to the cause of Sanchez's injuries.

Since there would have been no more than conjecture as to the cause-in-fact aspect of proximate cause, additional considerations of duty and breach would not need to be addressed. Therefore, in predicting the verdict, Sanchez's claim would fail on the no-evidence summary judgment aspect, as he allegedly would not have provided the necessary evidence of causation required to defeat Precision's motion for summary judgment. Consequently, the trial court would have correctly dismissed Sanchez's suit, supporting the affirmation of the judgment.
