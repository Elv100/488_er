Background:
Harley R. Walker, the respondent property owner, initiated legal proceedings against several insurance companies—Houston Fire and Casualty Company and two others (the petitioners)—based on Builders Risk Insurance policies. Walker's claim involved damage to a reinforced concrete dam, which he asserted was caused by lightning. However, the insurance policies in question described Walker's brick veneer dwelling and did not include the concrete dam that was reportedly destroyed. Consequently, Walker sought a reformation of the policies, alleging mutual mistake, to encompass the dam. The insurance companies countered with a general denial, attributing the dam's damage to flood waters, not lightning, and contended that the dam was not covered under the policy's terms.

The trial court sided with the insurance companies, resulting in a judgment that Walker receive nothing. Walker then appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals based only on the trial court transcript, proclaiming that a statement of facts was unnecessary for an appellate decision. The insurance companies prepared a statement of facts, which was initially accepted by the appellate court, but later, an order was issued rescinding the acceptance of the statement of facts. The appellate court subsequently adjudged in favor of Walker based solely on the transcript, reforming the policies and issuing a judgment for the amount determined by the jury. The determination was based on the view that, according to the verdict, Walker was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

In response to the appellate court judgment, the insurers appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate court's decision to reverse the trial court's judgment based only on the transcript was erroneous, with several special issues decided by the trial court not being properly considered. The contention was that without a statement of facts, the appellate court should not have reversed the trial court’s judgment. Walker continued to maintain that the appellate court’s review should be based only on the trial transcript.

The Supreme Court’s review focused on the procedural aspects of the case instead of a full record, due to the absence of a statement of facts and because that was the central issue presented by the parties. The trial court's special issues and jury's answers indicated that the jury believed a tree near the dam was struck by lightning, but that the tree was not expelled from the ground by the strike, which might have been necessary for the tree to have caused the damage to the dam. The Court of Civil Appeals considered Special Issue No. 3, about the tree being expelled from the ground, to be immaterial, thus disregarding it and holding that respondents were entitled to judgment on the other issues.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court is slated to reverse the appellate court's judgment that rested solely on the trial transcript. The reversal will be based on the principle that without a statement of facts, an appellate court usually cannot and should not overturn a trial court's judgment. Specifically, in this instance, it's expected that the Supreme Court will hold that the appellate court erred in deeming Special Issue No. 3 as immaterial and in excluding it from consideration, as this was indeed a material issue based on the trial judge's submission of evidence and the importance of the issue in establishing causation for the damage.

The Supreme Court will likely emphasize the importance of the special issues decided by the jury—especially the negative response to Special Issue No. 3—which was central to establishing whether the tree’s being struck by lightning was a proximate cause of the damage to the dam. The lack of evidence supporting the jury's affirmative response to Special Issue No. 4, in light of the negative response to No. 3, will be highlighted, underscoring the principle that an appellate court cannot declare a trial court's finding that an issue was unsupported by evidence to be incorrect in the absence of a statement of facts.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court will conclude that the trial court implicitly found the causation evidence sufficient only for Special Issue No. 3, and when the jury answered it negatively, it left no evidence to support an affirmative answer to Special Issue No. 4. The decision will affirm the trial court's judgment of "take nothing" in favor of the insurers because the evidence on causation—an essential element of Walker's claim—was not found sufficient by the jury, thereby not warranting reformation of the insurance policies to include the dam. The Supreme Court's decision will validate the trial court's judgment as procedurally sound given the absence of a statement of facts to review.
