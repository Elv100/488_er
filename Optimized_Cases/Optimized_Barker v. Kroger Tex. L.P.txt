Background:
The appellant, Carolyn Barker, as administratrix of the estate of Amy Robinson, brought forth a case against The Kroger Company and Kroger Texas Limited Partnership (collectively referred to as "Kroger") after a tragic incident resulted in the death of Amy Robinson. Amy was abducted and murdered by two former Kroger employees, James Robert Neville, Jr., and Michael Wayne Hall, as she was en route to her job at Kroger, riding her bike. Both perpetrators had ceased working at Kroger four months before the murder.

The criminals had a history of criminal and supremacist beliefs, as evident by their reason for buying guns and a bet they had amongst themselves to "kill the most niggers." On the day of the murder, Neville and Hall, attempting to find a specific black man at Kroger, discovered from the work schedule that Amy was due for work. Neville knew her routine and the route she took to work. When they encountered Amy, they offered her a ride, which she accepted, and afterwards, they committed the murder.

Amy was described as mentally challenged, whereas Neville had a record of a previous felony conviction for burglary, which he disclosed when hired at Kroger. Amy and Neville knew each other from work and had developed a friendship; Amy had even accompanied Neville to a Kroger Christmas party after he had left the company.

The appellant in her ordinary negligence claim suggested that Kroger was negligent by allowing Neville and Hall access to the work schedule and by employing felons alongside individuals like Amy with mental challenges. There was no evidence that Kroger was aware of any violent tendencies from Neville or Hall, nor had they experienced any similar incidents where someone used a work schedule to locate and kill an employee.

Verdict:
The court will hold that the previous criminal conduct of Neville and Hall, particularly their acts leading to Amy's murder, were superseding causes that absolve Kroger from liability in this case. The court's reasoning will rely on a set of established considerations that reveal the murder as unforeseeable by Kroger. Specifically, the court will find that the harm inflicted, Amy's murder, was of a different nature than what could be anticipated from any alleged negligence by Kroger. Moreover, the court will consider the act of murder to be extraordinary and not a normal consequence of the work environment or any alleged negligence, such as the posting of work schedules that could lead to such a crime.

Additionally, the friendship developed between Amy and Neville, with no evidence of fear or apprehension from Amy, underlines the unpredictability of the crime. There was no indication that Kroger could have foreseen Neville's and Hall's affiliation with supremacist beliefs or violent intentions. As the abduction occurred off the company's premises and during a period when Neville and Hall were no longer employees, the court will deem this as an independent intervening force, not created by Krogerâ€™s alleged negligence.

Since Kroger successfully negated the element of foreseeability within the context of proximate cause, the burden shifted to the appellant to present countervailing evidence indicating such a crime could have been foreseen. The appellant failed to provide such evidence, resulting in the failure to meet the burden of proof.

In conclusion, based on the lack of foreseeable risk and absence of relevant evidence presented by the appellant that would suggest foreseeability, the court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Kroger, thereby dismissing the ordinary negligence claim. The company's lack of knowledge of any violent predispositions by the former employees and the extraordinary nature of the crime establish the murder as a superseding cause that Kroger could not have reasonably anticipated, hence absolving the company of ordinary negligence in this incident.
