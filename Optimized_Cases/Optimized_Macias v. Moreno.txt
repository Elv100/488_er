Background:
Appellee Freddy Moreno Jr., a police officer with the Anthony Police Department, was indicted for violating the civil rights of a prisoner and released on a $1,000 bond. Moreno enlisted the appellant, attorney Francisco F. Macias, for his defense. Macias failed to inform Moreno about the final judge's conference, leading to Moreno's absence at the hearing. Consequently, the trial court revoked Moreno's bond and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno spent three weeks in jail following this due to unsuccessful attempts by Macias to have the bond reduced. After Moreno dismissed Macias, he hired another attorney, Anthony Gonzalez, and the charges against him were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence.

Moreno then sued Macias for legal malpractice, specifically alleging negligence, violations of the DTPA, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeking attorney's fees. The jury only considered the negligence claim and found Macias to be 90 percent responsible for Moreno's damages, assessing damages for mental anguish, lost wages, and legal fees paid to both Gonzalez and Macias. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Moreno for $39,150.

Macias raised three main issues for appeal: 1) whether Texas law prohibits maintaining a malpractice suit for damages arising from criminal charges without a conviction, 2) whether the trial court erred in refusing his requests for jury determinations regarding Moreno's guilt and related instructions on sole proximate cause of damages, and 3) whether the "unlawful act rule" bars Moreno's claims due to his failure to appear in court.

During the trial, Macias argued that Moreno's alleged criminal conduct was the sole proximate cause of the damages rather than any negligence by Macias. Macias also contended that because Moreno's absence from the conferenc was illegal, the unlawful act rule should bar his recovery for damages. Macias' arguments in court were based on disputing the causal link between his actions and Moreno's damages, suggesting Moreno's misconduct (alleged criminal acts and failure to appear) was the true cause.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment against Macias, upholding the jury's verdict awarding damages to Moreno. The appellant Macias waived his sole proximate cause argument by failing to properly plead in his defense that Moreno's criminal conduct was the sole cause of damages incurred. Moreover, the doctrine of sole proximate cause was not applicable because it only pertains to cases where the client was convicted, which did not occur for Moreno since his charges were dismissed.

The court will also maintain that the requested instructions and jury questions regarding Moreno's guilt and causation were not supported by the pleadings and evidence, making them improper and unsupportable by law. Thus, Macias was not entitled to these submissions, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to include such instructions for the jury.

Regarding the issue of the "unlawful act rule," since Moreno was not convicted, the act of failing to appear at the conference alone, without evidence of charging for bail jumping or an admission of the act, does not trigger the rule to bar recovery for malpractice damages. The negligence claim against Macias remained independent of any alleged unlawful acts by Moreno.

In conclusion, since all of Macias' issues are overruled, the appellate court sustains the jury's verdict and Macias' appeal will not succeed. The judgment in favor of Moreno is thus affirmed.
