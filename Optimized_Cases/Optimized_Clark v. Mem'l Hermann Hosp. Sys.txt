Background:
In January 1996, Charles Clark was diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure and underwent mitral valve replacement surgery. Over the subsequent two years, Clark experienced complications, including a valvular leak. In May 1998, Dr. Richard Alexander performed emergency surgery on Clark but failed to recover and died on May 14, 1998.

On December 30, 1999, Sharon Clark, as the executrix of Charles Clark's estate, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against nine healthcare providers, alleging medical negligence. The case focused on three main allegations: the failure to use a ventricular heart-assist device, the untimely performance of surgery to repair the valvular leak, and the non-use of pharmacological agents to lower Clark's pulmonary hypertension.

Sharon Clark designated Dr. James Bass, Jr., a thoracic surgeon, and Dr. Jean-Bernard Durand, a cardiologist, as expert witnesses to testify on liability and causation. However, the defendants challenged the qualifications of both experts. Dr. Bass had relinquished his privileges to perform cardiac surgery in 1991 due to insufficient surgical experience and had never performed a "re-do" mitral valve replacement or repair surgery, similar to the one in question. Dr. Durand was not a surgeon and testified that he would not be qualified to offer opinions about cardiovascular surgery. He also stated he would not opine about the standard of care for a cardiovascular surgeon or criticize the surgery.

During the expert witnesses' challenges, the court conducted a hearing and considered the witnessesâ€™ qualifications under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 and the repealed Medical Liability Act, section 14.01, which outlined the qualifications needed for expert witnesses in health care liability claims. As a result, the trial court excluded the expert testimonies related to the surgery day decisions, including the use of assist devices, the pharmacological strategies for lowering pulmonary hypertension, and the timing of Clark's surgery. Following the exclusion of the expert testimony, the trial court granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment, leading the plaintiff to appeal the decision.

Verdict:
The judgment will be affirmed because the appellant will be unable to meet her burden of proof regarding the two essential elements of breach of standard of care and proximate cause. Since expert testimony is crucial in establishing these elements in a medical malpractice case, and the appellant's designated experts, Drs. Bass and Durand, were found not qualified to testify on the standards of care and proximate cause relevant to the allegations, there will be no admissible expert testimony to support the appellant's claims.

The trial court's rulings to exclude the testimonies were made with reference to guiding rules and principles of Texas Rule of Evidence 702, the Medical Liability Act, and related case law. The expert witnesses will be ruled as lacking sufficient experience, training, or knowledge of the specific medical procedures and conditions at issue in the claim, and any opinion testimony they offered did not have a reliable scientific or medical foundation.

Additionally, the testimonies on crucial issues such as the use of a ventricular heart-assist device, pharmacological treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and the timeliness of Clark's surgery will be considered either irrelevant or not based on sufficient expertise. As expert testimony on these issues is necessary for the plaintiff's burden, and since the appellant failed to present qualified experts capable of providing legally sufficient evidence on these points, the appellees will prevail on their no-evidence summary judgment motions.

Therefore, the appellate court will overrule the appellant's points of error and uphold the trial court's granting of the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff failed to present evidence with respect to elements essential to her claim which would necessitate reversal of the lower court's decision.
