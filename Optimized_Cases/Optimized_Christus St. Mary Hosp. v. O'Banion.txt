Background: Richard Wynne O'Banion, Sr. ("O'Banion") was admitted to Christus St. Mary Hospital following a heart attack. O'Banion had a medical history that included coronary artery disease, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and heart surgery. O'Banion's initial condition post-admission seemed to be improving, but during his stay, he fell while a nursing assistant helped him from the bathroom. This fall resulted in a broken right cheekbone and brain injuries, as evidenced by a CT scan that showed a complex fracture in the facial area and several small intracranial hematomas, along with encephalomalacia from previous cerebrovascular attacks. O'Banion was discharged to a nursing home, where he died a few days later.

At the trial, appellees (O'Banion's wife and children) provided testimonies from four physicians: Drs. Udonta, Croft, Smith, and Meissner. The testimonies covered various aspects, including O'Banion's prognosis following the fall, complications from brain injuries potentially contributing to his death, and the impact of the fall on his treatment and therapy likely resulting in secondary complications like pneumonia, infections, blood clots, or decubitus ulcers. Despite improvements in his condition prior to the fall, medical experts testified that the fall changed O'Banion's clinical course and that O'Banion became prone to many complications due to being bedridden and the discontinuation of Coumadin. However, there was some contradiction in the evidence on whether the fall directly caused O'Banion's death or if his existing heart condition was the actual cause. Ultimately, expert testimony did not conclusively state that the fall was the direct cause of death or identify specific complications from the fall as the cause. The case then went to appeal on the basis that this testimony provided insufficient evidence to prove proximate cause.

Verdict: The appellant hospital is likely to have the judgment reversed and rendered that the appellees take nothing from the hospital based on the legal insufficiency of the evidence regarding proximate cause. To successfully uphold the jury's verdict, there needed to be legally sufficient evidence to demonstrate that O'Banion's death was a direct result of the fall, which required ruling out other potential causes. The plaintiff must prove that the negligent act or omission was a substantial factor in the harm and that without it, the harm would not have occurred. Expert testimonies did not establish this causation beyond the point of conjecture as they did not provide concrete evidence that the fall was directly responsible for O'Banion's death, only that his condition was negatively impacted following the fall. For instance, they indicated that while the fall may have altered O'Banion's prognosis and led to additional risks or complications like pneumonia or heart problems due to the altered treatment regime post-fall, no expert could rule out the possibility that O'Banion could have died from his preexisting heart condition regardless of the fall. 

Furthermore, testimonies referring to an increased mortality rate or potential contributions to the death were not precise enough to satisfy the legal requirement for proving proximate cause. Mortality rates and the loss of a chance of survival are not recognized as adequate evidence of proximate cause under Texas law. Given the other plausible causes of death not ruled out by the testimonies, such as heart failure or a cardiac event, and the inability of the experts to definitively link the fall to the death through an identified complication, it seems that the hospital's assertion regarding the legal insufficiency of evidence stands. Considering the standard that a preponderance of the evidence shows the negligent act was a substantial factor in the harm and without which the harm would not have occurred, the court is likely to find in favor of the appellant, Christus St. Mary Hospital. Consequently, the judgment in favor of the appellees will be reversed, and a judgment will be rendered that appellees take nothing from the hospital.
