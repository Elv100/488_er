Background:
Philip Benoit, the owner and manager of a tourist camp, was the defendant in a wrongful death case brought by the family of Robert L. Wilson, Jr. (consisting of widow Mrs. Garnitt Wilson, her two minor children, and Robert L. Wilson, Sr.), who died as a result of an explosion of gas in a tourist cabin at Benoit's camp on March 23, 1947. The deceased had checked into the camp, housed in Cabin No. 22, and was noticed to be intoxicated upon his return to the cabin after a brief departure. Eventually, an explosion occurred the following morning, leading to Wilson's death from injuries sustained.

The plaintiff's case alleged negligence by Benoit due to the maintenance of a natural gas heater connected via a flexible rubber and fabric hose, contrary to a Waco city ordinance prohibiting such connections. During the trial, the jury found that the use of this prohibited hose and Wilson's intoxicated state were both proximate causes of the explosion and his death. Based on these findings, the trial court rendered a judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing. The Court of Civil Appeals, however, reversed this judgment and found in favor of the Wilson family, holding that three intoxication special issues relating to Wilson's intoxicated condition should not have been submitted to the jury. Subsequently, the court also reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case for a new trial, on the basis that the intoxication issues were submitted on an erroneous theory. 

The case involved extensive testimonies concerning Wilson's actions before the explosion, the condition and placement of the gas heater hose, the specifics of the gas explosion, and investigations following the incident. There was also significant legal debate over whether the evidence presented justified the submission of several special issues to the jury, particularly those related to Wilson's intoxication and the act of disconnecting the rubber hose from the gas jet.

Verdict:
The judgments from the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals will be reversed, and the case will be remanded to the trial court for a new trial. The reasons for such a decision will be based on the conclusion that the special issues relative to the intoxication of the deceased, Robert L. Wilson, Jr., were submitted to the jury upon an incorrect legal theory.

The evidence indicates negligence per se due to the prohibited use of a flexible hose for the gas connection, as it contravenes a city ordinance. The jury will have reasonably inferred that the hose was a proximate cause of the explosion and Wilson's death, given the uncontroverted fact of the explosion and a sufficient presence of gas in the cabin to cause it. The jury is deemed to have rightfully considered all facts and circumstances when making its determination, and the role of the jury as the exclusive fact-finder will be respected.

However, the issues of intoxication submitted to the jury will be found not to have been justified since the evidence does not sufficiently support a finding that Wilson's intoxicated condition contributed to or was a proximate cause of the explosion. The only acts proven regarding Wilson are considered normal and cannot be established as negligent nor as contributory factors to the explosion.

Finally, justice will be said to demand a new trial based on the improper presentation of intoxication issues to the jury and the potential for facts that were not fully developed or presented due to the trial being conducted under a wrong legal theory. Moreover, the Court of Civil Appeals' decision to reverse and render, rather than remand for a new trial, will be said to be incorrect because a rendering of judgment would only be justified when the record unambiguously shows that the case tried under the correct theory would not have provided sufficient evidence for the plaintiffs to recover. Therefore, the need for a retrial will be deemed evident to ascertain the material facts and to ensure proper justice.
