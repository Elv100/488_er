Background:
On September 19, 1993, a 14-year-old named Steven Barker shot and killed Jackie Condren using .45 caliber bullets that had been purchased from AAA Pawn Shop, which was owned and operated by R.L. Bowman. Jackie Condren's wife, Johnell Condren, along with other family members, filed a lawsuit against R.L. Bowman, alleging negligence in the sale of the ammunition to a minor. The case saw various procedural developments. The claims by the Condren children were dismissed, leaving Johnell as the sole plaintiff, represented by Willie Holder as her next friend due to her mental incompetency. The trial court initially granted a summary judgment in favor of R.L. Bowman, leading to an appeal which was dismissed and remanded due to jurisdictional issues. Following this, an amended motion for summary judgment was filed by Bowman and subsequently granted on December 27, 1999, which led to the current appeal.

Holder argued four issues for consideration: 1) the application of res judicata, 2) Holder's standing to bring suit as Johnell's next friend, 3) whether the sale of .45 caliber ammunition to a child could constitute negligence or negligence per se, and 4) regarding the claims of negligence and the rule on no evidence motions in summary judgments. The appeal focused on whether the sale of the ammunition to a minor was a duty breached and whether that breach was a proximate cause of Jackie Condren's death. Holder cited federal law 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 922(b)(1), indicating it was illegal for a licensed dealer to sell or deliver certain types of ammunition to individuals under specified ages, arguing that this breach of law constituted negligence per se. However, even considering that, Holder needed to demonstrate the connection between the sale and the death as a proximate cause, with foreseeability as a key component.

Verdict:
When discussing the third and fourth points raised, which are pivotal in this case, the court will focus on the elements of a negligence cause of action which include duty, breach of duty, and damages proximately caused by the breach. While Holder points out that the federal statute creates a duty for sellers to not sell ammunition to minors, which was allegedly breached in this case, it will be determined that Holder failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that this breach was the proximate cause of Johnell's husband's death.

The court will emphasize that even if a breach of duty is found due to a violation of statute, it must also be shown that such a breach was a proximate cause of the injury sustained. This includes showing that the harm was foreseeable as a result of the negligence. Despite Holder's assertion that Johnell Condren falls within the class of individuals the statute aims to protect, and that the death was an outcome of a minor's actions that stemmed from the illegal sale of ammunition, there will be a requirement for specific evidence showing that the harm was foreseeable at the time of the sale. The criminal act of Barker, being a separate intervening action, will be deemed a superseding cause unless it was a foreseeable result of the negligence posed by Bowman's sale of ammunition to the minor.

The court will then address foreseeability and cause in fact as components of proximate cause, with a focus on whether there was any evidence indicating that Barker appeared incompetent, reckless, or dangerous when purchasing the ammunition, making his criminal conduct foreseeable to Bowman. Binder's argument that foreseeability is inherent in any sale of ammunition to minors will not be accepted, as that argument would effectively make a seller liable for any injuries resulting from such sales, transforming the seller into an insurer, which is not supported by Texas case law.

In conclusion, the court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Bowman, stating that Holder failed to present sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding proximate cause. The court will find that there were no facts shown from which Bowman should have been able to foresee Barker's subsequent criminal action, and thus, the actions that resulted in the death of Johnell's husband were not a foreseeable consequence of the sale of ammunition to the minor.
