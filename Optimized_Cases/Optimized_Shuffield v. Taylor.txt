{Background: The patient, Carlton Shuffield, as a minor represented by his father as next friend, filed a lawsuit against Dr. G. B. Taylor for damages related to alleged medical malpractice during a tonsillectomy. Shuffield claimed that Dr. Taylor not only performed a tonsillectomy but also removed his uvula, palate, and tonsillar pillars without parental consent, which he alleged resulted in loss of speech, hearing, and reduced mental capacity. Shuffield asserted Dr. Taylor was negligent in performing the surgery and in treating his adenoids and suppurating ears. Dr. Taylor denied these claims, contending that Shuffield's speech and hearing issues were congenital defects present from birth, and that any surgery performed did not cause, aggravate, or worsen his conditions.

The trial court found in favor of Shuffield, and the jury supported the claims of malpractice, resulting in damages awarded to Shuffield. However, the case was appealed, primarily over the admissibility of the parents' testimony. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the decision based on the contention that the parents' testimony about Shuffield's medical history was nonexpert and thus inadmissible. The appeal focused on whether nonexpert witnesses, such as parents, could testify regarding the apparent presence of disease or the change in their child's physical condition. The appeal also addressed issues around the expert testimony on hypothetical questions raised based on assumed facts and the refusal of certain special issues requested by the defendant.

The case involved complex considerations about expert versus nonexpert testimony, the framing of hypothetical questions, ultimate versus evidentiary issues, and the broader implications of a doctor's treatment actions, including preexisting conditions, parental consent, and the extent of medical procedures performed.}

{Verdict: The decision to exclude the parents' testimony would be reversed, given that such testimony is admissible due to their personal familiarities, such as frequent opportunities for observation, which enables them to speak on their sonâ€™s general health, strength, and physical changes, although they are not experts. The rejection of the parents' testimony overlooked established precedent that non-experts are competent to express opinions on certain physical conditions, like sickness or health, based on observations and facts.

Furthermore, it would be found that the hypothetical questions presented to medical experts were valid even if they only included part of the facts in evidence as they contained enough information for the experts to establish an opinion. It is permissible for either party to incorporate facts supported by evidence into their hypothetical questions, and it is not essential for hypothetical questions to include all facts under conflicting theories of the case.

Regarding the special issues requested by the defendant, the higher court will predict that they were rightly rejected as they were not ultimate issues but instead evidentiary and did not clearly differentiate between congenital and acquired conditions, nor did they clearly establish the timing of the disease in relation to the tonsillectomy. Only ultimate issues are required to be submitted to the jury.

With regards to the excluded testimony of Dr. Key, it will be upheld as not responsive, hearsay, a conclusion of the witness, and less preferable than the direct evidence provided by the record, according to the principle that the record itself is the best evidence and that the excluded response was a recollection of hearsay information that was already presented through the record admitted into evidence.

In summary, the higher court will conclude that the parents' testimony was improperly excluded, the hypothetical questions were sufficient for eliciting expert testimony, the requested special issues were rightly refused, and the exclusion of Dr. Key's testimonial was proper. Thus, the Court of Civil Appeals' judgment will be overruled, and the original trial court's decision in favor of Carlton Shuffield will be affirmed.}
