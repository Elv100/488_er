Background:
The appellants, a nightclub (Hellenic Investments, Inc.) and its owner (Konstantinos Venetoulias), are appealing a judgment from the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. The appellee, Tressie O'Brien, a nightclub patron, sued under the Texas Dram Shop Act, claiming she was injured in a car accident after becoming intoxicated at the appellants' nightclub. On October 27, 1990, O'Brien went to celebrate a birthday and consumed approximately half a beer before arriving at the Hullabaloo nightclub. There, after declining initial drink offers from Venetoulias due to concerns about driving home alone, she accepted upon Venetoulias’ assurance that she would be driven home by someone else. Over the course of the night, she was served about fifteen drinks, amounting to six to eight times her usual consumption, and became highly intoxicated. An off-duty police officer she encountered noted it was obvious she had been drinking and was probably legally intoxicated.

Despite the apparent intoxication, nightclub bartenders continued to serve her drinks until closing time. Upon leaving, Venetoulias had to support O'Brien to walk due to her intoxication. He then took her to her car, placed her inside, started the car for her, provided her money and license, and left her there. Subsequently, O'Brien had a one-car accident resulting in injuries. The trial court found that the nightclub and its owner were one-third negligent, awarding O'Brien actual and punitive damages totaling approximately $57,500. The appellants challenged the sufficiency of evidence to support the findings of negligence under the Dram Shop Act and proximate cause of the injuries. It was also argued that O'Brien's own actions contributed over fifty percent to her injuries and that she could have made safer choices such as waiting in the car or calling a cab from an adjacent grocery store.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the decision made by the trial court, holding the appellants one-third negligent. The verdict will support that it was foreseeable to Venetoulias that O’Brien could be injured after he left her intoxicated in her car with the keys in the ignition. By serving her excessive amounts of alcohol and facilitating her access to her vehicle while visibly intoxicated, the nightclub and its owner will be found to have violated their duty under the Texas Dram Shop Act.

The decision will emphasize that the nightclub provided alcohol to O'Brien when she was obviously intoxicated, presenting a clear danger to herself and others, and this served as a proximate cause of her damages. The appellants' argument that O'Brien's decision to attempt to drive was an unforeseeable, intervening cause will not be persuasive. Her attempt to drive in an intoxicated state, having been facilitated by the appellants’ actions, was a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of the nightclub and its owner, not an intervening cause that absolves the appellants of responsibility. Additionally, the court will state that the trial court's determination of responsibility is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence given to them.

Moreover, the court will find that Venetoulias had indeed undertaken a duty to ensure O'Brien was transported home safely and failed to fulfill this duty, leading to her injury. The appellants' remaining points of error regarding the duty owed by Venetoulias and the cause of O'Brien's injuries will be overruled. They are deemed either inadequately argued or unsupported by the evidence reviewed. Thus, the trial court's judgment will stand, holding that both Venetoulias and the nightclub were correctly held liable for the actual and punitive damages awarded to O'Brien.
