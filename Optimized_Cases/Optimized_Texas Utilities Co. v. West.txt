Background:
Mrs. O. F. West, as the surviving wife and legally appointed guardian of Howard Floyd and Maurine, the minor children of the deceased O. F. West, along with West's parents, H. T. West and Mattie, sued the Texas Utilities Company for damages due to O. F. West's death, which they alleged was caused by the company's negligence. O. F. West was electrocuted when attempting to put up an uninsulated copper wire from a windmill tower to his dwelling to serve as a radio aerial. The copper wire came into contact with the utility company's high-tension power line that presented the appearance of being insulated; however, the insulation was either insufficient from the start or had deteriorated due to age and exposure to weather. The plaintiffs argued that the company knew or should have known about the dangerous condition of the high-tension lines through ordinary diligence but failed to warn the deceased or remedy the defect, which they claimed was the proximate cause of O. F. West's death.

The trial court sustained the defendant's plea of limitations as to Mrs. O. F. West and the parents but held that this limitation did not apply to the minor children. A jury found that the high-tension wires were not sufficiently insulated, that the company failed to warn the deceased of the danger, and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of O. F. West. As a result, the trial court awarded damages to the children of O. F. West, prompting the utility company to appeal. The company contended that Mrs. West's guardianship established over two years before the lawsuit barred the claim under the statutes of limitation, and argued that the trial court erred by not ruling as a matter of law that the company was free from actionable negligence and that the deceased was contributorily negligent.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial. The appellate court will hold that while the trial court correctly determined the children's claims were not barred by a limitations period due to their minority status, it was incorrect for the trial court to have effectively ruled as a matter of law that there was no actionable negligence on the part of the utility company, or that O. F. West was guilty of contributory negligence. The appellate court will find that the jury's determination of negligence, duty of care, and foreseeability of injury due to the inadequately insulated power lines must be assessed by the facts presented, which include community customs regarding radio aerial installation, Mr. West's status as a property occupant (rather than a trespasser or licensee), the nature of electricity as a dangerous agency, and the evidence regarding the appearance and actual condition of the insulation. The conflicting jury findings on foreseeability will necessitate a new trial to resolve the inconsistency. The appellate court will also find fault with the main charge given to the jury as it incorrectly assumed the existence of negligence, and some of the issues were duplicative or potentially confusing regarding the burden of proof. The court will emphasize that Texas Utilities Company had a duty to use due care in maintaining its power lines, to remedy known defects, to anticipate and prevent injuries, and that the degree of care required was proportional to the danger posed by the power lines, taking into consideration their location and the likelihood of injury. The appellate court will conclude that these considerations were not properly adjudicated during the initial trial and that further proceedings are necessary to correctly apply the legal principles to the facts of the case.
