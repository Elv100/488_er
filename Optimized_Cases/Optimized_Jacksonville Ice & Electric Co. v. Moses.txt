Background:
The decedent, S. H. Moses, was killed by coming in contact with an electrical wire of the defendant ice and electric company while traveling at night, in wet conditions, in a bus after a rainstorm. When the bus reached a point on Kickapoo street, one of the horses pulling the bus fell, and the bus driver instructed the decedent to remain inside while he sought assistance. Upon the driver's return, he found the horses gone, an electrical wire in the street, and the decedent's body nearby, evidently killed by the wire's electric shock.

The company had constructed its power lines over a public road, causing the danger. The widow and children of the decedent filed a wrongful death action. The plaintiffs charged the defendant with several acts of negligence, including allowing wires to come into contact with tree limbs, permitting a broken wire to remain in the street, failing to properly insulate its wires, and failing to have suitable appliances to detect when a wire was grounded or down, or failing to inspect such appliances if they did exist. The defense argued that the wire was broken due to lightning during a storm, and the decedent was contributively negligent because he disobeyed the bus driver's instruction to stay inside the bus and came in contact with the fallen wire. The trial court left it to the jury to assess whether the company had performed its duty of care and whether there was contributory negligence by the decedent, which the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs with an award of $10,000.

Verdict:
The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is affirmed. The company had an obligation to exercise care that was proportionate to the danger its operations posed. This included a duty to employ precautions necessary and prudent to guard against the risk of injury for those using the highway near its electrical wires. The legal principles pertaining to the company's duty and the jury's role in assessing adherence to that standard are typically correct. By placing its electricity wires in an environment where they could interfere with public safety, the company needed to conform to a high standard, and it was proper to have the jury determine whether that standard had been met.

Regarding contributory negligence, such negligence is not to be presumed; it must be demonstrated with evidence. In this case, the evidence did not raise an issue of contributory negligence by the decedent. His actions in exiting the bus under unclear circumstances, potentially for his own safety, did not constitute negligence, and his contact with the wire seemed accidental.

The refusal of the court to give special charges requested by the defendant on contributory negligence and inspection duties is justified because either the evidence did not support these charges or they reiterated points already covered in the main charge.

If the presence of the company's wires over the public highway was unauthorized, as indicated by the testimony that the street was outside the corporate limits of the town of Jacksonville and no authority had been granted for the wires, then the defendant was maintaining a nuisance and would be responsible for resulting injuries from such obstruction. Thus, even if the company's wire broke due to lighting—a natural phenomenon—it would be liable for the consequences of the dangerous condition it created by stringing wires across a public highway without proper authority.

The company's use of an appliance within its plant to indicate downed or grounded wires shifted no responsibility from the corporation itself in ensuring timely inspection and response to wire conditions. Woodward, the employee in charge who failed to inspect, was considered the company's agent in fulfilling this duty. Therefore, any failure on his part was effectively a failure of the company itself to perform its non-delegable duties.

In affirming the lower court’s judgment, the higher court reiterates that the company had a non-delegable duty to maintain its wires and take appropriate actions to ensure public safety. Negligence on part of its employees in performing these duties is imputed to the company, and it cannot escape liability for the wrongful acts that caused the decedent's death.
