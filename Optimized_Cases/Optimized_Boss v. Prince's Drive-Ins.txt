Background:
The plaintiff, a customer of the defendant restaurant, was injured after intervening in an altercation involving a third party, referred to as Yosemite, on the restaurant's premises. Before the plaintiff's arrival, the manager of the restaurant was aware of a previous fight between Yosemite and two other men, but did not call the police. The plaintiff witnessed signs of a previous altercation upon driving into the parking lot but moved his car away to order food. Shortly thereafter, Yosemite was confronted by the same two men demanding repayment of a gambling debt. The plaintiff intervened in an attempt to calm the situation, but was assaulted by one of the men named Ainsworth. The manager was notified of the fight by a waitress and called the police, who arrived shortly after the altercation.

The jury found the manager's failure to call the police before the plaintiff was struck constituted negligence and proximate cause of the injuries. Moreover, they determined the plaintiff acted as a reasonably prudent man in intervening. Despite these findings, the lower court entered judgment for the defendant, prompting the plaintiff to appeal on the basis that his actions were motivated by humanitarian impulses and the jury found he acted prudently. The plaintiff contended that the rescue doctrine should apply, granting an exception to the non-liability rule. It was further stipulated that the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposed himself to danger, but the contention was that this did not preclude his recovery due to his intentions to assist.

Evidence showed the manager was aware of the initial fight prior to the plaintiff's arrival but considered it to have stopped. The manager intended to call the police about an unrelated issue when informed of the altercation near the plaintiff's car. The injured plaintiff arrived on the scene between 10:30 and 10:45 PM, and the assault took place within 15 minutes of arrival, prior to the 11:00 PM call to the police by the manager.

Yosemite was not a customer of the restaurant but was using the parking lot as a meeting point to continue travel with a friend. He occupied the status of a licensee on the premises, to whom the restaurant owed no duty to prevent third-party assaults.

Verdict:
The appellate court will likely affirm the judgment in favor of the defendant restaurant, reasoning that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's injuries resulted from a known and appreciated danger, which he voluntarily and deliberately exposed himself to as a result of an intelligent choice, and lawfully there is no exception that justifies his voluntary exposure, invoking the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria. The plaintiff's humanitarian motivation to assist does not impart responsibility upon the defendant for not preventing the assault.

Additionally, the appellate court will conclude that the plaintiff's intervention was the direct and proximate cause of his injuries rather than the defendant's delay in contacting law enforcement. The plaintiff, by intervening, expressly acknowledged the risk of becoming involved in the conflict and assumed the role of mediator, which was likely to incite the participants to violence against him. The implication is that without the plaintiff's intervention, the injury would not have occurred, as evidenced by other bystanders who did not intervene or suffer harm. The court will uphold that the rescue doctrine is not applicable because the hazardous situation of Yosemite did not arise from a breach of duty the defendant owed to him, given his status as a licensee. The absence of causation between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injuries will be deemed sufficient to bar recovery for the plaintiff. Therefore, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment for the defendant.
