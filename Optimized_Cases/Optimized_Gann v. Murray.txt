Background:
The plaintiffs, Sam Gann and others, through their guardian J.B. Dismuke, initiated a mandamus proceeding against the Honorable W.O. Murray and the justices of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District, seated in San Antonio, Texas. The proceeding sought to compel the Court of Civil Appeals to certify questions of law regarding venue to the Supreme Court, growing out of a suit for damages where the question of venue was deemed material. This case arose from an incident where the plaintiffs' car collided with the defendants' truck parked beside a highway at night. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to place flares at the mandatory distance from the parked truck as required by Tex. Penal Code art. 827a, § 9-a. Another offense was also alleged, but it was not discussed in detail.

The trial court concluded that the injuries were not proximately caused by the alleged offenses and sustained the defendants' pleas of privilege to change the venue to the defendants' home county. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed this decision, which the plaintiffs then contested, arguing that for the purposes of venue under § 9 of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, the injury did not have to be proximately caused by the crime. The plaintiffs contended that it was sufficient for them to prove that the crime occurred in the county where the suit was pending. In defense of their argument, the plaintiffs cited a conflict between the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals and the previous case Hurley v. Reynolds, which held that proving proximate cause was not necessary to retain the venue in the county of the crime.

The Court of Civil Appeals assumed for the purposes of its opinion that an offense under a valid statute was alleged and proved, without considering whether the penal code in question was repealed or if a valid offense was indeed alleged and proved in the case at bar. Furthermore, the trial court found, based on proof, that flares were placed 80 feet from the parked truck (as opposed to the 150 feet required) and could be seen in time to avoid the collision, leading to the finding that the injuries were not proximately caused by this offense.

Verdict:
The court will likely render a verdict that aligns with the plaintiffs’ argued position, based on an established legal precedent that for venue purposes under § 9, where a suit is based on a crime, it isn’t necessary to prove that injuries were proximately caused by that crime. Instead, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the crime was in fact committed and that it occurred in the county where the suit was pending. The verdict will be underpinned by the concept that the connection between the injury suffered and the crime committed is to be determined as a matter of law from the pleadings, rather than facts requiring proof in a venue hearing. This determination is crucial because it impacts whether the plaintiffs’ suit is legally "based upon" the crime in question for the purposes of venue. 

The court will clarify that the defendants are not protected against unfounded factual allegations that the crime was the proximate cause of the injury, as the pleas of privilege are not intended to shield defendants from baseless lawsuits. The decision will emphasize that the plaintiffs are required to prove only the commission and location of the alleged crime according to the established standards for venue questions, not the entire cause of action or the full extent of the claimed damages. Consequently, the court will likely direct the Court of Civil Appeals to conform its ruling and decision to the principles elucidated, answering the certified question in the negative and negating the need for proving proximate cause solely for the determination of venue within the context of § 9.
