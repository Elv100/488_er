Background:
The case involves a dental malpractice lawsuit under the Texas Medical Liability Act, where appellants Michael and Lisa Ann Bell sued appellees Matthew Markham, Jeffry Lynch, and The McKinney Dentist ("TMD") for alleged dental negligence. The Bells first expert report, provided by Robbie Henwood, D.D.S., was judged insufficient, leading to remand of the case to permit the Bells to serve amended and additional expert reports. On June 8, 2018, the Bells submitted Henwood's amended expert report and provided an additional report by Lane R. Miller, M.D. After the trial court granted a 30-day extension to cure the reports, the appellees pursued dismissal on the grounds that the reports were untimely served, experts were unqualified, and opinions on the standard of care, breaches, and causation were deficient. The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, prompting the present appeal.

The Bells challenged the dismissal on five main grounds: (1) that Henwood's and Miller's expert reports were timely served on remand; (2) that Robbie Henwood was qualified to offer expert opinions on causation; (3) that Henwood's amended expert report met statutory requirements; (4) that Lane R. Miller was qualified to offer expert opinions regarding causation; and (5) that Miller's expert report adequately addressed causation.

Verdict:
In the judgment to be reversed and the case remanded, the analysis will likely reveal that the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant's objections regarding the timeliness and qualifications of the experts and the sufficiency of the expert reports. It will be determined that Henwood, being a licensed dentist with relevant training in periodontal disease and expertise in cardiovascular physiology, is indeed qualified to offer expert opinions on the causal relationship between dental care and cardiac conditions. Henwood's report, which was detailed in establishing causation between oral infections and cardiovascular disease, complied with statutory requirements by providing a narrative that explained how untreated periodontal infections could spread and lead to serious conditions such as endocarditis.

Moreover, as a physician, Miller's cardiological expertise was appropriate for discussing causation in a lawsuit against a dentist, especially when it pertains to complications such as endocarditis stemming from oral infections. The appellate court will conclude that the trial court should not have sustained the objections to Miller's report based on his lack of qualifications to render opinions on dental standards of care, as he did not offer such opinions.

Furthermore, it will be concluded that the expert's report need not rule out all possible conditions or sources of infection to be deemed adequate. The reports in question provided enough information to inform the defendants of the conduct in question and to establish the merit of the claims, fulfilling the purpose of the statutory requirement. It will be reasoned that the dismissal at this early stage was inappropriate since the reports represented a good-faith effort to conform to the statutory requirements. The trial court will be found to have abused its discretion by accepting the argument that absolute certainty was necessary from the expert reports at this stage. As a result, the trial court's order granting the motions to dismiss will be overturned and the case will be sent back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.
