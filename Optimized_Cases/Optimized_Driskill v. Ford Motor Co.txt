Background:
James and Joyce Driskill's 1993 Lincoln Town Car caught fire in 2003 while parked in their garage, resulting in the destruction of their home and personal belongings. Investigations determined that the fire originated in the left rear area of the car's engine compartment. The Driskills filed a products liability lawsuit in Van Zandt County, Texas, against Ford Motor Company and Sensata Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as Texas Instruments, Inc.), who were involved in the creation of the car. The crux of the Driskills' claims centered around the allegation that a defect in the speed control deactivation switch (SCDS) was responsible for causing the fire.

During the legal proceedings, the trial court excluded in part the testimony of the Driskills' expert witness concerning the causation of the fire, although the testimony about the location of the fire's origin remained. The expert witness attested that the fire had begun in the indicated area of the engine compartment. Despite this, the court granted summary judgments in favor of Ford and Sensata after concluding that the Driskills failed to bridge the analytical gap between the fire's origin and the defective SCDS as the cause-in-fact.

It was noted that before the fire, the car's cruise control had become inoperative, and the SCDS itself was found "burned and melted beyond recognition." However, no definitive link was established by expert testimony that directly tied the malfunctioning SCDS to the ignition of the fire. Ford and Sensata filed no-evidence motions for summary judgment, claiming there was no evidence of the necessary proximate cause to support the Driskills' claims. Furthermore, the Driskills did not preserve their argument regarding the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur for appellate review, having not raised the issue in their response to the motions for summary judgment.

Verdict:
The Appeals Court will uphold the decision of the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of Ford and Sensata due to multiple reasons. Firstly, Ford’s and Sensata’s motions for summary judgment will be found to comply with Rule 166a(i) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule relates to no-evidence summary judgments, and the court will likely conclude that while the manufacturers did not list every element of the causes of action, they did pinpoint the absence of evidence regarding cause-in-fact, a crucial element required to be proven by the Driskills. 

Secondly, the absence of evidence of proximate cause will be a determining factor. Due to the complexity of establishing causation in a products liability action centered around sophisticated products—where the issues are beyond the general knowledge of laypersons—expert testimony was critical. The Appeals Court will find that the Driskills failed to provide more than a mere suspicion that the SCDS was the cause-in-fact of the fire which would necessitate bridging the analytical gap with more substantial evidence provided by a qualified expert, as per pertinent Texas law and precedents such as Tamez and Nissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong.

Lastly, the Appeals Court will not consider the res ipsa loquitur argument as it was not preserved for appeal. The Driskills' failure to raise this issue in their initial response to the summary judgment motions will be viewed as a forfeiture of the right to rely on this doctrine on appeal.

Based on the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed by the Appeals Court, thereby dismissing the Driskills' suit against the manufacturers due to insufficient proof of proximate causation and procedurally unpreserved arguments.
