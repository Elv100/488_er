Background:
The appellant, Excel Corporation (Excel), a meatpacking plant in Friona, Texas, appealed a judgment in favor of the appellee, Jimmy Apodaca, regarding his injuries sustained during the course of his employment. Apodaca worked at Excel for 17 years, with the last three years spent operating a cryovac 8300 machine which required repetitive motions. He reported pain in his hand, neck, and lower back, and completed an employee statement of injury on April 29, 1995. While the costs for his carpal tunnel injury were initially covered by Excel, they ceased payment after one physician reported the injury resolved in August 1995. The costs for his other injuries were not covered by Excel.

Apodaca filed a lawsuit alleging that his cumulative trauma injuries resulted from Excel's negligence in failing to provide a safe workplace. The jury found Excel negligent and awarded actual damages of $536,472. The trial court affirmed the jury's verdict. Excel's appeal raised several issues, including an objection to not striking a prospective juror for bias, challenging the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, and rulings on jury instructions regarding sole proximate cause, new and independent cause, separate negligence questions for multiple injuries, and comments on the effect of the jury's answers. Excel also contested the award of over three years of prejudgment interest due to alleged delay by Apodaca in filing the trial.

During the trial, evidence was presented that the cryovac machine operation involved risk factors associated with cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs), such as repetitive motion and excessive production line speedsâ€”with workers discouraged from slowing or stopping the line. Despite recommendations from OSHA and the presence of a high injury rate among machine operators, Excel did not enact suggested ergonomic changes. Various physicians offered conflicting testimonies on whether Apodaca's injuries were work-related, but overall, the jury could have inferred that the work environment was the cause of the injuries.

Verdict:
The appellate court's verdict was to affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of Apodaca. The decision found no reversible error with the trial court's rulings, including the juror challenge, as bias was not conclusively demonstrated. The causation evidence, while not strong, allowed the jury to reasonably infer that Apodaca's work environment and Excel's negligence were factors in his injuries. 

The appellate court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its decisions on jury instructions and did not err in refusing to submit additional instructions that merely duplicated questions already presented. Regarding damages, there was no abuse of discretion since the jury was tasked to award damages only for injuries found to be caused by Excel's negligence. The appellate court held that the trial court's charge did not inappropriately comment on the effect of the jury's answers, and the award of prejudgment interest was not an abuse of discretion, even considering the potential delay in filing the lawsuit.

In conclusion, the appellate court overruled all of Excel's issues since the trial court's actions were found not to have likely caused the rendition of an improper judgment. The judgment in favor of Apodaca was affirmed, with one justice dissenting on the basis that evidence of causation was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding.
