Background: 
Daniella Bustamante was born prematurely at Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso on May 19, 2005. She suffered from several medical problems related to her premature birth and was admitted to Del Sol's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where she was under the care of Dr. Enrique N. Ponte Jr., a neuroneonatologist, and Dr. Jorge Fabio Llamas-Soforo, an ophthalmologist. Ponte, who was concerned about Daniella developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), contacted Llamas for examination. Llamas examined Daniella on July 4, 2005, and saw no signs of ROP; he recommended a follow-up in four weeks. On August 1, Daniella was found to have developed ROP, and surgery was performed on August 4. Despite this, Daniella's right retina became detached, leading to blindness in the right eye and significant impairment in her left eye.

Appellees, acting as next friends of Daniella, sued Ponte, Llamas, and their employers for medical malpractice, alleging negligence that caused Daniella's vision impairment. They claimed the four-week delay between ROP examinations and a three-day delay in surgical treatment post-diagnosis, as well as an inadequately performed laser surgery, violated the standard of care and proximately caused Daniella’s injuries. Appellees relied on the expert testimony of Dr. William Good, a pediatric ophthalmologist, and Dr. Dale Phelps, a neonatologist. The jury found Ponte, Llamas, and the Del Sol Medical Center negligent. Dr. Good and Dr. Phelps testified that the injuries were preventable and that earlier treatment would have likely resulted in a sighted life for Daniella.

Verdict:
The verdict in the case was reversed with the court rendering judgment that the appellees take nothing. In predicting the reasoning for this verdict, the key focus of the appellate court was the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding proximate cause. Specifically, the court analyzed the cause in fact, which requires proof that the negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries and that the harm would not have occurred but for the negligent act. The expert testimony was found to be legally insufficient to support a causation finding; it was deemed too conclusory and speculative as it did not establish but-for causation backed by a sufficient factual basis.

The court found that the testimony from the appellees’ experts did not establish that the delay in examinations and the manner of the surgery were more likely than not the but-for cause of Daniella’s injuries. The testimony that earlier examinations would have provided an opportunity for treatment that "would have improved the chance of a good visual outcome" and that the delay in surgery "incrementally increased the chances of a bad outcome," was insufficient for establishing but-for causation. The court required the plaintiff's experts to provide a basis for their opinions that linked the defendants’ specific acts of negligence to the injuries sustained, rather than general assertions or statistical probabilities.

Additionally, the court considered the ETROP study results, which showed that early treatment for ROP led to better outcomes, but did not provide specific evidence that earlier treatment would have prevented Daniella's particular injuries. The study’s statistical probability was not by itself considered legally sufficient to establish causation without a factual demonstration that Daniella's case was substantially similar to those in the study. The court concluded that the expert testimony lacked a factual foundation, and as such, their causation opinions were conclusory and could not be considered probative evidence of causation.

In summary, the court rejected the notion that the appellees had proven that it was more likely than not that the negligence by Ponte and Llamas proximately caused Daniella's vision loss. The court called for more specific evidence directly connecting the negligent acts to the injuries rather than reliance on statistical probabilities or the assertion that the negligence contributed in some way to the injuries. Thus, due to the lack of non-conclusory, legally sufficient evidence of causation, the court decided in favor of the appellants, reversing the judgment of the trial court.
