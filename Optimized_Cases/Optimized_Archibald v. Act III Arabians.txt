Background:
The petitioner, horse owner John Archibald, placed his Arabian mare in the training program offered by the respondent, Act III Arabians. The mare was to be trained in an English pleasure riding style, but proved difficult to manage, often bucking when commanded to trot. During a particularly rigorous training session aimed at breaking the mare's bucking habit, one of the respondent's trainers used a riding crop extensively, causing welts on the mare. This led to abrasions and swelling, which were treated by a veterinarian. However, the mare's condition worsened as her skin began to slough off, leading to the development of founder, a disease impairing blood circulation to the hoof. Ultimately, the mare's condition became so severe that she had to be destroyed.

Archibald sued Act III Arabians, claiming damages as a result of the mare's death, based on allegations of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). The jury found that Act III Arabians did not train the mare in a good and workmanlike manner, contributing to the mare's death and assessing her fair market value at $75,000. However, the trial court rendered a judgment against Archibald, ruling that no implied warranties exist for services under Texas law. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, taking the view that horse training did not fall under the scope of implied warranties for services related to the repair or modification of existing tangible goods or property.

Verdict:
The case revolves around determining whether horse training services fall under the scope of an implied warranty of good and workmanlike performance. An implied warranty of this nature applies to services that involve the repair or modification of existing tangible goods or property. As a horse is defined as "existing tangible goods" and horse training is an activity that modifies a horse's demeanor, skills, intrinsic ability to perform, obey commands, and its market value, the court will likely find that horse training is a service that should be implicitly warranted to be of good and workmanlike performance.

Given the outcome of the previous court rulings and focusing on the Texas Supreme Court precedent in Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, the court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for consideration of further points of error that have not yet been addressed. Given that the jury found the training was not conducted in a good and workmanlike manner and contributed to the mare's death, the court will acknowledge this service rendered by the respondent fell under the scope of an implied warranty, which was breached. Therefore, the petitioner will be entitled to recover under the grounds of negligence, gross negligence, and violations of the DTPA, considering the improper training amounted to a modification of the mare's intrinsic value as an existing tangible good.
