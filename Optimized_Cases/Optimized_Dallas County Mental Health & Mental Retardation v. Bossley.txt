Background:
Defendant government mental health institute, Dallas County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center (Dallas County MHMR), and its staff were involved in a wrongful death suit brought by plaintiff parents following the death of their son, Roger Bossley. Bossley had been involuntarily committed to Parkland Memorial Hospital after a suicide attempt and later transferred to Hillside Center, a facility operated by Dallas County MHMR.

While Bossley showed signs of initial recovery, an incident involving a rehabilitation counselor left him despondent, expressing a desire to obtain a gun for the purpose of suicide upon his release. This concern was reported to treating physicians and noted as a definite risk. A decision was made to transfer Bossley to Parkland Memorial Hospital for further evaluation in a more restrictive environment. Despite measures such as locking the main door, an inner self-locking glass door remained open. As staff technician Angela Jones was leaving for lunch, she inadvertently allowed Bossley the chance to push her aside and escape the facility due to the unlocked doors. Bossley was then pursued by Hillside staff and police, eventually running into highway traffic and being killed by a truck.

The plaintiffs, Roger's parents Albert and Elaine Bossley, claimed that their son's death was directly linked to the staff's failure to secure the environment properly, particularly with regards to the unlocked doors. They argued that the wrongful death was "proximately caused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property," invoking the Texas Tort Claims Act, which contains provisions for waiving governmental immunity for property-related injuries or death.

The trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor of the defendants, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas. 

Verdict:
The court will reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas and render a judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing. The reasoning for this outcome will center on the interpretation of the Tort Claims Act, which waives governmental immunity not in a broad sense but in limited situations where the government would be held liable as if it were a private person. It will be understood that while the unlocked doors played a role in the sequence of events that led to Roger's death, the doors themselves cannot be regarded as the proximate cause of his suicide. Rather, they merely provided the condition that made the escape possible. The plaintiffâ€™s core complaint will be interpreted as being against the failure of the staff to restrain Bossley knowing his condition, which is not a grounds for waiver of immunity under the Act.

The scope of the decision will also include immunity for individual staff members under Section 101.106 of the Act, as the claim against these individuals involves the same subject matter as the claim against the governmental unit, and the unit's immunity extends to the employees. The court will dismiss the plaintiff's arguments against this point by establishing that all individual defendants are entitled to the same immunity, regardless of the specific actions of each individual. Finally, it will be noted that the precedential cases cited by the plaintiffs, Lowe v. Texas Tech University and Robinson v. Central Texas MHMR Center, are limited to instances where provided property lacked integral safety components leading to injury, not applicable in this case as Hillside, did not lack an integral safety component due to being unlocked in compliance with its policy.
