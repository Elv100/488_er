Background:
Shelly Fennern, a 47-year-old woman, underwent elective colon resection surgery on March 28, 2007, at Shannon Medical Center in San Angelo, Texas. She experienced an anastomotic leak from the surgery. A CT scan performed on April 9 revealed the leak, and Fennern subsequently had a second surgery to correct the issue. Post-operatively, Fennern developed increasing tachycardia and hypoxemia and reported shortness of breath. Although initially improving and being removed from the ventilator on April 20, Fennern became unresponsive on April 23, was resuscitated, but eventually died later that morning after her family requested the removal of vasopressor agents. 

Jeffrey Fennern and Farah Fennern, the appellants, filed a medical negligence suit against Dr. William Whitehead, the appellee and treating physician, alleging that Whitehead's failure to diagnose the anastomotic leak until April 9 represented a breach of the applicable standard of care, and that this delay was a proximate cause of Fennern's death. They relied on the testimony of Dr. Brian Camazine, an expert witness, who opined that a delay in diagnosis led to conditions like peritonitis, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which ultimately resulted in Fennern's death due to either pulmonary embolus or cardiac arrhythmia.

The district court granted Whitehead's motion to exclude Dr. Camazine's testimony, finding it to be speculative and unreliable. Consequently, the court also granted Whitehead's no-evidence motion for summary judgment, as a result of which a take-nothing judgment was entered against the appellants. The appellants challenged the exclusion of the expert testimony on appeal, contending that Dr. Camazine's opinions were reliable and based on his extensive experience, published medical literature, and general medical knowledge.

Whitehead's motion to exclude was partly based on the argument that Dr. Camazine's testimony lacked a reliable foundation and was grounded in speculation, not scientific evidence. During proceedings, Dr. Camazine acknowledged he had not reviewed medical literature to support his opinions specifically and that the articles he later provided did not support the critical delay period (from day 8 to day 12 after the initial surgery) he argued was a substantial factor in Fennern's death.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the judgment of the district court. The reasoning will focus on the reliability standards for expert witness testimony, consistent with the precedents set by cases such as Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. The court will rule that the expert testimony provided by Dr. Camazine was rightly excluded because it was not sufficiently grounded in scientific methods and procedures. Dr. Camazine's opinion was deemed to lack a proper basis as he had not conducted a thorough literature review to underpin his conclusions, and the medical articles presented did not specifically support the significance of the four-day delay in the diagnosis of Fennern's condition, nor did they establish a direct link between the delay and her death.

Furthermore, they will determine there is an analytical gap between the data available and the opinion proffered by Dr. Camazine. His assertions about the potential causes of Fennern's death were speculative, as they were based on probability and possible increased risk, rather than a direct causal link established with reasonable medical certainty. Consequently, Whitehead's actions or omissions cannot be considered a substantial factor in Fennern's death, insufficient to meet the legal standard for proximate cause required to demonstrate medical negligence. This conclusion leads the court to affirm the district court's grant of no-evidence motion for summary judgment in Whitehead's favor since, without the expert testimony, the appellants lacked evidence to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence and Fennern's death. The appellate court will base its affirmation on the need for expert opinions to be more than mere speculation and to demonstrate a reliable, causal connection to the alleged harm based on reasonable medical probability.
