Background:
Zachary Anam was detained by employees of Macy's department store for alleged shoplifting and arrested by Officer Iven Wall; he was handcuffed, placed in a patrol car, and had his seatbelt fastened. Officer Wall did not find the handgun Zachary had hidden on his person. During the drive to police headquarters, Zachary unbuckled his seatbelt, revealing the gun. Wall asked Zachary if he had anything else illegal, and informed him he would be searched at the jail which might lead to additional charges. Zachary disclosed he was feeling suicidal and had a loaded gun to his head. Wall stopped the car, exited, called for assistance, and warned others nearby. Minutes later, Zachary committed suicide by shooting himself.

The Anams sued the City of Austin under the Texas Tort Claims Act, contending Officer Wall's negligence in failing to refasten Zachary's seatbelt allowed him to access his gun and that the seatbelt's condition contributed to the death. They argued the Act waived the City's governmental immunity because the death arose from the use of a motor-driven vehicle or from a condition or use of tangible personal property.

The City filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting the claims do not fall under the Act's waivers of immunity. The trial court denied the City's plea. The City appealed, and the case was reconsidered en banc.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's decision and render judgment dismissing the Anams' claims against the City. The reasoning will hinge on the concept of proximate cause under the Tort Claims Act. The Anams will not have demonstrated the requisite foreseeability that failing to fasten a seatbelt in a police vehicle would lead to suicide by gunshot, nor that Wall's action in not refastening the seatbelt was a substantial factor in causing the injury that would not have occurred otherwise. Although seatbelt use is intended to prevent harm in the event of a collision or sudden stop, the appellate court will determine that the general danger of suicide in these circumstances should not have been foreseeable to an officer of ordinary intelligence.

The court will find that the Anams' claims do not address a wrongful act, omission, or condition or use of tangible property as defined under section 101.021 of the Act that proximately caused Zachary's death. Instead, the real substance of their claim will be seen to pertain to Wall's failure to detect and remove Zachary's gun before placing him in the patrol car, a scenario where the Act does not waive immunity.

Thus, the court will conclude that the claim cannot trigger the Act's narrow waiver of immunity, and the City's governmental immunity will remain intact. The appellate court's verdict will effectively hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Anams under the Texas Tort Claims Act.
