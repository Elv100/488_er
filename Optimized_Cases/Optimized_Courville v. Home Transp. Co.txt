Background:
The incident at the core of this case took place around 5:00 a.m. on May 24, 1969, on Interstate Highway 10 in Texas. The situation began when an automobile operated by someone named Benoit collided with the rear end of a truck belonging to Home Transportation Company. After the collision, the truck did not stop and left the Benoit automobile blocking the inside lane of the highway. Subsequently, the victim, Guillory, arrived as a passenger in a separate vehicle. Guillory and the driver of the third vehicle stopped to check on the Benoit automobile. During this examination, an automobile driven by Croker struck and killed Guillory.

During the trial, the jury determined that the driver of the Home Transportation Company truck was negligent for leaving the scene, failing to place fusees (safety flares or similar warning devices), and failing to stop and render aid, with these acts of negligence contributing to Guillory's death. The jury did not find any negligence on Croker's part or any contributory negligence from Guillory. Benoit, the driver of the automobile that initially collided with the truck, was also found to be driving under the influence, which the jury acknowledged as negligent and a proximate cause of the collision between the Croker automobile and Guillory. However, there was no direct evidence showing Benoit's intoxication caused the original collision or the subsequent accident involving Guillory.

The trial court disregarded the jury's findings and entered judgment non obstante veredicto (notwithstanding the verdict), in favor of the defendant trucking company. The plaintiff, the surviving spouse, sought review of that decision, challenging the judgment entered in favor of the Benoit Estate and Home Transportation Company.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment non obstante veredicto for the defendant trucking company because the evidence does not establish that the trucking company created a dangerous condition through negligence. In their reasoning, the court will likely distinguish between a moral obligation and a legal duty to render assistance or warn of potential dangers. Despite the jury's finding of negligence against the trucking company for its actions after the initial collision, the court will conclude that the company did not have a legal duty to Guillory because the incident resulted from the lawful and non-negligent use of the highway by the trucking company.

The court's application of legal precedent will consider whether the defendant trucking company "created a dangerous condition," as this is a pivotal factor in determining legal duty. Drawing from precedents such as Buchanan v. Rose and Coleman v. Hudson Gas and Oil Corporation, the court will determine that creating a dangerous condition requires affirmative action such as making an excavation or obstructing the roadway, which was not demonstrated by the plaintiff in this case. As there was no direct evidence that the Home Transportation Company's driver acted negligently to cause the collision that led to Guillory's death, the court will affirm that there was no legal duty violated by the defendant and, therefore, no basis for liability. 

Furthermore, the court will not recognize intoxication as an "ultimate issue" in itself, but rather as a potential act of negligence that must be proven to be a "cause in fact" of the incident, which was not done in this case. The decision will uphold the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant trucking company, emphasizing the absence of legal duty and the failure of the plaintiff to prove the existence and violation of such a duty.
