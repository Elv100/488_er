Background:
Clodus B. Wright, the appellant insured, was covered under a policy by The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, the appellee insurer, which agreed to pay him $5,000.00 for the loss of a foot "solely as a result of accidental bodily injury sustained or disease contracted while this policy is in force." While the policy was active, Wright's leg had to be amputated due to gangrene, which developed as a result of a gunshot wound he incurred during a robbery at the Brook Hollow Country Club. Wright argued that he was entitled to the policy benefits, as his leg's amputation—the loss of his foot—was solely due to the gangrene, a disease contracted while the policy was in effect. Wright also contended that the policy's language did not preclude coverage for loss due to disease contracted from an injury obtained during a robbery.

The insurance company maintained that Wright should have reasonably expected to be shot and injured given his involvement in the robbery, consequently deeming the injury not accidental. Additionally, they argued that the gunshot wound, not just the gangrene, was a proximate cause of the amputation, disqualifying the loss from being solely due to a disease. Both parties motioned for a summary judgment. The 116th District Court of Dallas County granted summary judgment to the insurance company, concluding that Wright was not entitled to recover under the policy and ordered that he take nothing.

Verdict:
The appellate court is predicted to affirm the lower court's decision, upholding the award of summary judgment to the appellee insurer and ruling that the appellant insured take nothing. It will likely be reasoned that, based on the stipulated facts, Wright should have reasonably anticipated the potential of being shot during the robbery, which negates the argument that the injury was accidental. Consequently, the insurance policy's coverage requiring loss solely due to accidental bodily injury or disease contracted would not be applicable in this case.

Moreover, the court will probably determine that the gunshot wound was indeed a proximate cause of the gangrene and thus the amputation. Despite the disease being the immediate reason for the loss of the foot, the resulting condition cannot be separated from the prior injury that was self-inflicted during an unlawful act. Since the policy specifies that the insurer would pay for losses resulting solely from accidental injuries or diseases, and given that the gunshot wound—deemed not accidental due to the circumstances—contributed to the need for amputation, the condition for coverage as per the policy is not met.

The court's reasoning will likely include the stance that the presence of the gunshot wound as a contributing factor disqualifies the loss from being solely due to the gangrene, and therefore, based on the contract terms and applicable legal precedents, the appellant's loss was not solely from disease. The court will find no merit in Wright's claim that gangrene should be considered an independent cause, and consequently, his recovery under the policy is unsubstantiated by the contract terms and established law. As a result, the judgment for the appellee insurer will be affirmed, and Wright's appeal dismissed.
