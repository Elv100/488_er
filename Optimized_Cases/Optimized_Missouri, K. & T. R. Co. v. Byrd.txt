Background:
The case concerns a husband (appellee) who filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Hunt, Texas, to seek compensation for injuries his wife allegedly sustained due to the negligence of a railroad company (appellant). The appellant railroad permitted a passenger coach to become and remain cold, which resulted in the wife becoming chilled, numb, and ill. The wife had taken the appellant's train for a journey when she experienced the claimed negligent conditions. She had been escorted to the coach by the railroad's agent, along with her three young children, in the evening, to await her departing train. The heat in the coach, which had a fire lit early in the evening, died down between ten and eleven o'clock, and the railroad staff did not take steps to renew the fire or reheat the coach until the morning after the train had left. During this time, the wife complained about the cold to one of the railroad staff, who did not take any action in response. Consequently, the wife allegedly developed a deep-seated cough, high fever, and physical pain, which purportedly led to her permanent injuries and the development of consumption (tuberculosis).

During the trial, the railroad company argued that the wife should have taken steps to protect herself by seeking warmth elsewhere once the coach became cold. However, the court charged the jury that the railroad company was expected to exercise an exceptional degree of care to ensure the comfort and safety of passengers - a degree of care that very cautious and prudent persons would exercise under similar circumstances.

The wife had testified in detail about her journey, her physical condition before and after the incident, and the lack of appropriate response from the railroad staff. Medical testimony supported the wife's statements regarding the potential consequences of exposure to severe cold and suggested a connection between her exposure and the subsequent development of her illness.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the wife for $7,300, which led to the railroad seeking a review of the judgment.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the husband. In reaching its decision, the court will likely have found that the railroad company did indeed owe the wife a high degree of care as her bailee during the journey, which involved protecting her from the inclement weather in the coach. It will also be found that this duty was breached when the coach became cold and no efforts were made to remedy the situation. The rule of care applied by the court as part of the jury charge will be deemed appropriate given the circumstances of the case, aligning with the established principle that railway companies must provide such care to passengers.

The court will likely have rejected the appellant's suggestions that the wife's symptoms after the incident, including her consumption, could have been caused by unrelated factors. Instead, the verdict will be supported by evidence and testimony showing that the wife was in good health prior to the incident and that her severe cold, developing illness, and subsequent symptoms were proximately caused by the negligence of the railroad company in keeping the passenger coach heated. Additionally, the verdict will not be seen as awarding double damages, as the jury will be understood to have been capable of distinguishing between compensation for immediate suffering in the coach and for the longer-term consequences of the cold exposure.

In light of the testimony and the applicable legal principles, it will be established that the preponderance of the evidence supports the verdict in favor of the passenger. Assertions that the wife was contributorily negligent for not seeking out warmer conditions elsewhere will not be found persuasive, as the railroad had the duty to provide a warm environment on the coach where she was to await her train. Although there were witnesses from the railroad company who claimed the coach was kept warm and comfortable, the jury will have been justified in accepting the wife's account and the corroborating medical testimony regarding her conditions pre- and post-journey. Any omissions in the railroad's evidence, such as the absence of testimony from the conductor and porter who moved the wife to the sleeper, will further weaken the railroad's case. Thus, the judgment in favor of the wife will stand affirmed, and the railroad's writ of error refused.
