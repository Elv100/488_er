Background:
The plaintiff, R. S. Bearden Jr., owned a hog feeding business in Terry County, Texas. Bearden's operation included a climatized "bacon bin" reliant on electricity for heating, air conditioning, ventilation, and water supply. On August 25, 1968, Bearden and his wife departed their home around 11:30 a.m. to visit Bearden's brother. Their home lost electrical power at approximately 3:00 p.m., and by the time they returned at about 10:30 p.m., 142 hogs had suffocated due to lack of ventilation, and those that survived suffered considerable weight loss. Bearden reported the outage to Lyntegar Electric Cooperative, Inc., the defendant, who restored power promptly after being notified.

Bearden filed a negligence suit in Terry County, while Lyntegar filed a plea of privilege to be sued in Lynn County, where it was domiciled and resident. Bearden countered, claiming the negligence action should stay in Terry County as that is where the negligence resulting in damages occurred. The trial court sustained Lyntegar's plea, leading to Bearden's appeal.

To maintain venue in Terry County, Bearden had to prove by a preponderance of evidence that an act or omission of negligence occurred within the county. Bearden's main argument revolved around the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, contending that the electrical equipment was exclusively controlled by Lyntegar, and such a power outage does not typically occur without negligence.

No evidence was provided on how Lyntegar inspected or maintained its equipment, which precluded establishing negligence on these grounds. However, Bearden established that no electrical storms or equipment malfunctions under his control caused the outage, indicating that the fault was under Lyntegar's exclusive management and control.

The trial court did not receive any witnesses or evidence from Lyntegar to rebut the presumption of negligence, as Bearden's argument relied on the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. This doctrine implies that (1) accidents like this usually do not happen without negligence, and (2) the cause of the accident was managed and controlled by the defendant.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision based on the established principle that a consumer can infer negligence on a public utility's part through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when the utility has exclusive control over the relevant infrastructure and the type of accident that occurred ordinarily signifies negligence. The court will view Bearden's evidence as meeting the criteria for a res ipsa loquitur negligence claim by proving that no other plausible explanations, like natural occurrences or the plaintiff's equipment, caused the outage, and that the defect had to have originated in a segment managed solely by the defendant.

Moreover, given that Lyntegar furnished no evidence to counteract the presumption of negligence, they did not satisfy their shifted burden of production once a prima facie case was made against them. Hence, in the absence of any testimony or demonstration to the contrary, the established public policy and legal precedent dictate that the negligence inferred ought to lead to a decision favorable to Bearden. Therefore, the appellate court will find that Bearden sufficiently established a prima facie case by virtue of res ipsa loquitur, negating the trial court's rationale for sustaining Lyntegar's plea of privilege. The case will be remanded for a trial on the merits in Terry County with Lyntegar carrying the burden to rebut or overcome the established presumption of negligence.
