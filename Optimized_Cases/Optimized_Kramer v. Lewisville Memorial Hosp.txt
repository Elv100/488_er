Background:
The appellant survivors (Stephen Kramer, individually and as a representative of Jennie Kramer's estate, and as next friend of their children, Geoffrey and Lyndsey Kramer) filed a medical malpractice action against the appellee hospital (Lewisville Memorial Hospital) following the death of Jennie Kramer due to cervical cancer. The appellants initially sought recovery under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Texas Survivorship Statute, and later revised their claim, alleging a cause of action for loss of chance of recovery.

In August 1985, Jennie Kramer visited her gynecologist, Dr. Eich, due to unusual discharges and bleeding related to her menstrual cycle. Dr. Eich diagnosed her with a yeast infection and sent a slide of her pap smear to the appellee hospital. Both the Hospital's cytotechnologist Frances Nightingale and supervising pathologist Dr. Richard Burgess examined the slide and found it negative for cancer. After continued health issues and consulting another doctor, Dr. Michael Burgess, who did not perform a pap smear and diagnosed her as normal, Jennie Kramer was finally diagnosed with cervical cancer in February 1986 following a biopsy by Dr. Michael Burgess. She passed away on October 31, 1986, after the disease spread to her lungs despite chemotherapy and radiation treatments administered at another hospital.

The appellants claim that the Hospital's failure to timely diagnose Jennie Kramer's cervical cancer deprived her of the opportunity for a better chance of survival or cure. Expert testimony at trial discussed the five-stage classification system for cervical cancer and its survival rates, with the appellants suggesting Jennie was at Stage 0 or 1 when the missed diagnosis occurred, while the Hospital's experts conceded she might have been as far as Stage IV. There was some contention whether her cancer stage could have been diagnosed earlier, thus affecting her chances of survival.

The trial court refused jury instruction requests aligned with the loss of chance doctrine, which would have allowed juries to consider liability for any reduced chance of survival related to the August 1985 pap smear. The jury found neither Ms. Nightingale nor the Hospitalâ€™s conduct as the proximate cause of death. The jury verdict resulted in a take-nothing judgment for the Hospital, which was affirmed by the court of appeals.

Verdict:
The Texas Supreme Court held that the Texas law does not acknowledge an action for the lost chance of survival or cure in medical malpractice actions under the Texas Wrongful Death Act, the Texas Survivorship Statute, or as a separate common law cause of action. The Court took intermediate steps to reach this conclusion by analyzing the language of the Texas Wrongful Death Act, which authorizes recovery only for injuries that cause death and not for injuries that merely cause a lost chance of avoiding death. It does not entertain this as a separate compensable injury and requires actual causation of death. The Court further held that the Survivorship Statute's provision did not create a new cause of action that would accommodate loss of chance doctrine as a part of its common law.

The Court rejected various arguments in support of the loss of chance doctrine, including its alignment with physician duty, its deterrence value, and the fairness of imposing uncertainty on the negligent party. The Court emphasized that the doctrine would lead to significant deviations from traditional sufficiency standards of causation that the legal system relies on to determine truth and assign responsibility. It contended such a doctrine could have unintended and broad implications beyond medical malpractice cases and could impact legal certainty in professions and come into conflict with long-standing causation principles in lost profits for new business cases.

In conclusion, the ruling determined that affirming the traditional standard of causation is essential to the legal system's integrity and the truth-seeking function of the courts. Hence, the judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed, rejecting the appellants' other claims of error regarding the admissibility of certain witness testimonies and the inadequacies in verification of supplemental answers to interrogatories as waived or harmless errors.
