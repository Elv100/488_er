{ Background: Celia Smith, a 91-year-old resident at McKinney Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center (MHRC), had multiple health issues including dementia, hypertension, and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). She required constant medical care, including anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. After a dosage increase, Smith became lethargic with poor oxygenation and a high fever. She was admitted to the hospital with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her condition initially improved with treatment, but her Coumadin was discontinued. Smith's health declined again, and despite subsequent medical interventions, including antibiotics, she returned to the hospital in respiratory distress. She suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and was declared dead hours later.

Smith's son, appellant Marcus Smith, filed a medical negligence action against MHRC and Menur Beshir, LVN, alleging MHRC staff and Beshir failed to follow physician orders, implement nursing interventions, and perform and report appropriate nursing assessments. They contended that the negligence in monitoring and administering Coumadin was the proximate cause of Smith's hospitalization and infection. Appellant sought survival damages on behalf of Smith's estate and damages for wrongful death. Dr. Summit Gupta was designated as an expert witness for the appellant, but the court excluded his testimony on the cause of Smith's death as unreliable, leading to a summary judgment in favor of the appellees (MHRC and Beshir). The appellant appealed the summary judgment and exclusion of Dr. Gupta's testimony.

Verdict: The appellate court will affirm the exclusion of Dr. Gupta's testimony regarding causation of death, considering it unreliable. The court will find his speculative opinions cannot establish the medical causation necessary for a medical negligence claim. However, the court will also find that Dr. Gupta addressed the standard of care and other related issues for Smith's initial hospitalization, which were not part of the appellees' motion to exclude and therefore should not have been entirely excluded.

The appellate court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the wrongful death claim but will critique the trial court for dismissing the case in its entirety, including the survival claim. It will determine that Dr. Gupta's testimony didn't raise a genuine issue of material fact on proximate cause due to his inability to conclusively link the alleged acts of negligence with the cause of death. As for the claims against Beshir, the appellate court will agree with the trial court's decision, considering there was a lack of specific evidence that he breached any standard of care or that his actions were a proximate cause of injury or damages.

Nonetheless, the appellate court will challenge the judgment on appellant's survival claim against MHRC. It will find the survival claim, alleging negligence that caused injury to Smith prior to her death, was not fully considered, as the appellees' summary judgment motion focused on the negligence causing death, not injury. Consequently, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment with respect to the survival claim and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
