Background:
The case involves the appellant, The Upjohn Company (Upjohn), and the appellees, William R. Freeman and his family (the Family), which includes his wife and children. The Family brought a negligence and products liability action against Upjohn due to injuries William Freeman allegedly suffered from using Halcion, a prescription sleeping pill manufactured by Upjohn. 

During the trial, Upjohn was found to be grossly negligent, and the jury awarded zero damages to Freeman but awarded actual and exemplary damages to the Family. The jury found for damages related to the loss of consortium to Freeman's wife and children, as well as loss-of-support damages. However, the trial court entered a take-nothing judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Upjohn on the loss-of-support damages. 

Upon appeal, Upjohn contended that the statute of limitations barred the Family's claims, the damage awards were not sustainable as a matter of law, and the evidence supporting the causation findings was legally and factually insufficient. The Family asserted that the trial court erred in not entering judgment regarding the jury's award for loss of support and in applying settlement credits due to settling defendants.

A detailed examination of the case revealed that Upjohn could not conclusively prove that the Family's causes of action had accrued outside the statutory period, which would invoke the defenses related to the statute of limitations. The Family's pleading was found to be sufficient to invoke the "continuing-tort" rule, as Freeman continued to take Halcion, unaware of its side effects, until his incarceration.

Verdict:
The court will likely reverse the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees, William R. Freeman and his family, because they could not recover loss of consortium and exemplary damages without Freeman suffering actual injuries from the use of Upjohn's product. There is no legal basis for an award of loss of consortium if the Family cannot establish that Upjohn's actions or product caused actual injury to Freeman. The court will affirm the trial court's decision to enter a take-nothing judgment on the loss-of-support claim since such damages are not recoverable in a personal injury action, being distinct to wrongful death actions. Given that the jury found no damage award for Freeman, the award for loss of consortium is negated, as it is a derivative claim from the primary personal injury claim. Furthermore, because exemplary damages are contingent upon actual damage, the jury's award of zero damages for Freeman would eliminate the possibility of recovering exemplary damages. The Family's arguments attempting to circumvent the requirement of establishing actual damages for Freeman will likely be deemed insufficient, as the court will find that no specific jury finding indicated that Upjohn's actions or product caused injury to Freeman. Thus, the judgment in favor of Upjohn will be rendered a take-nothing outcome.
