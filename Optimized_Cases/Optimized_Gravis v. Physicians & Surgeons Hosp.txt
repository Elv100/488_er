Background:
On October 22, 1963, Elma Gravis experienced abdominal pain, for which her husband, C. K. Gravis Jr., contacted Dr. Philip S. Joseph. Meeting at the emergency room of the Physicians & Surgeons Hospital of Alice, Texas, Mrs. Gravis received an examination and pain medication, followed by observation. Further examinations and tests were conducted, inclusive of X-rays and various medications, like sedatives, antibiotics, and pain relievers. On October 24, an emergency exploratory surgery was performed to address an intestinal obstruction, during which Mrs. Gravis received spinal anesthetic and pentothal sodium. Post-surgery, Mrs. Gravis developed permanent disabilities, including bladder issues, phlebitis of the left leg, and partial paralysis.

The Gravises sued on multiple grounds including assault and battery, fraud, duty to warn, breach of contract, administrative negligence, and various acts of negligence and malpractice. Following extensive discovery with depositions, affidavits, and other legal filings, the defendants each moved for summary judgment. The trial court held that based on the uncontroverted evidence, there was no material fact issue and thus granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment. Mrs. Gravis was the patient; Dr. Joseph was the operating physician; Dr. John C. Turnham Jr. was the assisting physician; and Ruth B. Grose was the nursing supervisor and anesthetist at the hospital.

The plaintiffs contested the summary judgment on two main points: failure to prove the absence of genuine issues of fact and improper judgment despite this alleged failure. However, during both the admission and the operation, Mrs. Gravis was heavily sedated. The evidence showed that Dr. Joseph sought and received verbal consent from Mr. Gravis for the emergency operation when Mrs. Gravis' condition deteriorated, and Mr. Gravis signed a written consent form. No objections to the operation were recorded from either Mr. or Mrs. Gravis, and the primary contention seemed to center on the specific anesthetic used, which medical evidence suggested was standard and posed an extremely rare risk.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. It will consider that the necessity for emergency surgery meant that informed consent was not required under the circumstances, as timely action was crucial. The notion of consent will be extended to Mr. Gravis, who agreed to the surgery under emergent conditions, and this consent will be judged to be legally sufficient. The verdict will rely on the professional medical opinions presented, which will testify that the emergency situation justified actions taken without prior express consent and that the anesthetics and medical practices employed were routine and carried negligible known risks.

The appeal will fail to prove that informed consent was necessary given the emergency nature of the surgery, which will be supported by professional standards and expectations of medical practice at the time. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' inability to present expert medical evidence linking the defendants' actions to Mrs. Gravis's injuries will be pivotal. The absence of such crucial expert testimony regarding the standard of care and proximate causation leaves no fact issue for a jury to resolve.

Therefore, the court will conclude that the plaintiffs have not met the burden of proof required in malpractice cases and that the defendants acted within the bounds of reasonable medical practice. The lack of evidence that any other physician acting under similar circumstances would have disclosed further information about the potential risks or would have acted differently will be instrumental in affirming the judgment. The verdict will clarify that an allergic reaction to anesthesia, while devastating, was unforeseeable and not a direct result of any negligence on the part of the medical staff.
