Background:
Sallye Treme was driving on Highway 59 near Houston with a passenger, Thelma Reinhart. On March 17, 1989, Treme was forced to an abrupt stop after a car cut across the highway, causing traffic ahead to halt. William Carl Young, driving a pickup truck, crashed into Treme’s vehicle about four seconds later, injuring Treme and Reinhart. The incident occurred in good weather and light traffic conditions.

Treme and Reinhart filed a common-law negligence lawsuit against Young, claiming injuries from the collision. Young answered, asserting that the incident was an "unavoidable accident," not caused by any negligence on his part, and cited the emergency doctrine, indicating he had to act hastily without time for deliberation.

The location of the crash was in dispute. Treme indicated the incident happened near a bridge, away from an overpass, while Young testified it occurred on the crest of the overpass, suggesting an obstructed view might have been a contributing factor.

The trial court included an unavoidable accident instruction in the jury charge based on the potential obstruction of view caused by the incline or elevation of the overpass. This directive informed the jurors that they did not necessarily have to find either party to blame for the incident. After Young presented evidence at trial, which included testimony from a public safety officer and Treme, the jury unanimously concluded Young was not negligent, and the court ruled in his favor. The appeals court affirmed, approving the instruction concerning the unavoidable accident due to the overpass creating an obstruction of view. Petitioners claimed no objections about the sudden emergency instruction included in the charge.

Verdict:
The judgment affirmed that Young was not negligent. This is based on several considerations: Young provided strong evidence corroborating his lack of negligence; he was not speeding, as verified by the length of the skid marks, and Treme did not report him following too closely or hear tire squeals. This suggests the unavoidable accident instruction did not influence the jury in a way that led to a different verdict than would have occurred without the instruction.

Furthermore, the jury's failure to find Young negligent was likely unaffected because they had also been instructed about the sudden emergency doctrine without any objection from the petitioners. This doctrine overlaps with the unavoidable accident instruction, and since no objections were made to the sudden emergency instruction, it is unlikely the verdict hinged solely on the unavoidable accident direction.

The jury's verdict did not appear to be explicitly based on the unavoidable accident instruction, as witnesses did not refer to it, and it was minimally mentioned by Young's attorney during closing arguments. Instead, more emphasis was placed on the sudden emergency aspect. Considering the entire record and the presence of the sudden emergency instruction, the existence of the unavoidable accident instruction likely did not mislead or confuse jurors to the degree that would merit reversing the judgment. Thus, the judgment was affirmed, and the trial court’s decision to include the unavoidable accident instruction, given the circumstances, was deemed not to be a reversible error.
