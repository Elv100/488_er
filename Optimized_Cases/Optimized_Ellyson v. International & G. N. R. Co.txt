Background:
This legal case involves a negligence lawsuit brought by the appellant survivors of Mrs. Mary Ellyson against an appellee railroad company. Mrs. Ellyson had initially filed an injury action after sustaining injuries from a collision between a passenger train, on which she was a passenger, and a freight train operated by the defendant railroad company. The collision was due to the railroad company's negligence, causing Mrs. Ellyson to suffer bruises on her head and arm, and a broken left thigh. Mrs. Ellyson experienced mental and physical pain due to these injuries before passing away on December 1, 1902.

After her death, the survivors (appellants), who are her children, updated their complaint by asserting they incurred expenses for Mrs. Ellyson's medical services, nurse hire, and medicine. The trial court, however, sustained a demurrer to the survivors' amended petition because it did not state that Mrs. Ellyson's death was not a consequence of the injuries she suffered. As a response, the plaintiffs amended the petition to clarify that the injuries were not the direct or proximate cause of her death, suggesting alternative causes such as diarrhea and bowel trouble, which may have been aggravated by her injuries but were not necessarily the primary cause of death.

The evidence indicated that Mrs. Ellyson's death could have resulted from the effects of diarrhea and bowel trouble, or the concurring effects of the bowel trouble and her collision injuries. However, some evidence suggested that her bowel trouble was the proximate, prominent, and efficient cause of death, and the injuries may have only slightly contributed to the outcome. The trial court required the survivors to prove that Mrs. Ellyson's death was not the result of the injuries sustained in the train collision in order to recover any damages.

The core of the survivors' argument hinged on article 3353a of Sayles' Civil Statutes, which allows a cause of action to survive for personal injuries that do not result in death. The statute does not allow for survival of the cause of action in cases where personal injuries resulted in death. The appellants sought to recover damages incurred during Mrs. Ellyson's last illness, contending that the cause of action should survive regardless of whether her death was attributed to the injuries sustained in the collision.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the judgment of the lower court and remand the cause for a new trial due to the incorrect instructions given to the jury and the misapplication of the law on concurrent causation. The court will base its reversal on the fact that the trial court's charge incorrectly allowed the jury to consider that the injuries sustained in the train collision could be considered the cause of Mrs. Ellyson's death, even if they only partly contributed, along with the diarrhea or bowel disease, to her demise. To properly attribute death to concurrent causes, the court will emphasize that each cause must have been a prominent, efficient one.

The jury instructions will be observed as having misled the jurors into believing that even slight injuries contributing to death could be considered proximate causes. The court will highlight the principle that only the proximate, prominent, and efficient causes should be attributed to the outcome, and any slight contributing factors should not be deemed the cause of death if they did not amount to a proximate cause.

For the errors in charging the jury, the court will find fault with the lower court's decision, thus granting the survivors a new trial. During this trial, the jury will need to be instructed to consider the entire context of both the injuries from the collision and the subsequent bowel trouble, including their interplay before and after Mrs. Ellyson's injuries, in determining the cause of her death. Despite slight errors invited by the plaintiffs' special instructions, which the court will not use as a ground for reversal, the court will suggest that the new trial provide a broader scope for the jury's consideration of all relevant factors.
