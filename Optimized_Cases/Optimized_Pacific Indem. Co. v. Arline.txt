Background:
The background of the case involves an employee, Ruby Arline, who, while in the employment of Consolidated Steel Corporation, alleged to have suffered an injury on April 16, 1946, when attempting to lift and empty a heavy steel barrel. He claimed this incident caused him such severe strain on his side and back, resulting in total incapacitation that prevented him from working and earning money. The incapacitation was said to have persisted since the date of the incident and would continue for a total of 145 weeks from that date. Arline abandoned claims related to an impairing vision in his left eye, admitting no injury to his eye occurred while he was employed by Consolidated Steel Corporation.

Pacific Indemnity Company, the insurer, contested the claim, suggesting that the employee's incapacitation was due to a later jaw infection which led to the removal of his eye, or due to previous pleurisy, rather than the claimed injury. The insurer proposed that any injury suffered by Arline would only result in temporary disability lasting at most 12 weeks if it had occurred on the claimed date, with all subsequent disability solely resulting from other non-compensable diseases or physical defects.

The central issue of the trial revolved around whether the severe physical strain alleged by the employee was the cause of his incapacitation, and, if so, to what extent it rendered him unable to work. The jury was instructed to determine the causation aspect under the terminology "resulted in" total incapacity—language that was not further defined by the trial court despite the insurer's contention that a comprehensive legal definition was necessary to avoid jury confusion. The jury ruled in favor of the employee, finding the injury did result in his total incapacity and awarded him compensation for the alleged period of 145 weeks.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the jury's verdict and overruled the insurer's motion for rehearing. The court held that the words "resulted in" within the given instructions were adequate in conveying the concept of causation to the jury and thus did not need further definition. The court reasoned that the use of "resulted in" in the jury instructions clearly submitted the issue of whether Arline's injury was causally connected to his claimed disability. 

The court also held that the term "resulted in" is not a legal term that always needs definition and that, on the evidentiary record presented, the jury could interpret the term to mean causation in fact—the injury being a substantial factor in bringing about the employee's disability. The insurer's contentions were overruled because the court found all ultimate issues of fact raised by the insurer's special pleas were indeed submitted to the jury. The verdict was affirmed because the jury had a sufficient basis to make their findings despite the insurer's argument to the contrary. The language of the court's charge to the jury, when considered in light of the evidence, was such that the jury would construe the issues properly and consider only incapacity they believed was caused by the employee's attempt to lift the barrel. Thus, the jury's findings on the specific issues involving injury, its effect, whether it led to total or partial incapacity, and duration of incapacitation were deemed appropriately addressed in the instructions, concluding that there was no likelihood that the jury misapplied the term "resulted in" to reach their verdict.
