Background:
Plaintiff Myrtle Thomas and her husband filed a personal injury lawsuit against Cowden Cab Company (the defendant) due to injuries Myrtle sustained while being a passenger in one of the defendant's taxicabs. The incident occurred when the taxicab collided with a concrete abutment. A jury trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury awarded damages for past mental pain and suffering, hospital and medical expenses, and loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity in both the past and future due to the injury from the collision, amounting to a total of $2,257.85 after a remittitur. The defendant filed an appeal on several points, including the trial court allowing a trial amendment and the denial of their motion for a mistrial to investigate the plaintiff's testimony regarding not filing income tax returns, which the defendant claimed had only a collateral relationship to the loss of earnings caused by the injuries.

The trial court disregarded the jury's initial finding that the defendant's failure to maintain a proper lookout was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages, subsequently determining that it was indeed a proximate cause. The evidence for this decision was already brought out during the defendant's cross-examination and further elaborated on by the plaintiff without objection. Additionally, the trial court did not err in refusing to submit special issues regarding whether the collision was due to an unavoidable accident or a sudden emergency, as these were not supported by the evidence.

The court examined the definition of "injury" or "personal injury" provided to the jury within the charge, as well as evidence supporting the special issue of the plaintiff's future loss of earning capacity. It also considered whether the special issues that were not submitted regarding the collision being an unavoidable accident or the result of a sudden emergency were justified.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of Myrtle Thomas and her husband. The court will concur with the trial court's decision to permit a trial amendment because the evidence in question had already been elicited during the trial without objection, rendering the amendment unnecessary. The appellate court will also uphold the trial court's rejection of the defendant's motion for a mistrial and a continuance, agreeing that the plaintiff's statement about not filing income tax returns was indeed tangential regarding the part about her loss of earnings due to injuries from the collision.

Further, the appellate court will agree with the trial court's decision to overlook the jury's answer to Special Issue No. 3, finding defendant's failure to keep a proper lookout for the abutment was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. There will be support for the jury's findings regarding future loss of earning capacity, with a conclusion that the evidence underpins this determination.

The appellate court will also determine that the trial court did not err in refusing to submit the special issues regarding an unavoidable accident or sudden emergency since neither was raised by the evidence. Likewise, the challenge to the jury charge's definition of "injury" or "personal injury" will not be merited because the objection does not pertain to the part of the charge related to the assessment of damages. All points of error brought up by the defendant will be subsequently overruled, resulting in the affirmation of the trial court's judgment.
