Background:
Appellant employer is seeking a review of the judgment from the District Court of Hunt County, Texas, which was in favor of appellee employee's family in a negligence action regarding the employee's death. The employee, James Smith, was a foreman of a railway track crew and was inspecting the fence along the railway right of way when he was struck by a large lump of coal that fell from the tender of a passing train. He was standing approximately 12 feet away from the tracks at the time. The family of the deceased claimed that this incident caused the employee's death and that the employer was negligent due to (1) the manner in which the coal was loaded onto the tender, (2) the maintenance of the roadbed and track, and (3) operating the locomotive at an excessively high speed. Additionally, the family alleged that the employer neglected to provide a sufficient number of crew members to maintain the track properly.

During the trial, the employer contested these claims, arguing that the trial court's instruction to the jury was biased as it assumed certain facts to be true—namely, that the train was running at an excessively high rate of speed and that there was an insufficient number of track workers. This, according to the employer, was a charge upon the weight of evidence, which is considered a reversible error. The employer also argued that even if they did not provide enough section men, this did not contribute to the incident of the coal falling and therefore should not be a ground for recovery as it was not the proximate cause of the injury.

Furthermore, the employer argued that there was evidence suggesting that Smith's death could have been due to a mastoid abscess, which may not have been the natural and proximate result of the injury sustained from the coal impact. They sought to have the jury decide if this condition was the direct result of the injury and the proximate cause of death. The employer also presented a special charge requesting the jury to consider if Smith's death was due to effects of syphilis from which he may have suffered but this charge was refused by the court.

Verdict:
In the verdict, the court is expected to reverse the judgment for the family and remand the action for a new trial. The reasoning behind this would likely center on the issues raised by the employer regarding the jury charge at the original trial. The court will likely find that, indeed, the instruction given to the jury was biased as it assumed certain contested facts to be true—particularly the speed of the train and the number of track workers—and therefore influenced the weight of evidence inappropriately.

The court will also probably agree with the appellant that it was error to submit as a ground for recovery the alleged failure to furnish an adequate number of section workers to maintain the track, as this was a remote incident and not the proximate cause of the injury and resultant death. This is supported by the principle that only negligence which is the proximate cause of the injury can justify recovery in a negligence action.

Regarding the issue of proximate cause of death, the court will likely agree that the jury should be given a clear charge addressing whether the primary cause of death was the injury inflicted by the lump of coal or a disease unrelated to the injury. The court will suggest that the appellant deserves a fair opportunity to present its theory that the death resulted solely from natural causes unrelated to the alleged negligence.

Finally, the court will have supported its refusal of special charge No. 8 regarding the disease of syphilis; however, it will indicate that the employer is entitled to have the issue of whether the death was solely the result of the disease put before the jury in an affirmative manner—not one that presupposes the disease's impact on the cause of death.

The judgment being reversed and the case remanded would mean a new trial wherein all these considerations must be taken into account to ensure a fair and balanced presentation of the issues to the jury.
