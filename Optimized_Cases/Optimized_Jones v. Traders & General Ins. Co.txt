Background:
Lucille Jones is the surviving widow of Tom P. Jones, deceased, and the plaintiff in this case, acting in her own behalf and as next friend of Tom P. Jones, Jr., the minor son of the deceased. She filed a lawsuit against Traders & General Insurance Company to recover compensation under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act for the death of her husband, Tom P. Jones, Sr., which she claims resulted from injuries sustained during his employment.

Tom P. Jones, Sr., while employed by E. L. Jones (sometimes known as E. L. Jones Construction Company), sustained injuries to his left foot due to stepping on a sharp object in Eagle Mountain Lake. This injury caused a serious and painful infection that spread throughout his body, leading to five surgical operations over several weeks. The pain and suffering from the injury and subsequent infections led to Tom P. Jones, Sr. becoming delirious and mentally deranged. In this state, he drank a poisonous mixture of concentrated lye and cleaning fluid, which caused his death three days later on November 14, 1938.

The claim for compensation was initially presented and rejected by the Industrial Accident Board, prompting Lucille Jones to file the action in district court. The trial court sustained the insurer's general demurrer and dismissed the suit, leading the widow to appeal. The appeal argued that the deceased's act of drinking the poison was not willful and intentional because he was mentally incapable of appreciating the consequences due to his disturbed mind, which resulted from the pain and suffering of his injury. Therefore, the death did not stem from a "willful intention and attempt to injure himself," which would fall under an exception to the Workmen's Compensation Act.

The case cited statute and previous court interpretations, emphasizing that to recover for disability or death under the act, the injury must be a producing cause, even if not the proximate cause in a conventional sense of negligence. The legal framework considers diseases or infections that naturally result from the injury part of the injury itself. Thus, if the injury leads to a mental state where an individual cannot understand or appreciate the consequences of their actions, and suicide occurs as a result of an uncontrollable impulse or frenzy, the dependents are entitled to compensation. Whereas if the suicide occurs as a result of a voluntary and willful choice with knowledge of the act's purpose and effect, it introduces a new and independent agency, breaking the chain of causation, therefore barring recovery.

Verdict:
The court is set to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case, siding with the plaintiff and holding that there is a direct and unbroken causal connection between the physical injury, the ensuing mental derangement, and the death of Tom P. Jones, Sr. The court is projected to find that the injury was a producing cause of the mental state leading to the ingestion of the poison, which was not an act carried out with rational knowledge or intent due to the mental incapacity caused by the injury. Following this reasoning, this act does not constitute an independent intervening agency breaking the chain of causation since it was not a result of a "voluntary and willful choice" but rather from the effects of the injury, pain, and suffering.

As such, the legal principle stating that to be compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the death must result from the injury or from disease or infection that naturally results from the injury will likely be applied. The court is predicted to grant the plaintiff's claim for compensation, overturning the decision of the trial court that sustained the general demurrer, and remanding for further proceedings in line with the conclusion that the decedent's act was a result of his incapacitated mental state due to his work-related injury.
