Background:
The plaintiff, A. N. Wright, was awarded workman's compensation benefits by the trial court in Texas due to injuries sustained from inhaling poisonous gas while cleaning out an oil tank in the course of his employment with Storey, Friebele and Duffey. The defendant, Traders & General Insurance Company, was the workman's compensation insurance carrier that appealed the trial court's judgment. The central issue of the case was whether the plaintiff's later development of pneumonia and tuberculosis was a direct result of the lung injury caused by inhaling toxic gas or whether the incapacity was due solely to an existing case of tuberculosis, as argued by the insurance carrier. 

The trial court had concluded that the inhalation of gas was an accidental injury within the meaning of relevant workman's compensation law and had resulted in the plaintiff's lungs being so injured that he subsequently contracted pneumonia and then tuberculosis, and this sequence was a contributing cause of his incapacity. The insurance carrier contended that the plaintiff already had an active case of tuberculosis before the gas inhalation incident and that this pre-existing condition was the sole cause of his incapacity. 

Jury findings included that Wright did not have tuberculosis prior to the incident, the gas inhalation caused his personal injuries on November 21, 1933, which resulted in total incapacity for work, and tuberculosis was not the sole producing cause of plaintiff's incapacity. Evidence presented in court included testimony from medical professionals, the plaintiff's history of performing hard manual labor without issues for fifteen years prior to the incident, and contrarian medical opinions regarding the cause of the plaintiff's condition. The insurance carrier also raised the issue of policy coverage, questioning whether the plaintiff was an employee covered under the applicable insurance policy, as the plaintiff was employed both by Storey, Friebele & Duffey and the Houston & West Texas Oil Company. However, evidence showed the injury occurred while the plaintiff was working on the Cowden lease as an employee of Storey, Friebele & Duffey, thus implying coverage under the policy.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, finding no reversible error in their decision. The reasoning is likely to focus on the credibility and substantial weight of the evidence supporting the causal connection between the inhalation of poisonous gas and the plaintiff's subsequent health issues, despite arguments by the defendant insurance carrier. The verdict will consider the jury's determination that these health conditions did not exist prior to the gas inhalation incident and were not the sole cause of incapacity. The evidence will be deemed sufficient to establish that the plaintiff's tuberculosis was a natural result of the injury to his lungs caused by the toxic gas.

The court's affirming judgment will likely highlight that the compensation law defines "injury" or "personal injury" as harm to the body's physical structure and diseases or infections that naturally result from it, reinforcing the trial court's finding that pneumonia and tuberculosis were not independent intervening diseases but part of the chain of causation initiated by the gas injury. Moreover, prior case law will be cited, reinforcing that a pre-existing disease does not preclude compensation if the work-related injury contributes to the incapacity or death. The testimony of the plaintiff's ability to work prior to the incident and the impact on his capabilities post-exposure will support the causal link and demonstrate the chain of causation.

The insurance carrier's contention on the policy coverage issue will be dismissed, as there will be ample evidence that the plaintiff was an employee of Storey, Friebele & Duffey and that the policy in question did indeed cover the plaintiff's injury. The objections to certain special issues raised by the defendant will be deemed as not having caused surprise or prejudicial effect on the insurance carrier's case, and the objections will be overruled. 

In conclusion, the affirmation of the trial court's judgment will rest upon the consistency between the evidence presented and the jury's verdict that the plaintiff's incapacity was causally linked to the work-related injury and not solely due to the pre-existing tuberculosis condition. The lack of conclusive evidence for the defense's argument regarding the pre-existence and independence of the plaintiff's tubercular infection will be a key factor in the court's decision-making.
