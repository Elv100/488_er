Background:

The guests, R. W. Cosby and Elizabeth D. Wallace, filed a personal injury lawsuit following a fire at the Hotel Longview on March 29, 1934, against two defendants: the Texas Hotel Company of Longview, which owned and operated the hotel, and the National Hotel Company, which the guests alleged owned and used the Texas Hotel Company as a dummy corporation and was effectively operating the hotel through it. The incident involved the guests jumping from a third-story window to escape the fire, resulting in injuries. They claimed the fire originated in the hotel porter's closet and that the hotel's employees failed to properly warn them or to immediately call the fire department. The jury found that both the Texas Hotel Company and the National Hotel Company were liable, awarding $15,000 in damages to the plaintiffs. They found the Texas Hotel Company was indeed under the control of the National Hotel Company, and the hotel's employees were negligent in failing to warn the plaintiffs and immediately call the fire department, which was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. Additionally, the jury found negligence in the operation of the porter's closet and that the starting of the fire was not due to an unavoidable accident.

Verdict:

The court will order that the guests' personal injury action against the National Hotel Company be dismissed. The rationale for this decision will rest on a precedent case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, in which the same legal issues and facts were considered. The Texas appellate court in the Motley case previously concluded that the National Hotel Company was not liable, and this judgment has been approved by the Supreme Court, effectively setting a binding precedent.

Regarding the Texas Hotel Company and its liability towards the safety of its guests, while it is bound by the duty to exercise reasonable care, there will be further analysis required to establish negligence relevant to the circumstances. Concerning the failure to immediately call the fire department and failure to warn the guests, the court will reason that, due to the sudden and fierce nature of the fire and given the available equipment at the time, the hotel staff's actions, such as knocking on doors and shouting fire, were prima facie responses under the emergent conditions. Moreover, inconsistencies in witness testimonies regarding the alleged delay in calling the fire department, as well as speculative evidence about the porter’s closet operation, will lead to a conclusion that establishing proximate cause between alleged negligence and the plaintiffs' injuries is untenable.

The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows the presumption of negligence from the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents, will be deemed inapplicable in this scenario since the cause of the fire was not indicated by the evidence, and no presumption of negligence arises from the mere occurrence of a fire.

The verdict against the Texas Hotel Company will likely be reversed for insufficient evidence of negligence directly causing the plaintiffs’ injuries, and the case will be remanded for a new trial, where additional evidence or arguments not likely to arise in the same form will be presented. As for the National Hotel Company, the judgment will be reversed with a decision that the plaintiffs take nothing from this defendant.
