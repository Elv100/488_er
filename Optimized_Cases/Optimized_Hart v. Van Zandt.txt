Background:
The patient, Venice E. Hart, filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. I. L. Van Zandt, alleging that the doctor's actions and inactions in both the surgical operation performed on his lower back and the subsequent post-operative care constituted actionable negligence leading to permanent physical injuries. In particular, the patient suffered sensory losses to his leg and foot and malfunction of his elimination organs.

The core of the dispute lies within the surgery and post-operative treatment period beginning in 1951 when Mr. Hart first became Dr. Van Zandt's patient due to a ruptured disc at the L5 S1 level of the spine. He received conservative treatment until 1959, when a new severe pain in his lower back led him back to Dr. Van Zandt, who, after some conservative treatments, recommended surgery.

On October 13, Dr. Van Zandt operated, but instead of inspecting or treating the L5 S1 level as pre-operatively planned, he performed surgery at the L4 L5 level, without visualizing the L5 S1 disc. Post-operatively, Mr. Hart developed new symptoms, including an inability to empty his bladder and a lack of sensation in various body parts. Despite these new symptoms, Dr. Van Zandt did not recommend additional surgery. Instead, he referred Mr. Hart to specialists who identified nerve root trauma but operated under the false belief that the L5 S1 disc had been treated.

Eventually, Mr. Hart sought treatment from Dr. Frederick C. Rehfeldt, who found nerve roots compressed at both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 levels, the latter also suffering from a ruptured disc compressing the dura sac, requiring surgery for decompression. Post-Rehfeldt's surgery, Mr. Hart reported an unchanged condition since Dr. Van Zandt's operation.

The trial court granted the doctor's motion for a peremptory instruction and ruled that the patient takes nothing, which the Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. On appeal to a higher court, the determination focused on whether there was evidence to support a jury finding that Dr. Van Zandt's actions were negligent and that such negligence was a proximate cause of Mr. Hart's injuries. Expert testimony indicated that in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, a doctor in the exercise of ordinary care and skill would have explored both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 interspaces during an operation and that a myelogram and surgery should have followed the operation in response to Mr. Hart's symptoms. Testimony also revealed that delayed surgery after the initial operation could result in permanent damage, as seemed to occur with Mr. Hart.

Verdict:
Given the detailed background and the legal principles that apply to medical malpractice cases, the verdict will consider the testimonies of medical professionals about the actions expected of Dr. Van Zandt under the circumstances, particularly the expectation of exploring both the L4 L5 and L5 S1 levels during surgery. The presence of Mr. Hart's symptoms post-operation, which included lack of bladder control, sensory losses, and pain consistent with nerve compression, will imply that Dr. Van Zandt's decision not to explore or treat the L5 S1 level, although initially part of the surgical plan, appears to constitute a departure from the standard of care practiced in the local medical community. 

The fact that Mr. Hart's condition did not improve following Dr. Van Zandt's surgery strongly suggests that the initial surgical assessment and the choice of operative level (L4 L5 instead of L5 S1) directly correlated with the poor outcome and persistent symptoms, making the negligence claim credible. Additionally, the failure to pursue further diagnostic tests or operations in light of Mr. Hart's ongoing symptoms might be seen as a compounding factor of the alleged negligence and another deviation from the standards of care, contributing to the irreversible damage.

The expert witnesses' agreement that delayed surgery could result in permanent nerve damage will be taken into account, with the inference likely being that the delayed second surgery was a result of the doctor's negligence and directly linked to the injury's permanence. Given that Mr. Hart sought and obtained a different treatment consistent with initial expectations from Dr. Van Zandt, this further suggests a breach of the standard of care on the latter's part.

The testimony from other medical professionals as to the appropriate course of action in similar circumstances, based on the standard protocols and practices within the relevant medical community, will likely be deemed admissible and persuasive. Moreover, due to the technical nature of the case, involving specialized knowledge of spinal operations and nerve damage, the court will place significant weight on the testimony from qualified experts.

Therefore, the original judgments that the patient takes nothing will likely be reversed because substantial issues of fact exist regarding negligence and causation that should be considered by a jury. The higher court might find that granting the peremptory instruction was in error, and a new trial will be necessary to resolve these factual disputes. The testimony of a doctor from the same school of practice, indicating that the operative choices made by Dr. Van Zandt, or lack thereof, fell below the standard of care, will likely play a crucial role in this determination, supporting a verdict that will favor the patient by allowing the case to proceed to trial where a jury can decide on the matters presented.
