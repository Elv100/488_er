Background:
Petitioners, the City of Lancaster and Lancaster police officers (Petitioners), are seeking a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas which had multiple holdings regarding a case brought by respondent parents (Respondents) on behalf of their son Bradley Chambers, who was seriously injured during a high-speed police chase. The case involved common law negligence claims, as well as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.S. ยง 1983, against the City of Lancaster, Lancaster and DeSoto police officers. The high-speed chase occurred on August 3, 1986, when a motorcycle driven by Scott Stiles, with Bradley Chambers as a passenger, was pursued by officer Bentley after running a red light. The pursuit escalated, drawing in officers from both DeSoto and Lancaster, culminating in a crash that left Stiles dead and Chambers seriously injured.

The initial summary judgment granted by the trial court for the Petitioners on both negligence and ยง 1983 claims was partially overturned by the appellate court, which remanded the negligence claim while affirming summary judgment on the ยง 1983 claim but with different reasoning. The appellate court established the "shocks the conscience" test for the excessive force claim under ยง 1983 and introduced a new standard of good faith to evaluate official immunity regarding the negligence claim. 

Regarding immunity under state law, officers relied on the official immunity defense against the negligence claims, contending that they were not negligent as a matter of law because they owed no duty to Chambers and their actions were not the proximate cause of the accident. Official immunity would apply if a reasonable officer under similar circumstances believed the need to apprehend the suspect outweighed the risk of harm to the public.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the grant of summary judgment for the Petitioners on the civil rights claim asserting that the high-speed chase resulting in injury did not shock the conscience, which aligns with the decision framework specified by the appellate court. While the chase was dangerous, the officers' actions throughout the pursuit were not deemed so brutal and offensive as to meet that standard. The Respondents' negligence claim will be remanded after establishing the good faith test for official immunity under state law. The court will determine on remand whether Petitioner officers engaged in discretionary functions and whether their belief that apprehending the suspect was more important than the risk posed to the public was one a reasonably prudent officer might have held. 

The court, in considering whether the officers acted within the scope of their authority, will likely find that as they were engaged in their official duties during the incident, they operated within their jurisdiction. Additionally, the court will consider whether the cities can be held liable under the Texas Tort Claims Act depending on the outcome of the officer's liability determination, which hinges on the new standard of good faith. Since the court will remand the case to reassess the officer's individual liability, the cities' liability will also need reassessment. The court will assess these factors on remand in alignment with the nuances of the new legal standard set forth by the appellate court.
