Background:
The case revolves around a helicopter crash involving a Eurocopter AS 355 F2 Twinstar, owned by Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina and operated by CJ Systems Aviation Group (CJ). The crash, which resulted in the death of the pilot, John Holland, was attributed to the failure of the main rotor gearbox. American Eurocopter Corporation (American), responsible for overhauling the gearbox, was sued by the deceased pilot's family and settled the claim for $2,250,000. Duke's insurer also attempted to sue American to recover the amount paid for the helicopter loss, but that litigation ended in a verdict favorable to American.

Subsequently, American sued CJ for contractual indemnity, seeking to recover the settlement amount and attorney's fees. CJ counterclaimed for breach of warranty on the failed gearbox. A jury trial took place, which resulted in a take-nothing judgment on American's claims against CJ and an award of $78,935.62 to CJ on its counterclaim. 

Before the crash, CJ's mechanic examined the gearbox, which had shown an oil-pressure warning light during a flight, but determined that the issue was likely a faulty oil-pressure switch, a common problem, which did not render the helicopter unsafe for a ferry flight to perform further maintenance. The mechanic disconnected the warning light on the pilot's request to avoid distraction and approved the second flight back to Duke, which ended in a crash caused by gearbox failure due to lack of cooling lubrication. The gearbox had been certified as airworthy by American despite failing multiple rotation bench tests mandated by Eurocopter's overhaul manuals.

The Service Center Agreement between CJ and American included a provision in which CJ agreed to indemnify American for losses "arising from services furnished and work performed" by CJ. This provision came into question during the trial regarding its application to indemnification for American's own negligence and that of CJ's concurrent negligence.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment in favor of CJ for several reasons. Analyzing the express negligence doctrine, the court predicted that the parties' intent to indemnify for American's own negligence and application to CJ's concurrent negligence were not stated in clear, unambiguous terms within the contract. This omission barred American's claim for indemnity.

The court also predicted that the jury's finding of American's negligence as a proximate cause of the accident would be supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence. It was foreseeable that the second flight, deemed necessary by CJ's mechanic and pilot due to the perceived nature of the gearbox problem, could have been anticipated by American. Furthermore, the gearbox posed an imminent failure risk, which was the direct cause of the crash, linking American’s negligence as a cause in fact of the accident. American's negligence in certifying the gearbox as airworthy, despite failed bench tests, was a substantial factor in the eventual crash, and the gearbox's dangers had not come to rest after the first flight, as American argued.

As for CJ's counterclaim for breach of warranty, the court predicted that American’s defense concerning the disclaimer and remedy limitation within the warranty would not hold because they were not proven as affirmative defenses during the trial. CJ's reliance on the express warranty that the parts would be free from defects was valid, and damages were appropriately awarded as the failed gearbox was a direct result of American's defective overhauling work, constituting a breach of that warranty.

In summary, the prediction would be that the court did not err in its legal interpretations and application of the evidence, denying American's motions and supporting CJ's awarded damages, resulting in the affirmation of the lower court's judgment.
