Background:
The case involves an appeal by the appellant insurance company, Great American Health and Life Insurance Company, against a judgment in favor of the appellee, R. L. Lothringer, who sued on behalf of his wife, the insured, to recover under an accident policy issued by the appellant. The 156th District Court of Bee County, Texas, had previously granted judgment to Lothringer, awarding $6,000.00 jointly and severally against both Great American and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company, which had succeeded to Great American's rights. The jury-less trial led to an appeal by Great American, which did not agree with the decision. There were no findings of facts or conclusions of law included in that decision. 

The second trial of this cause was a result of a former judgment for appellee that had been reversed and remanded by the 10th Court of Civil Appeals. The accident policy in question provided for payments based on a disability caused solely by accidental means. The insured, Maymie L. Lothringer, alleged that she sustained a disabling injury after an accidental fall. However, the appellant provided evidence that the insured had a pre-existing arthritic condition that contributed to her disability.

The appellant's basis for appeal included six points of error, primarily contending that appellee failed to prove that the injury was independent of all other causes, that the insured was totally and continuously disabled, that the injury required the personal care and attendance of a legally qualified physician, that there was no evidence of probative value to support the judgment, that there were errors in admitting certain evidence, and objection to the overruling of appellant's motions for continuance.

Evidence presented at trial included the insurance policy, testimony from Mrs. Lothringer about her fall, the resulting injury, and her ongoing pain and disability since the incident. Additionally, depositions from two doctors, Dr. Sol Foreman and Dr. William H. Ainsworth, were presented, both indicating that the disability was caused by a combination of the fall and the pre-existing osteoarthritis.

Verdict:
Considering the evidence provided, the court will likely conclude that the appelleeâ€™s disability was not solely caused by accidental means independent of all other causes. The court will probably find that the accident and the pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis in Mrs. Lothringer's knee concurrently contributed to the disability. This would mean that the disability was not exclusively a result of the accident, which contravenes the policy provision requiring the disability to result solely from accidental causes. 

The court will likely rely on precedents establishing that where a policy limits its coverage to injuries being the sole cause of disability, the evidence must demonstrate that the disability occurred independently of other causes. Since both medical experts' testimonies suggest a pre-existing condition significantly contributing to the insured's disability, the court will probably rule that Mrs. Lothringer's condition does not fall within the coverage terms of the insurance policy.

The verdict will probably reverse the judgment against Great American Health & Life Insurance Company based on the reasoning that the insured did not meet the policy's requirement to establish proof of disability solely from an accident. Moreover, because the rights of Great American Health and Texas Reserve Life Insurance Company are interwoven, the judgment against the non-appealing co-defendant, Texas Reserve Life, will also likely be reversed. The predicted outcome will be a ruling in favor of the appellant insurance company, rendering that the appellee takes nothing against them.
