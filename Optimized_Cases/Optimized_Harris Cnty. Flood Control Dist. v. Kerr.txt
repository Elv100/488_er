Background:
The plaintiffs in this case are over 400 homeowners who reside in the upper White Oak Bayou watershed in Harris County, Texas. Their homes suffered from flooding multiple times due to Tropical Storm Francis in 1998, Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, and another unnamed storm in 2002. The homeowners filed suit against Harris County and the Harris County Flood Control District, alleging a takings cause of action, contending that the county approved new residential developments without fully implementing a previously approved flood-control plan (the Pate Plan), an action which they believed was a substantial factor leading to the flooding of their homes.

The report covered 61 square miles of the upper White Oak Bayou drainage basin and mentioned recurring flooding. Subsequent plans, including the Pate Plan and the Klotz Plan, were conceived with flood prevention in mind, but there were shifts in focus from managing 100-year floods to managing 10-year floods due to technological and financial constraints. The plaintiffs argued that their homes would not have flooded but for the county's actions, and specifically, the failure to implement the Pate Plan would have mitigated the floods. The County's position was it never intended to cause flooding; their efforts were in prevention and control of flooding and that multiple factors, not just the approval of development, contributed to the flooding of the plaintiff's properties. 

Verdict:
Predicting the Supreme Court of Texas' reasoning, it is likely the Court will find in favor of the defendants, Harris County and the Harris County Flood Control District. The Court may hold that the plaintiffs failed to establish a cognizable takings claim because they were unable to prove the required elements, particularly intent and causation, connected to the alleged taking of their properties. For a case to qualify as a compensable taking, the Court would require a demonstration that the government intentionally took or damaged property for public use, or that such result was substantially certain to occur due to government action.

The Court would likely highlight that the plaintiffs did not present enough evidence to show the County was substantially certain that the homeowners' particular properties would flood due to its approvals of private development plans. Even if the approval of development can be seen as an affirmative act, the lack of concrete connection to specific foreseeable damage to the homeowners' properties undermines the takings claim. Furthermore, the defendants' efforts to prevent flooding through different control measures and adaptation of plans over the years may be seen as indicative of their intent to mitigate, rather than cause, flooding.

Given the absence of specific evidence that the County had designs to inundate the homeowners' properties as part of a flood-control plan, the Court might articulate that the County did not use the homeowners' properties for detention ponds, drainage easements, or similar purposes. Accordingly, the Court could rule that the approval of private development by the County does not satisfy the public use requirement necessary for a takings claim, and in fact poses serious questions about whether there was a government taking at all.

Lastly, the Court may point out that property damage was likely the accidental result of government acts, which does not constitute a public use, and emphasize the constitutional significance of sovereign immunity. This suggests that the homeowners' argument would potentially transform the government into an insurer of natural disasters and unavoidable accidents, an untenable position for a governmental entity. The verdict would likely conclude that the homeowners' theory, if accepted, could severely limit the ability of governments to function and finance necessary services, emphasizing that governments can't be expected to guarantee against every misfortune. Therefore, on these grounds, the Court would probably dismiss the case.
