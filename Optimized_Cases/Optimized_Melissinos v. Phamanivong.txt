Background:
Emmanuel Melissinos, the appellant doctor, was taken to court by Thongkhan Phamanivong, the appellee patient, after a medical treatment performed by Melissinos resulted in injuries to the patient. The case took place in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. Phamanivong argued that Melissinos failed to obtain his informed consent for surgical procedures, specifically a "Morrison procedure," and also committed fraud in the course of failing to obtain that consent.

Phamanivong, a Laotian refugee who did not speak English, suffered a work-related accident on July 21, 1981, which resulted in the severing of his thumb, index finger, and part of his middle finger from his right hand. The initial treatment included cleaning the hand, tissue removal, and storing the severed thumb bone in his groin for potential future use. Although the Morrison procedure, which involves using skin tissue, arteries, and bone from the big toe to reconstruct the thumb, was explained to Phamanivong, he refused consent.

Later, Melissinos and others attempted to obtain Phamanivong's consent again. An interpreter, Sang Seunsom, was involved in a disputed conversation about the consent for the procedure. Phamanivong claimed that Melissinos only described an incision, drainage, and skin graft, saying nothing about the Morrison procedure, avoiding the discussion of risks, and urging immediate decision for the surgery to ensure future employment.

The Morrison procedure was performed on August 10, 1981. When Phamanivong found out part of his toe was used, he was distressed and later considered suicide. The surgery led to an infection and subsequent loss of part of the bone in the reconstructed thumb, necessitating two more skin graft surgeries.

Phamanivong was unable to work for most of six years post-surgery and experienced pain when walking due to missing tissue from his toe. Furthermore, the deformity of his hand and foot resulted in embarrassment, leading him to keep them covered.

Post-verdict, lawyers' attempts to modify or challenge the court's judgment played a significant role. Melissinos contended the trial court erred in submitting jury questions concerning failure to obtain informed consent and allegations of fraud. He challenged the jury's findings, particularly on lost earnings and informed consent.

Verdict:
The appellate court will uphold the trial court's judgements that Melissinos failed to obtain informed consent and committed fraud, but will modify the award to exclude recovery for loss of future earning capacity due to insufficient supporting testimony. The court will determine that Melissinos did not waive his right to challenge the jury's findings by requesting judgment on the verdict post-trial, noting that procedural rules aim to facilitate justice, not to prioritize form over substance.

In addressing Melissinosâ€™ challenges, the court will find that the trial court properly submitted jury questions regarding informed consent and fraud. The court will conclude that the definition of informed consent provided to the jury was satisfactory and that the alleged fraud cause of action was correctly submitted to the jury, given Melissinos' misrepresentations about the thumb and toe appearing normal post-surgery.

The court will also contend that the jury's findings on fraud and the decisional element of informed consent are supported by evidence, notably the interpreter's testimony and Phamanivong's claim that he would not have consented to the Morrison procedure had he been fully informed. The evidence concerning lost earnings will be deemed sufficient as Phamanivong was unable to return to his pre-surgery job, where he earned $4.00 per hour, as a result of the surgery.

However, about the loss of future earning capacity, the appellate court will find no legally sufficient evidence since there was no testimony at trial to establish what Phamanivong's potential earnings might have been if the surgery had not occurred. Consequently, the appeal court will modify the trial court's judgment to exclude the award for loss of future earning capacity, affirming the remainder of the trial court's decisions.
