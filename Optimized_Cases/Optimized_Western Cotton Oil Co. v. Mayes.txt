Background:
This case revolves around a three-way vehicular collision that occurred on Highway 87 near Big Spring. The collision involved an automobile driven by Glenn Mayes, a pickup truck driven by Willie Walker, and a Western Cotton Oil Company truck, herein referred to as Western. Mayes asserted that while he was driving south behind the Western truck, the truck suddenly turned east across the center line, leading to a collision with Walker's northbound pickup. The impact from the collision with Western caused Walker's pickup to veer into Mayes's vehicle, resulting in damages. Mayes sued Western and Walker, alleging that Western's negligence was the proximate cause of the collision due to various failures in lookout, signaling, and control of the vehicle, as well as a violation of traffic laws. 

Western's defense claimed that its driver had to swerve to avoid a head-on collision with Walker's pickup, which had been improperly driven on the left side of the road. Western alleged that Walker's negligence, particularly his intoxication and impaired driving as a result of consuming alcohol, was the sole proximate cause of the collision. Besides, Western contended it acted appropriately under the circumstances. Walker also sued Western for damages, rejecting Mayes' allegations and saying that the damage to Mayes's vehicle was caused solely by Western's negligence. Walker's claim against Western mirrored many of the allegations made by Mayes.

The jury found Western's driver to have been negligent by turning the truck across the highway and concluded that this negligence was a proximate cause of the collision involving all three vehicles. Walker was awarded compensation for personal injuries and the diminished value of his pickup. The trial court, based on these jury findings, ruled in favor of Mayes and Walker. Western appealed, arguing that Walker should not have been allowed to testify as to the market value of his pickup without being an automobile dealer, the jury instructions were flawed in rejecting Western's issues about Walker's alleged intoxication, and that the verdict was improperly calculated by the jury.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court’s decision, rejecting each of Western's arguments. It is likely to reason that Walker, despite not being an automobile dealer, adequately demonstrated familiarity with the market value of his pickup, thus legitimizing his valuation testimony. Furthermore, the court will determine that the intoxication issue did not represent ultimate issues of fact, acknowledging that evidence of intoxication is just one factor to be considered in assessing negligence and proximate cause. Thus, it was not a mistake for the trial court to deny the submission of these issues to the jury.

Regarding the damages awarded to Walker, the court will likely find that the jury's method of arriving at the sum—initially adding individual juror assessments and dividing by twelve—was simply a preliminary step in deliberations. They will likely conclude that this initial calculation did not bind the jury to the final amount decided upon, which was determined through proper deliberation after using the initial figure as a starting point.

In short, the court will affirm the decision in favor of Mayes and Walker, finding no reversible error in the trial procedures or the jury's determination of the award for damages.
