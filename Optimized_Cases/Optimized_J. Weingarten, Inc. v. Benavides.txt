Background:
The plaintiffs, N. S. Benavides and his wife Ann Benavides, visited the store of defendant J. Weingarten, Inc., a nursery, to purchase shrubbery and flowers. During their visit, a 50-lb. bag of fertilizer was placed on a large wheelbarrow by an employee of the nursery and followed the couple to the cashier. As Mrs. Benavides completed her payment, the wheelbarrow turned over, striking her on the calf of her left leg with such force that it knocked her down, pinned her to the floor, and caused severe bruising to her left leg and buttock. The injury was serious enough that it required 19 visits to the doctor, surgery to drain a developed blood clot, and the insertion of a drain tube in her leg. Mrs. Benavides was unable to work for five weeks and experienced significant pain, which continued up to the trial. At that time, her left leg remained swollen, and the wound area was still discolored.

The trial was to a jury, which found an employee of J. Weingarten, Inc. negligently placed the wheelbarrow behind Mrs. Benavides and that this was a proximate cause of her injuries. The jury dismissed claims that a child was involved in causing the wheelbarrow to turn over or that the accident was unavoidable, and awarded the plaintiffs $8,000 in damages.

The nursery's defense was based on the argument that a small child overturned the wheelbarrow, and this act was considered a new and independent cause for which the defendant could not be held liable. The nursery appealed, but the only witness who testified about the child turning over the wheelbarrow was the cashier. Her testimony was not enough to convince the jury. Moreover, the jury rejected the theory that the child's actions were a new and independent cause unrelated to the nursery's negligence.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiffs. Despite the nursery's contention that a child's actions had caused the wheelbarrow to tip over, the court will hold that the child's act, if it occurred, was a concurring act of negligence closely related to the nursery's negligence. This concurring act, whether or not caused by the child, does not absolve the nursery from liability. The verdict will not focus on attributes of the child, such as age or size, since they were not provided in evidence, nor in the existence of other witnesses related to the child that were not produced in the trial.

The court will find sufficient evidence to support the jury’s findings that the employee's act of negligently placing the wheelbarrow behind Mrs. Benavides was the proximate cause of the injury. Given the testimony and the evidence presented at trial, the defense that the collapsing of the wheelbarrow was solely due to a child’s intervention will not overcome the established finding of negligence on the part of the nursery’s employee.

The court will hold that the theory of new and independent cause does not apply in this case because even if the child did turn over the wheelbarrow, this act did not break the chain of causation that started with the nursery's negligence. The nursery's liability arises because its initial negligence set the stage for the subsequent injury, regardless of the child's actions.

The court will also address the nursery's multiple points of appeal, finding them without merit. Points regarding no evidence, insufficiency of evidence, and overwhelming weight and preponderance of the evidence to support the jury’s findings will be overruled. Similarly, the court will reject the nursery's claims of jury bias, passion, and prejudice related to the damages award of $8,000 and can refuse to require a remittitur. The jury's decision on the award amount will stand, presumed reasonable and appropriately assessed given the evidence of Mrs. Benavides' suffering, medical treatment, and loss of work.

Overall, the court will conclude that the trial court correctly ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and that there are no grounds for a reversal of the decision. The nursery's appeal will fail, and the judgement in favor of the plaintiffs will be affirmed.
