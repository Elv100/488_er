Background:
The case involves a buyer (plaintiff) suing the seller (defendant) for damages related to the sale and delivery of diseased cattle, which introduced Bang's disease to the buyer's previously healthy herd. According to the case, the defendant sold cattle to the plaintiff, which were infected with Bang's disease at the time of delivery. As a result, the disease spread to the cattle already owned by the plaintiff. The seller argued that some damages were caused by the condition of the buyer's premises, which purportedly harbored and facilitated the spread of the disease. However, the jury determined that the buyer's premises and cattle were free from disease until the infected cattle were delivered.

The original trial court's judgment favored the buyer and awarded damages based on the difference between the reasonable cash market value of the infected cows at the time of delivery and the price the buyer paid for the cows. Thus, the buyer was awarded $1,750 in damages. The seller submitted a special issue questioning if the seller's cows had Bang's disease and whether the buyer's cows were free from the disease before the purchase. The trial court, however, did not submit these issues to the jury as they were considered evidentiary toward the outcome, which was already determined.

The seller moved for a rehearing, arguing that the damages were not wholly proximately caused by the seller's fraud due to the plaintiff's premises contributing to the spread of Bang's disease. The seller maintained that without clarity on the proximate causes of damage, the buyer could not recover any damages, and therefore, the seller was entitled to judgment. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that since the disease was introduced by and spread from the defendant's cattle, all damages were proximately caused by the seller's fraud.

Verdict:
The court will overrule the motion for rehearing. Because the jury already ascertained the reasonable cash market value of the cows delivered by the seller as being $1,750—due to being infected with Bang's disease—the plaintiff will be entitled to the difference between this sum and what he paid for the cows, irrespective of other damages resulting from the spread of the disease. The argument that the plaintiff failed to show that all damage was proximately caused by the defendant's fraud will not be upheld due to the earlier jury finding that all the damage was proximately caused by the seller's fraudulent sale of diseased cattle. The seller's contention that a portion of the damages was due to the condition of the plaintiff's premises, which harbored the disease, will not relieve the seller from liability because it would be irrelevant unless the disease was already present, which was not the case.

The court will adhere to the notion that there may be multiple proximate causes for damages and that the initial introduction of the disease by the seller's cattle was a proximate cause for the harm to the buyer's herd. This means even if the condition of the buyer's premises contributed to the spread of the disease, it does not detract from the causative effect of the infected cattle sold by the seller. Moreover, the seller's effort to argue that the plaintiff owed a duty to exercise care to prevent or minimize damage will not be persuasive because it was the defendant's original fraudulent act that set forth the chain of events leading to damage.

In conclusion, the court will consider the plaintiff's lack of knowledge about the disease prior to the cattle sale and the defendant's full awareness and misrepresentation as primary in determining that the seller's actions were the proximate cause of the buyer's damages. The judgment rendered will support the buyer's entitlement to damages, and the seller's contentions raised in the motion for rehearing will be deemed without merit. Thus, the seller's motion for rehearing will be respectfully overruled.
