Background:
Gene Bailey, the appellant car buyer, sued his immediate seller, Integrity Imports Enterprise (d/b/a Integrity Motors), and the appellee upstream sellers, CarMax Auto Superstores, Inc. ("CarMax"), Phillip Smith d/b/a Elite Truck Sales ("Elite"), and Christopher Fleck ("Fleck"), after discovering that the Mercedes vehicle he had purchased lacked good title, being previously stolen. The 61st District Court of Harris County, Texas, was presented with this case.

Bailey's purchase took place in December 2000, after a sequence of transactions beginning with CarMax, which bought the car for $22,000 in September 2000 believing it to be a good title. CarMax then sold the vehicle through a buy-bid to Fleck, who never actually took title but set up a sale from CarMax to Elite, and Elite eventually sold the vehicle to Integrity for $26,500. Bailey financed the purchase price through his firefighters union credit and received a Texas title for the car. However, the revelation that the vehicle was stolen and subsequently recovered by police in April 2001 led to a series of notifications up the chain of title, with CarMax and Elite issuing refunds intended to reach Bailey, which never did.

Bailey's lawsuit, filed in November 2001, encompassed claims such as breach of contract and conversion against Integrity, and breach of express and implied warranty of title, violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act ("DTPA"), negligent misrepresentation, negligence and gross negligence, fraud, negligence per se for violating the Texas Certificate of Title Act, and civil conspiracy against the upstream sellers. His immediate seller, Integrity, defaulted, and judgments pending cost determination were made against Taylor and Jackson, individuals associated with Integrity.

The case evolved with multiple amended petitions filed by Bailey, no-evidence motions for summary judgment by CarMax, Elite, and Fleck, and general procedural challenges, ultimately leading to this appeal after a third amended petition asserting a new cause of action was struck by the trial court as prejudicial and summarily dismissed orders granting no-evidence motions for summary judgment by CarMax, Elite, and Fleck.

Verdict:
Given the detailed procedural posture and factual background involving various legal theories pursued by Bailey, the court's verdict will reflect an intricate analysis of applicable laws and standards. The court's ruling will sustain the trial court's orders granting no-evidence motions for summary judgment for CarMax and Fleck on all claims while reversing the trial court's order granting summary judgment for Elite as to the breach of warranty claim.

The court will uphold the trial court's order striking Bailey's third amended petition, recognizing that introducing a new cause of action shortly before trial constitutes prejudice to the defendants who had been out of the suit for an extended period of time. The new claim for "money had and received" introduced an entirely new dimension to the proceedings that disrupted the fairness of the process for the defendants.

Regarding the breach of warranty claim, the court will likely determine that Elite incorrectly argued that it could not have breached any express warranty, as it was indeed in the chain of title, contrary to its claim of merely financing the vehicle. Considering the procedural requirements and the lack of notice for Elite on other potential arguments for summary judgment, the court will not uphold the summary judgment granted in favor of Elite for the breach of warranty claim, necessitating a remand for further proceedings on this issue.

For the other causes of action, including negligence per se, negligence and gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation, DTPA violations, and fraud, the court will likely affirm the decisions for the defendants, as Bailey’s evidence may not sufficiently connect any alleged negligence or misconduct of upstream sellers to his purchase of the stolen vehicle. The legal analyses will hinge on principles of duty, causation, proximate cause, and producing cause, as well as the requirements for liability under specific causes of action such as the DTPA or fraudulent misrepresentation.

The court’s predictions will likely be grounded in the nuances of Texas commercial code, tort law, and DTPA provisions; considering the intricacies of the chain of title obligations, statutory notice requirements, and the allocation of liabilities in commercial transactions involving successive buyers and sellers.
