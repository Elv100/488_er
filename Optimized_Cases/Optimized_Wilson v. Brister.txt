Background:
Appellant mother, Joyce Wilson, filed a wrongful death and survival action against appellee psychiatrist, Dr. Ricque Brister, following the suicide of her daughter, Erin Carr. Dr. Brister treated Carr for depression on October 29, 1991, which was the sole treatment session that Carr had with Dr. Brister. Two weeks post-treatment, on November 15, 1991, Carr committed suicide by shooting herself with a gun and bullets provided to her by a friend, Ryan Weigand. Wilson alleged in her lawsuit that Dr. Brister did not exercise the degree of care an ordinary and prudent physician would have and that his negligence was a proximate cause of Carr's death. The alleged negligence included failure to diagnose, care for, and treat Carr's depression adequately; failing to perform a proper psychiatric assessment; not taking appropriate measures following assessment; not questioning Carr sufficiently about her suicide ideation; not involving experts in suicide behavior management; not hospitalizing Carr for suicidal ideations, psychiatric observation, or clinical depression.

Dr. Brister filed a motion for summary judgment, making the argument that he could not be held responsible for Carr's death due to the intervening criminal act of her friend, which he claimed was unforeseeable and thus absolved him of liability. Supporting his motion, Dr. Brister provided deposition excerpts that did not indicate Carr's mention of a gun or Weigand, nor the possibility that anyone might assist her in committing suicide. Dr. Brister also referenced pleadings from a previously settled negligence suit filed by Wilson against Weigand and his father, which indicated that Weigand had pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Carr's suicide in juvenile court. 

Wilson responded by arguing that proximate cause is a matter for the jury, that Weigand's actions did not absolve Dr. Brister of liability, and raised a fact issue on whether Dr. Brister's negligence was a proximate cause of Carr's death. Wilson offered excerpts from Dr. Brister's deposition stating the importance of hospitalizing someone with suicidal ideations, acknowledged Carr's risk factors, and specified that he would have hospitalized her if she was imminently suicidal, which he denied. 

Verdict:
It appears the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for Dr. Brister will be reversed. The reasoning will likely be that the appellant mother has successfully raised a factual issue relating to the element of proximate cause in her daughter's death. Although Dr. Brister introduced evidence pointing to Weigand's intervening act as a superseding cause, this does not conclusively establish that his negligence was not also a concurrent cause contributing to Carr's death. The standard applied will maintain that proximate cause includes both the actual cause and foreseeability. The summary judgment evidence of an intervening cause does not conclusively prove that Dr. Brister's acts were not a contributing concurrent cause.

The future verdict will probably focus on the principles of concurrent causation and the foreseeability of the suicide as key issues. The argument will likely emphasize that Dr. Brister, as a psychiatrist treating a patient with known depression and suicidal ideation, should have foreseen the general risk of suicide irrespective of the intervention of a third person. It will be maintained that even if the friend's criminal act was unforeseen, it could still be a concurrent cause if the psychiatrist's alleged negligence has set in motion an unbroken chain leading to Carr's suicide.

The court will probably disregard the argument that Dr. Brister's negligence was excused by Weigand's criminal act, as foreseeability does not require anticipation of the precise events, only that the defendant could have reasonably expected the type of event that occurred. The notion that negligence of one party can be mitigated by the negligence of another will be rejected unless it is proven conclusively that no concurrent causation existed, which the court will find Dr. Brister failed to do. Thus, the trial court's decision to grant a take-nothing summary judgment will likely be overcome by the appellant's evidence suggesting the possibility that Dr. Brister could have anticipated the general danger Carr was in and might have done more to prevent her suicide.
