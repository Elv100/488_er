Background:
Brayton Gray, an 80-year-old with end-stage Parkinson's disease, was admitted to the Woodville nursing home on December 27, 1999, after surgery for a right hip fracture. He also had a history of angioplasty and was considered anorexic. During his stay at Woodville, Gray developed two infections: an upper respiratory infection treated with antibiotics and a urinary tract infection requiring hospitalization. On January 26, 2000, Gray's condition worsened and he became non-responsive. Dr. Evans spoke with Gray's family about his condition and recommended hospice care, which the family agreed to. Subsequently, Dr. Evans stopped most of Gray's medications except for a few and altered his diet to thickened liquids upon request. Gray died the next day.

Appellants, Gray's daughters (Martha Gray, Rose Marie Salvato) and the executor of the estate (Edmund Higginbotham), filed a wrongful death suit against Dr. Evans and Woodville Healthcare Center, alleging medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment, claiming the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of causation or breach of standard of care. The trial court granted Dr. Evans' no-evidence motion and Woodville's traditional and no-evidence motions.

Appellants claimed that Appellees violated the decedent's Fourteenth Amendment rights by depriving him of his right to make healthcare decisions. The court found that the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable due to lack of state action and that appellants had no standing to pursue constitutional claims under the Fourteenth Amendment because the rights are personal and the suit was filed under the Wrongful Death Act, not the Texas Survivor Statute.

For the summary judgment, appellants needed to produce evidence of causation, which is a component of medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se. Appellants provided the affidavit and deposition testimony of Dr. Eichelberger, their expert physician, and depositions from nurses Judith Anders and Ann Robbins. The court found Dr. Eichelberger's affidavit and testimony to be conclusory or speculative, with no explanation as to how appellees’ actions caused death. The court similarly found the nurses' testimonies to be conclusory, not establishing a causal connection to the death.

Verdict:
Given the appellants' failure to present sufficient evidence to prove causation, which is a critical component of their claims for medical malpractice, gross negligence, and negligence per se, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The foundation of the decision lies in the deficiency of the appellants' expert testimony. As the expert's affidavit and deposition did not explain a direct causal connection between the alleged breaches and Gray's death, failing to meet the legal standard of establishing causation through "reasonable medical probability" rather than conjecture or possibility.

Specifically, the court focused on the absence of sufficient explanation as to how the discontinuation of medication or the withdrawal of nutrition by the appellees resulted in the decedent's death. Without such clarification, the expert's statement is deemed conclusory and thus insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding causation. Furthermore, the nurses' testimonies did not establish causation, as the depositions did not connect the lack of hydration or the care provided to Gray's death, making them equally conclusory.

Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment claim, the court determines a lack of standing and applicability because the rights protected are personal and the Wrongful Death Act does not provide a recovery for the decedent’s injuries. Moreover, there was no evidence of state action, rendering the constitutional claim moot.

Considering all of these points, the court will reject the appellants' claims and uphold the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellees. The reasoning of the appellate court is in alignment with accepted legal principles, which require concrete evidence of causation, particularly expert testimony that links alleged breaches of a standard of care to the injury or death in question.
