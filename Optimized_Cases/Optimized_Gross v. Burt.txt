Background: The case involves twin premature infants, Hunter and Tyler, born on December 26, 1996, at Harris Methodist Hospital. They both required intensive care due to various conditions, with Hunter at particular risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a condition which could lead to blindness. Dr. Kim Smith, the attending neonatologist, ordered a screening ROP examination for Hunter, which was conducted by Dr. Gross, a consulting pediatric ophthalmologist, who found Stage I ROP in Hunter's right eye. Dr. Gross recommended a follow-up visit within two weeks. This was communicated to Tyler and Hunter's mother, Alyssha, who scheduled appointments with Dr. Gross for both twins following their discharge.

Both infants were given the surname Taylor at the hospital, but the mother used the name Burt when scheduling their appointments. A letter from Dr. Smith's office, on behalf of Dr. Gross (“Dear Parent” letter), had stated that Dr. Gross was the pediatric ophthalmologist on staff in the NICU and would contact the parents if any significant findings regarding their baby’s vision were detected. However, the appointments with Dr. Gross were missed due to a lack of a timely referral and subsequent hospitalization for a virus. The family eventually became dissatisfied with their pediatrician, Dr. Yee, and switched to Dr. Stephanie Perdue. In the interim, the twins' eyesight deteriorated, leading to partial blindness diagnosed in June 1997. The parents filed a lawsuit against the doctors and hospital, alleging negligence in treating and diagnosing the twins for ROP. 

Verdict: The judgment was reversed, with the reasoning centering on the absence of a continuing physician-patient relationship between Dr. Gross, Dr. Perdue, All Saints, and the twins post NICU discharge. The court established that any duty owed by Dr. Gross concluded upon completing the screening and reporting his findings to the twins' primary physician. As for Dr. Perdue, her negligence was argued not to be a proximate cause of the injury due to the advanced stage of ROP growth assumed at the time she first saw the twins. Scheduled missed appointments and the "Dear Parent" letter did not establish or prolong the physician-patient relationship or duty by Dr. Gross. For a continued duty to exist, an affirmative action by both the patient and consulting doctor to maintain the relationship would be required. Therefore, without an established physician-patient relationship between Dr. Gross, Dr. Perdue, All Saints, and the twins after the NICU stay, no duty was owed, and thus, no negligence could be connected to the eventual blindness of Hunter and Tyler. The reversal of the judgment implies that the doctors and the medical associates did not hold legal responsibility for the outcome suffered by the twins.
