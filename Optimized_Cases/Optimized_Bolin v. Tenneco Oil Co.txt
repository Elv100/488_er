Background:
The appeal to the Texas court concerns a lawsuit brought by appellants John L. Bolin, Petrea Kay Bolin, Kenneth L. Pfoff, and Gwendolyn Pfoff seeking damages for personal injuries resulting from a car accident that occurred on September 24, 1961. The accident took place on Mustang Island Road in Nueces County, Texas, at a site where the appellees, Tenneco Oil Company (referred to as Tenneco) and Loyd W. Richardson Construction Corporation (referred to as Richardson), had made temporary repairs following damage by Hurricane Carla around September 10-12, 1961.

Hurricane Carla caused significant damage to the area, washing out a 75-foot or more gap in Mustang Island Road. To make it passable for trucks accessing Tenneco's oil facilities, Richardson undertook repairs, which included filling the gap with shell mud and constructing ramps at both ends leading to the bottom of the washout from the roadway. However, the repair only allowed for one-lane traffic and did not fill the road to its normal capacity, leaving a slanting drop of about four feet from the top of the regular road bed to the bottom of the washed-out area. Before the repairs, the washed-out area had a clearly impassable four-foot drop at either end.

The appellants were beachcombing in the area and used the repaired road when returning from their activities. The driver, John L. Bolin, lost control of the car on the soft surface, causing the vehicle to go out of control and resulting in injuries to all occupants. The appellants sued for damages, alleging that the appellees owed them a duty to exercise care in maintaining the road, and accused them of various acts of negligence related to the road's condition and the absence of adequate warnings.

In the trial court, the appellees argued they owed no duty to the appellants to repair or warn about the condition of the road and that the injured parties were contributory negligent. The trial court granted summary judgment in their favor without specifying the reasons why, prompting the appeal.

Verdict:
The court will predictably find that the summary judgment was improperly granted because genuine issues of material fact existed which required resolution by a jury, rather than a judge. The necessary determinations include whether the appellees owed a duty to the appellants, whether that duty was breached, whether the appellants were contributorily negligent, whether any such contributory negligence was sufficient to bar recovery, and whether the appellants assumed the risk of their actions (volenti non fit injuria). 

The reasoning for potentially overturning the summary judgment will likely include the assertion that the appellees, through their voluntary actions, may have had a duty to make the temporarily repaired road safe for motorists like the appellants, and that the changes in the road condition might not have been so obvious as to absolve the appellees of the need to warn road users. Additionally, the court would indicate that the appellants' contributory negligence and assumption of risk were not conclusively established by the evidence in the summary judgment record, so the issues should be considered by a jury. Furthermore, the relationship between the appellees concerning responsibility for the road's conditions could be relevant and may need a verdict from the same jury. The outcome predicted will be that the summary judgment will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for a new trial to resolve these fact issues.
