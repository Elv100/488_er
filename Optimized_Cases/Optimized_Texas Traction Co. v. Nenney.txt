Background:
J. P. Nenney, Jr., a flagman employed by the appellant company, Texas Traction Company, suffered injuries in December of 1912 due to an accident involving an express car. The incident occurred while Nenney was working on a gravel train, fulfilling his duties to navigate a switch at Kirkland’s Switch to allow the passing of other trains. Due to what the widow and minor child of Nenney allege were the negligence of the company’s employees in charge of the express car, Nenney had to jump from a motor car to avoid a collision, resulting in injuries. The company’s employees allegedly operated the express car at a high and excessive rate of speed, failed to control the car when approaching a switch, and failed to keep a proper lookout. Nenney, who was injured about his hips and stomach, became bedridden for several weeks but managed to partially recover, using support tools like a stick and crutches. However, in February following his accident, Nenney contracted grippe (influenza), and later tuberculosis, leading to his death. 

An "Amended Plea in Intervention" was filed by Nenney's widow and parents on behalf of herself and their minor child. It was claimed Nenney's injuries not only caused physical and mental pain and incurred medical expenses, but also weakened his resistance to disease, leading to his death from tuberculosis. The company argued the collision was a result of Nenney's failure to perform his duties, negating its liability, and sought a peremptory instruction for a judgment in its favor. Among other evidence, Nenney's pre-death deposition and the testimonies of physicians were presented, wherein it was ascertained that Nenney had mostly recovered from the accident's injuries before contracting grippe and tuberculosis. The jury found in favor of the appellees, the widow and child, awarding them damages for Nenney's death, which they determined to be the proximate cause of the accident. The company’s request for a peremptory instruction was denied by the lower court, resulting in the current appeal.

Verdict:
Given the evidence, it is likely the court will reverse the lower court judgment and remand the cause for a new trial. Even if Nenney was negligent, it will be argued that the company's employees also had the last clear chance to avoid the accident but failed to do so. However, the key issue will be the proximate cause of Nenney's death. Despite the argument that the injuries weakened Nenney's system, rendering him more susceptible to disease, the court will likely find that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the accident injuries were the proximate cause of Nenney's death from tuberculosis.

Physician testimony suggested that Nenney had largely recovered from his injuries when he later contracted grippe, an illness common during the time, and subsequently tuberculosis. According to medical opinions, though the injuries might have reduced Nenney's ability to resist disease, this debilitated condition was not shown to have led directly to the bacterial infection. Instead, it was a subsequent, separate ailment—grippe—followed by the contraction of tuberculosis that proximately caused his death. While the physical injuries were severe and resulted in suffering, they were not shown to be the direct cause of the infection. 

Therefore, in anticipation of the decision, the court will likely note that a proximate cause of death must be a consequence that a reasonably prudent person would foresee as a result of the conduct in question. Given the lack of clear evidence tying the accident directly to the death and the possibility of other intervening causes such as grippe, the court will likely determine that the injuries were not the natural and probable cause. However, it will likely not warrant a peremptory instruction and a direct ruling in favor of the company since the appeal is based on the rejection of such an instruction and other grounds for recovery may still be legitimate. Instead, the case will be sent back for reconsideration and a new trial, focusing on the correct grounds for determination of damages.
