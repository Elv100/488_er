Background:
The Texas Hotel Company of Longview (local company) operated Hotel Longview in Longview, Texas. On March 29, 1934, a fire at the hotel resulted in deaths and injuries, including the death of F.D. Jones. The plaintiffs in the case were Lasca Graham (formerly Mrs. F.D. Jones), her current husband Frank Graham, their minor son Edwin Jones (represented by a guardian), and the Maryland Casualty Company, which had paid compensation as Jones's employer's insurer. The plaintiffs filed an action to recover damages for Jones's death against both the local company and the National Hotel Company (national company), alleging negligence. The claim against the national company was that it owned and controlled the local company as a dummy corporation and was operating the hotel through this agency.

The plaintiffs argued that these companies failed to immediately call the fire department upon discovering the fire and did not warn the occupants, including Jones, which they alleged was negligence and the proximate cause of his death. The local company's defenses included a general denial of negligence, the plea of assumption of risk, and the argument that the rapid spread of the fire was the sole proximate cause of death. The national company adopted the local company's defenses and filed additional demurrers and special exceptions.

The jury found that Jones had died in the fire and that the employees of the hotel failed to promptly call the fire department and warn the occupants, determining these failures were negligent and proximately caused Jones's death. However, the jury rejected that the fire's suddenness and fierceness was the cause of death. The case against the national company was identical to an already decided case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, where the court had concluded there was no liability due to the fire's swift nature and the Supreme Court of Texas had affirmed.

Verdict:
In reaching a verdict, the court would analyze the previous case, National Hotel Company v. Motley, and the current case's parallelism in detail and evidence. Since the Supreme Court has already ruled on a similar case with the same defendants and has concluded that the national company was not liable because the swift nature of the fire was beyond control, it would likely lead to the dismissal of the plaintiffs' case against the national company. Consequently, the court will predictably reverse the trial court's judgment against the national company and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing in their cause of action against said company.

With regards to the local company, the court would examine the evidence regarding the hotel employees' alleged negligence in warning Jones and the delay in calling the fire department. Given the similarity in evidence to the Motley case and the recent decision in Texas Hotel Company of Longview et al. v. R. W. Cosby et al., the court would likely find that even if the employees were negligent, their actions (or inactions) were too speculative to be considered the proximate cause of Jones's death. Thus, the court would predictably reverse the trial court's judgment against the local company and remand for further proceedings, focusing on whether the negligence alleged was truly a proximate cause of death.
