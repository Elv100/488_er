Background:
The driver of an automobile, W. C. Coe, was involved in a collision with a train owned by the Texas & New Orleans Railway Company at a public street crossing in Fort Worth, Texas. This accident caused personal injuries to Coe and damage to his automobile. Coe filed a lawsuit against the railway company seeking damages for his injuries and the depreciation in the value of his car. The trial court awarded Coe a total of $2,675—$2,500 for personal injuries and $175 for damages to his car. The railway company challenged the trial court’s judgment on the grounds that the damages awarded were excessive and that the jury was improperly instructed about the measure of damages. Despite the company's argument, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. 

Coe was suffering from various diseases and ailments prior to and at the time of the accident, including syphilis, which the defendant suggested might account for at least the major portion of the injuries for which he sued. Both Dr. W. C. Duringer and Dr. Judge Lyle, who were witnesses for the defendant and plaintiff respectively, testified that plaintiff had been afflicted with serious permanent venereal diseases before the accident. The jury instruction on damages allowed for damages related directly and proximately to the collision, excluding any disabilities or suffering resulting from preexisting conditions not caused by the collision. The jury was instructed to consider the nature of the injuries, their seriousness, permanency, the resulting mental anguish, and physical pain, as well as loss of earning capacity, both past and future, so long as these were the direct and proximate results of the collision. The defendant objected that the jury should have been explicitly instructed they weren't to award damages directly resulting from Coe's preexisting diseases. The railway company proposed a separate issue to distinguish the effects of the accident from preexisting conditions, which the court refused, deeming it evidentiary and not an ultimate fact issue. They also assigned error to the inclusion of mental anguish in assessable damages, which the court overruled based on testimony regarding the severity of Coe's injuries and their likely future impact.

Verdict:
The verdict will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the driver, W. C. Coe, on his negligence claim. The reasoning for the verdict in this case will emphasize that the award of damages was found to be "not excessive." The court will determine that the jury instructions on the proper measure of damages were appropriate and sufficiently excluded damages associated with the driver’s preexisting conditions. The jury instruction was thorough in enumerating the types of damages Coe could recover for, and it explicitly limited recovery to those losses directly and proximately caused by the collision. Therefore, the instruction was legally correct, ensuring the jury did not award damages for any impairment resulting from the driver's preexisting diseases.

The decision will likely note that the driver was rightfully entitled to damages for any aggravation of his preexisting conditions from the collision, as recognized in the law. The court will further reason that the defendant railroad company's proposed instruction to separate and distinguish the impacts of the collision from Coe's preexisting conditions was considered insufficient as it was not framing an ultimate issue of fact but rather an evidentiary matter. Additionally, the court will reject the company's argument related to the instruction on mental anguish damages because the evidence presented was sufficient to support claims for physical pain and mental suffering Coe experienced post-collision.

The court will overlook the defendant's objection to the use of "market value" in the jury instructions as the meaning of "cash value" was apparent, and no evidence suggested a conflicting interpretation. Finally, the court will address the railroad company's assertion that the damages were so excessive as to be influenced by bias or prejudice. There will be no merit found in this argument as the damages awarded fell within a reasonable estimation based on the evidence provided. The ultimate conclusion will be that all assignments of error by the appellant are overruled, thus upholding the judgment of the trial court.
