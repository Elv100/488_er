{Background: The appellant insured brought an action against appellee insurers to recover damages to a dam structure following an incident involving lightning. The case unfolded in the 113th District Court of Harris County, Texas, with a jury. The dispute revolved around the interpretation of the fire insurance policies held by the appellant, which covered damage from specific events including lightning strikes. Twenty-five special issues were submitted to the jury, and their findings overall were in favor of the appellant. However, the trial court honed in on their response to Special Issue No. 3, which asked whether a tree had been "exploded out of the ground" during the incident. Despite other findings, the trial court focused on this issue and decided in favor of the insurers, denying the claim. This decision implied that the answer to Special Issue No. 3 was materially determining the entire controversy, despite the fact that the appellant's claim did not rest solely on the condition of an "exploded tree" but on the occurrence of damage caused by lightning, as per the insurance contract.

During the proceedings, the insurers' primary defense was that flood water, not lightning, was the sole cause of damage to the dam. The jury sided with the appellant, finding that lightning did strike a tree and that it was the proximate cause of the dam's damage. However, the trial court issued judgment in favor of the insurers based on its interpretation of Special Issue No. 3. Both parties acknowledged that the trial court based its judgment on the jury's verdict, without ruling out any issues initially submitted to the jury. The appellant's pleading was general and not restricted to the idea of an exploded tree, implying coverage for broader instances of lightning damage.}

{Verdict: The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment and render a decision in favor of the appellant. The reasoning will be that the trial court erred when it disregarded other jury findings that were favorable to the insured and relied solely on the answer to Special Issue No. 3. The appellate court will hold that the entry of judgment based on the jury's verdict is a ministerial act, and the trial court must adhere to the juryâ€™s broader verdict unless it finds a complete lack of supporting evidence. Since the remaining twenty-four issues submitted to the jury supported the appellant's claim, and Special Issue No. 3 was not material to the cause of action as declared and contested by the opposing parties, the appellate court will determine it to have been immaterial and should have been disregarded by the trial court.

The appellate court will conclude that since the appellant's recovery rights were not predicated on damages solely from an exploded tree, the jury's verdict, which found damage was proximately caused by lightning (as per Special Issue No. 2), mandates a judgment in favor of the appellant. Following this, the appellate court will also find the trial court disregarded the rule that requires the following of the jury's verdict as per Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 300 and 301. The appellate court will thus reverse the original judgment and will enter a new judgment in favor of the appellant, with the insurers held liable for the proportionate extent of insurance coverage as issued by each, according to the amounts and proportions set forth in the appellant's motion for judgment. The appellate court's orders relating to the filing of a statement of facts will be rescinded, as deemed unnecessary under the findings.}
