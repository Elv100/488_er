  Background: In 1996, Jerry Hamblin and Thomas Lamont formed Ricochet Energy, Inc., an oil and gas company, with Hamblin serving as president and Lamont as chief operating officer. Ricochet had agreements with Vaquillas Energy Lopeno Ltd. and JOB Energy Partners II to identify Texas oil and gas prospects, create seismic maps, and present these opportunities with a first right of refusal for exploration. These deals granted Vaquillas and JOB a proprietary interest in data and interpretations of accepted prospects. Chris Maier, Ricochet's geologist, discovered the lucrative Lopeno Prospect in 2004, and the involved parties protected the seismic data as confidential.

In 2006, Lamont decided to separate from Ricochet, and during the separation process, he maintained access to company data and offices. In 2007, agreements assigned various Ricochet prospects to Lamont and granted him the right to participate as a working-interest owner. He was privy to valuable information about the Lopeno Prospect, including its estimated value and the optimal location for drilling on adjacent property. Lamont used his knowledge of the Lopeno Prospect's value to attract investors like Rosendo Carranco, eventually sharing the seismic map and selling a portion of his interest in the prospect.

Lamont and Carranco collaborated to lease the El Milagro property, which was crucial for accessing the gas reservoir identified by Ricochet's seismic map. They did so secretly through a company named Montecristo Energy II, formed shortly before finalizing the lease. Using the treasure map and other confidential data to guide them, Carranco and Lamont's new company drilled wells that quickly depleted the Lopeno Prospect gas reservoir, thwarting Ricochet's ability to profit from it. 

Vaquillas and JOB sued Lamont, Carranco, and their respective companies for misappropriating trade secrets, tortious interference, and conspiracy. The jury found the defendants misappropriated the Lopeno Prospect Treasure Map, intentionally interfered with the PGAs, and conspired to do these actions.

  Verdict: The seismic map of the Lopeno Prospect was validated as a trade secret because Ricochet Energy, Inc. had taken appropriate measures to maintain its confidentiality. Lamont, despite his resignation, did not possess the authority to negate the map's trade secret status. Showing the map to potential investors did not destroy its protected status, and actions by Lamont and Carranco, including the misuse of the map to acquire the El Milagro lease and drill wells, confirmed the trade secret's value.

Lamont and Carranco's deception in using the map, and the motivation for leasing the property being the seismic information and not other documents, constituted improper usage. Neither had authorization from Ricochet to utilize the trade secret for competitive drilling on the El Milagro property. Their conduct violated commonly accepted commercial and ethical standards.

Evidence supported the jury's findings that Lamont and Carranco knowingly interfered with the PGAs by using the trade secret to compete against Ricochet in the Lopeno Prospect, thus diminishing the value of the agreements and the seismic map for Vaquillas and JOB. The jury's determination that Lamont did not have a good-faith privilege to interfere with the contracts based on his status as a working-interest owner in the Lopeno Prospect was upheld due to the misappropriation and use of the map being below acceptable standards and without Ricochet's consent.

The legal sufficiency of the jury's findings that the defendants conspired to harm the plaintiffs was upheld since the formation of Montecristo II and L.O.G., as well as the undisclosed meetings and actions against Ricochet's interests, pointed to a collusion to use the trade secret and interfere with the PGAs to their advantage.

The trial court's definition of "proximate cause" in the jury instruction was not deemed error, and the evidence supported the reasonable certainty required for the jury to award lost profits damages to the plaintiffs. The calculated amount was based on objective data related to actual gas production, market value, and geological data. Hence, the jury appropriately quantified lost profits caused by the defendants' interference and misappropriation of the trade secret.
