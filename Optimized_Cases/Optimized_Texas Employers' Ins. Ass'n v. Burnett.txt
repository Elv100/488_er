Background:
The appellant in this case is the employer's compensation insurer, Texas Employers' Insurance Association. The appellees are the widow and heirs of J.W. Burnett, an employee who died from typhoid fever a year after being struck in the head by iron piping while working for Estelle Oil Company. The initial incident occurred on August 26, 1930, leading to a severe head injury for Burnett, and ultimately, total and permanent incapacitation. The death of Burnett from typhoid fever on September 11, 1931, led to a claim for compensation under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act.

The initial claim was prosecuted to the Industrial Accident Board and then followed by a trial in the District Court of Jefferson County, both ruling in favor of the widow and heirs, granting them compensation for Burnett's death. The insurer challenged the Board's and trial court's decisions, contending the death was not proximately caused by the earlier employment-related injury. The court maintained that it was only necessary to demonstrate that the injury was a "producing cause" of the death, and upon evaluating the evidence, liability for compensation was affirmed.

However, during the trial, a reversible error occurred with the jury instruction that informed jurors of the effects their answers would have. This legal misstep prompted an appellate review, adding complexity to the case. It was noted that Burnett's lowered resistance—due to the work-related injury—was viewed as a “producing cause” of his subsequent death from typhoid, which is a germ disease not directly caused by his work injury. Expert testimony presented conflicting opinions on whether the injury contributed to Burnett's lowered resistance and susceptibility to typhoid, thereby contributing to his death. The jury affirmatively answered that the injury was a producing cause of Burnett's death, which was the basis for the initial compensation award.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the judgment of the trial court based on the reversible error made during the jury instructions. While the Workmen's Compensation Act relieves claimants of the burden of proving proximate cause, it mandates that an injury be a "producing cause" of the death or disability to be compensable. The appellate court will rule that this instruction to the jury about the legal effect of their answers was improper and constituted reversible error.

Critically, the wrong instruction is likely to be perceived as coercing the jury to find "good cause," potentially influencing their decision to rule in favor of the appellees. The court will highlight the importance of an unimpaired deliberative process by the jury, which must be free of guidance regarding the implications of their determinations.

On the substance of the case itself, the appellate court will find that there remains a factual issue regarding whether Burnett's work-related injury was a "producing cause" of his death that a jury should resolve without improper guidance from the court. The appellate court will also reference previous case law emphasizing the necessity of proving a continuous chain of causation that is not interrupted by an independent agency unless the injury operates through the independent agency and contributes to the resulting condition or death.

Despite the error in jury instruction, the appellate court will not necessarily negate the underlying causation findings. Instead, it will remand for a new trial where these issues can be properly addressed and decided based on lawful court instructions and without improperly influencing the jury's responses.
