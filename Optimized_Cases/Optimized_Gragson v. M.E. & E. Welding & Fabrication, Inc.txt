Background:
Plaintiffs Charles Gragson and his wife filed a premises liability lawsuit against M.E.&E. Welding & Fabrication, Inc. following an incident where Charles Gragson, an employee of Anchor Crane & Hoist, Inc., fell through a hole in a roof. The hole had been created and covered by a sheet of plywood by M.E.&E. The 124th Judicial District Court in Gregg County, Texas, ruled in favor of a take-nothing judgment, effectively ruling against the employee and his wife. They then appealed the decision.

The case presented Charles Gragson as a new employee with only thirteen days of employment at Anchor Crane. He was receiving on-the-job training and was on the roof with senior service technician Roy Riffel to replace a motor on a crane. The hole, over the top of a paint room, had been created to allow the lifting of heavy items with a crane. Although Riffel was aware of the hole, evidence regarding whether Gragson had been informed about it was conflicting. When M.E.&E. offered scaffolding to ensure safety, Riffel declined, citing time constraints. Safety gear such as safety belts, tie-offs, and lanyards were in the Anchor Crane truck, but neither Riffel nor Gragson utilized them.

The jury concluded that Anchor Crane's conduct was the sole proximate cause of Gragson's injuries, thereby excluding M.E.&E. from liability. The court then assessed costs against Wausau, the workers' compensation carrier that had intervened in the lawsuit seeking recovery for money paid to Gragson. On appeal, Gragson challenged the submission of a jury question on sole proximate cause, claiming there was no legal or factual basis for it and that the evidence did not support the jury's response. Wausau additionally challenged the assessment of all taxable court costs against it, arguing that it should not bear the entire cost due to its limited involvement in the proceedings.

Verdict:
The appeals court stated that questions and instructions that are raised by evidence must be submitted to the jury, and juries are entitled to deliberate on the doctrine of sole proximate cause if the evidence supports it. They determined that the evidence indicated that Anchor Crane 1) knew of the hole, 2) did not inform Gragson about it, 3) refused the offer to set up a scaffold, 4) chose not to use available safety equipment, 5) failed to instruct Gragson on safety measures for working at a height, and 6) did not inspect the work area prior to beginning repairs. This evidence substantiated the submission of the sole proximate cause defense and supported the verdict.

Moreover, the appellate court found that Gragson failed to preserve his argument that a sole proximate cause question could only be submitted as an instruction, not as a question, by not objecting during trial. The jury's determination of sole proximate cause was also found legally and factually sufficient. The foreseeability of the injury due to Anchor Crane's conduct and inaction was held to be reasonable given the evidence.

With regard to taxable court costs, the appellate court agreed that the trial court acted within its discretion by assessing Wausau for court costs due to its substantial financial interest in the case, represented by a lien on any recovery amount. Nonetheless, the appeals court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by charging Wausau with all the costs, given its minimal participation in the lawsuit compared to Gragson. The judgment was reformed to assess costs jointly and severally against both Gragson and Wausau.

As a result, the appeals court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects except for the allocation of court costs, which they reformed. They upheld the jury's finding that Anchor Crane's actions were the sole proximate cause of Gragson's injuries, absolving M.E.&E. of liability in the premises liability suit. Moreover, they supported the decision that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury's verdict and denied Gragson's numerous grounds for appeal.
