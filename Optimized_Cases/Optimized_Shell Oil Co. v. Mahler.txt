Background:
The plaintiff, who held a grazing lease on one hundred acres of land owned by a Mrs. Carson, encountered a tragic loss on April 27 when six of his cows were found dead. They lay in a row over a sizzling wire that had fallen between two poles owned by the defendant, Shell Oil Company. One of these poles was situated near Carson No. 2, one of two oil wells owned by the defendant on the same land. While Carson No. 1 was still in production as of April 1963, Carson No. 2 had not been in operation. The jury found that the defendant's act of leaving the power line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well's disconnection amounted to negligence and was the proximate cause of the cattle’s deaths.

An account by the defendant’s Production Foreman for Archer County outlined the history of Carson No. 2: It was originally electrically operated from December 1951 until 1955 when a gas engine replaced the electricity. The original power lines remained despite the switch. Electric power was reintroduced in March 1959 once it became purchasable. The well was temporarily abandoned in December 1961, and although not plugged, it was officially abandoned with the Railroad Commission's approval on January 8, 1962. The casing remained in the well and electrical power was disconnected in a manner deemed safe and customary for temporary disconnections at a pumping unit installation.

There was consensus that a lightning bolt striking a phase of the power line during the night of April 26—which had a thunderstorm with lightning—caused the wire to burn, break loose, and fall. There was no evidence suggesting that lightning is more likely to strike a charged wire compared to a "cold" or inactive one. Additionally, there were no presented allegations of defective equipment, failure to conduct proper inspections, or violation of regulatory statutes by the defendant.

The plaintiff referred to Texas Power & Light Co. v. Culwell as a case precedent. However, that precedent stressed the feasibility and practicability of insulating wire to prevent the escape of electric current in case of contact with another object. This case, contrastingly, lacked evidence indicating that the defendant's actions or inactions constituted negligence. Moreover, no testimony contested the defense's claim that the power was disconnected in a secure and accepted fashion. Based on the lack of evidence pointing to any increased hazard following the cessation of activities at the well, a duty to act differently by the defendant was not established.

Verdict:
The verdict was that the plaintiff's loss of cattle could not be legally attributed to the defendant's negligence. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff from the trial court was overturned, and a new judgment was rendered for the defendant. This conclusion is reached because there was inadequate proof that the defendant's conduct—leaving the line to Carson No. 2 charged with electricity after the well was abandoned—created a hazard significantly greater than before the well's production ceased.

Furthermore, it was found that the defendant's method of disconnecting the electrical power, considered safe and industry standard, was not challenged by any credible evidence that suggested an alternative practice should have been employed. Since the occurrence of lightning striking the wire was unforeseeable, and in the absence of proof that a charged wire posed a greater risk than an inactive one, there was no basis for a foreseeable risk that could have been averted by the defendant.

The court aligned with previous cases determining that without evidence demonstrating an increased danger due to the charged wire, no duty or negligence can be established, and the occurrence of an accident alone does not constitute liability if the consequences were not reasonably foreseeable. As a result, the defendant was found not liable as there was no established negligence or proximate cause linking their action or inaction to the tragic incident involving the plaintiff’s cattle.
