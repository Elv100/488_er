Background: 
The appellant, a power company, sought review of the decision from the trial court in Texas that found in favor of the appellee survivors of the decedents in a negligence suit. The decedents included Doc Franklin Webster and two others who were killed by coming into contact with the appellant's transmission line that was brought down by a lightning strike. The tragic event occurred after the decedents' car stopped, presumably out of gasoline, and they went to search for fuel, ending up in a cotton field where the sagging power lines were located. The farm was owned by J. M. Carter and rented to Mr. Mack Atnip but cultivated by a tenant named Frog Jackson. The lines were supposed to be at least 22 feet above ground as per statutory requirements, but due to the lightning strike, they were sagging about 3 feet above ground at the time of the incident.

Doc Webster was traveling with his wife, brother, and brother-in-law, looking for work but could not find any due to excessive rains. They were returning home when their car ceased to function. Webster's brother, Tom Webster, and brother-in-law, Bowen Daniels, left in search of gasoline, while Doc and his wife remained in the car. It was alleged that Tom and Bowen inadvertently wandered into the field where the power line was sagging and were electrocuted. Hearing calls for help, Doc went to assist and was also electrocuted. 

The appellees' suit argued that the power company was negligent in various ways, including not maintaining the minimum height for its power lines, failing to warn persons of the low-hanging wires, failing to cut off electricity to the sagging lines, allowing the wires to fall and remain near the ground, and not having a watchman present to caution individuals about the condition. The appellant countered with claims including a general demurrer pleading that the decedents were trespassers; pleas of unavoidable accident; an act of God (lightning); contributory negligence of the deceased; and that deceased, at the time of death, was trespassing upon the premises.

The trial court overruled the appellant's general demurrer, did not instruct a verdict in the appellant's favor on the trespassing claim, and submitted the case to a jury, which found in favor of the appellees. The jury found the power company's actions to be actionable negligence and absolved Doc Webster of negligence. The appellant did not dispute the juryâ€™s findings but maintained that the court erred in various ways, including in refusing to instruct a verdict on account of trespassing, not defining certain phrases in the court's definition of proximate cause, and objecting to issues submitted on the measure of damages. The trial court's judgment awarded damages to the beneficiaries of the decedents, totaling $23,000.

Verdict:
It will be predicted that the appellate court will affirm the decision of the lower court that found in favor of the appellee survivors of the decedents in the negligence suit brought against the appellant power company. This affirmation will be based on the finding that the lower court did not err in overruling the appellant's general demurrer. The decedents will have been found not to be trespassers at the time of their deaths, and the power company owed a duty of care to individuals that could reasonably be expected to be within the vicinity of the sagging lines. The court will likely determine that the appellant acquired right of way through a deed by the owner for the purpose of constructing and maintaining power lines and did not prevent the owner, or anyone else, from using the ground under the lines so long as such use was consistent with the reasonable enjoyment of the easement. 

The court will probably affirm the trial court's instruction to the jury on the negligence of appellant in not repairing the lines after being aware of their condition and keeping them charged with electricity. The existence of a communal custom allowing passage through lands cannot be used to classify an individual as a trespasser under such circumstances. Furthermore, the court will likely consider the response to a distress call, not as trespassing, but as an action to help others in distress, which would be expected of any reasonable person. 

The appellant's multiple objections to the propositions submitted to the jury will be considered immaterial because the facts supporting the propositions will be found to be undisputed, including the reception of notice of the line's condition and the failure to make repairs or issue warnings. 

The contributory negligence claim will not have been raised by the evidence, as the decedents could not have anticipated the presence of the low-hanging wires and had not been informed of any potential danger. The issues surrounding contributory negligence and acts of God would have been correctly refused by the trial court since they were not supported by the evidence. Any errors in the court proceedings the appellant contends, such as the exclusion of certain testimonies, admission of notice evidence, or definitions within instructions, will be considered harmless in the overall determination of the company's negligence and will not warrant a reversal of the judgment. Thus, the appellant's motion for rehearing will be overruled, and the original judgment will stand affirmed.
