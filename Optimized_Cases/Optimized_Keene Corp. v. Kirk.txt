Background:
Ollis Kirk and Josephine Wittner, appellee employees, were exposed to asbestos-containing products while employed at Alabama shipyards and subsequently developed asbestos-related diseases. They sued Keene Corporation and others, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and products liability. Following a jury trial, the appellees were awarded $100,000 each in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 each in punitive damages. 

Keene Corporation appealed the verdict, arguing that the trial court made several errors: improper definitions of "proximate cause" and "unreasonably dangerous" were submitted to the jury, "wantonness" was submitted as an independent theory of recovery, cross-examination of an expert witness was improperly limited, and punitive damages awarded violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Keene Corporation challenged the trial court's definition of "proximate cause" for omitting the element of foreseeability, and in the definition of "unreasonably dangerous," they argued that it applied only to manufacturing-defect theory and not to marketing-defect or failure-to-warn theory, which was relevant to the case. Moreover, Keene Corporation contested the punitive damages arguing their repetitive awards for the same conduct was unconstitutional and violated due process. They pointed out their liability for a significant amount in punitive damages from various asbestos cases.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellee employees. The arguments regarding the definitions of "proximate cause" and "unreasonably dangerous" will be found without merit because the definitions submitted were consistent with Alabama law and adequately provided the jury with the standard needed for their deliberation. The foreseeability element, although not explicitly stated, will be found to be implicit in the phrase “natural and probable sequence of events.”

In the matter of the court limiting cross-examination of Dr. Joseph K. Wagoner, the court will find no abuse of discretion. It will be determined that the trial court did not err in excluding criticism of the expert's past research as it was not shown to be directly relevant to the case at hand, and there was no adverse ruling on this evidence's admissibility.

Regarding punitive damages, the appellate court will reject Keene Corporation's due process arguments. It will be held that punitive damages can legally be assessed for each party entitled and that the awards in this case did not exceed amounts necessary to punish and deter future misconduct. The awards were in line with the jury's prerogative to punish for the reprehensibility of the defendant's actions and to deter similar future conduct. The contention that punitive damages were excessive or unconstitutional will be deemed unpersuasive as punitive damages are intended to set an example and serve societal interest in retribution and deterrence, and no appellate court precedent exists that repetitive awards of punitive damages for the same conduct violate due process.

In conclusion, all of Keene Corporation's points of error will be overruled, including the handling of jury instructions, limitations on cross-examination, and the upholding of punitive damage awards. The appellate court will find that the trial court acted within its discretion and followed the appropriate legal standards, and thus the appellee employees' awards will be upheld.
