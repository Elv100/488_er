Background:
The case involves two related wrongful death and survival actions brought by the estates of victims (respondents) against the petitioner alcohol beverage licensees (El Chico Corporation and Joleemo, Inc.) in Texas. The victims died in separate incidents involving intoxicated drivers who had been served alcoholic beverages by the petitioners. The lower courts initially dismissed the cases, one by summary judgment and the other for failure to state a cause of action. However, upon appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissals, determining that the matters should proceed to trial.

In the first case, El Chico v. Poole, the Pooles sued El Chico Corporation and Rene Saenz for the death of their son, Larry. El Chico served alcohol to Saenz, an admitted alcoholic who "blacked out" and couldn't remember the events leading to the accident where he collided with Larry's car after running a red light. Saenz's intoxication was evident at the scene of the collision, and a breath alcohol test showed a reading of 0.18. The appeals court found that El Chico owed a duty to the public not to serve alcohol to an already intoxicated person and that whether El Chico breached this duty and caused the Pooles' damages was for a jury to decide.

In the second case, Joleemo v. Evans, the Evanses sued Joleemo, Inc., d/b/a Bandy's, for the death of their son, Patrick, alleging that Bandy's continued to serve alcohol to Henry Scott Smith even though they knew or should have known he was intoxicated. Smith later hit Patrick's motorcycle. The lower court dismissed this case for failing to state a cause of action, but the appeals court reversed, holding that a tavern owner who continues to serve an intoxicated person may owe a duty to third persons.

Both El Chico and Joleemo subsequently sought review, arguing that without a legislative dramshop act explicitly creating a civil remedy and cause of action against alcohol beverage licensees, no cause of action could be maintained against them.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the reversal of the lower courts' dismissals, upholding the decisions of the Court of Appeals. The verdict will acknowledge that alcoholic beverage licensees owe a duty to the general public not to serve alcoholic beverages to a person when the licensee knows or should have known the patron was intoxicated. Serving alcohol to an already intoxicated person who is likely to drive constitutes negligence as a matter of law. Whether each petitioner breached their duty and if that breach proximately caused the victims' injuries and deaths, taking into account the concepts of cause in fact and foreseeability, will be determined as an issue of fact for a jury to decide.

The verdict will be guided by a combination of common law negligence principles and statutory standards of conduct under the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, specifically Section 101.63(a), which prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons. The court will hold that the statute embodies a reasonable standard of care that serves to protect the welfare, health, peace, temperance, and safety of the public.

Furthermore, the petitioners' argument that the absence of a legislative dramshop act equates to no civil cause of action will be rejected. The court will note that the regulation of alcoholic beverages does not preclude the applicability of civil standards of conduct. The court will emphasize that the common law of torts evolves with society's changes, and as such, courts must recognize the evolution of these principles and acknowledge the legislative efforts to protect the public from the hazards associated with intoxication and driving.

Lastly, the court will dismiss concern that the announced rule is overly burdensome on licensees, stating that they are already bound by law to control the amount of alcohol served. Petitioners are expected only to exercise reasonable care in discontinuing service to patrons they know or should know are intoxicated. The establishment of this cause of action aims to incentivize compliance with safety regulations, ensure justice for victims, and affirm that every person has a duty to prevent foreseeable risks of injury to others. As such, the cause of action announced will stand as valid under the principles of negligence owed to all individuals in society.
