Background:
Courtney McKenzie-Thue, at the age of 33 and suffering from a rare cancer of the appendix, agreed to undergo a procedure called HIPEC at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. This procedure, undertaken as part of a clinical trial designed by Wake Forest Medical School, involved extensive surgery to remove visible cancer and a perfusion of the peritoneal cavity with chemotherapy drugs mixed with a carrier fluid. McKenzie-Thue was randomly selected to receive the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin, and pursuant to the trial protocol, the hospital used a sugar water solution (D5W) as the carrier agent. D5W can cause hyponatremia, which leads to swelling of cells, and to counteract this, the hospital administered an insulin and saline IV drip during surgery. Despite this, McKenzie-Thue developed brain swelling (due to hyponatremia) and died two days after surgery.

The McKenzie family alleged that the hospital was negligent in using D5W as it was not the appropriate fluid under the circumstances and posed a significant risk of serious harm leading to the condition from which McKenzie-Thue died. Dr. David Miller, the expert witness for the McKenzies, stated in his report that the misuse of fluid was the probable cause of death. The hospital filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting it was immune from suit, arguing (1) the D5W was used by an independent contractor, not the hospital, and (2) the harm was not foreseeable, precluding a proximate cause.

The trial court denied the hospital’s plea to the jurisdiction, and this was affirmed by the court of appeals. The hospital's appeal to the Texas Supreme Court focused on whether the negligence claim was premised on the improper use of the D5W property under the Texas Tort Claims Act and whether McKenzie-Thue's death was unforeseeable.

Verdict:
The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment that governmental immunity was waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act. The plaintiffs’ claim was established as being premised on the hospital's use of a carrier agent that was improper under the circumstances and caused harm, which was sufficient to establish negligent "use" under the Act. The use of D5W as a carrier agent in large doses exposed the patient to the risk of developing hyponatremia and resulting brain herniation and death, and this risk was known to the hospital, as evidenced by their precautionary measures.

Foreseeability did not require the hospital to anticipate the precise manner in which injury would happen. What was required was only that the general danger was foreseeable. Since the hospital knew D5W could cause hyponatremia and took measures to counteract it during the procedure, this indicated that it was aware of the risks and that the general dangers were foreseeable. Moreover, this knowledge did not make the risks of using the D5W unforeseeable.

The hospital cannot rely on a defense based on successfully administered precautionary measures to negate foreseeability since the measures taken did not eliminate the risk. As such, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the use of D5W proximately caused McKenzie-Thue’s death. Therefore, the case was remanded for further proceedings and the hospital was left subject to the claims of negligence due to their use of tangible personal property, D5W, in a medical treatment that led to McKenzie-Thue's death. The court’s decision took note of its role in determining immunity, not liability, and clarified that this decision did not automatically impose liability on the hospital for negligence, which would be a matter for a future fact-finder to decide.
