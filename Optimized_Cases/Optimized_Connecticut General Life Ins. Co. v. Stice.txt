Background:
Lois Stice, the appellant beneficiary, filed an action to recover benefits under her deceased husband's accidental death insurance policy. The insurer of the policy was Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (Connecticut General) and it was offered through Stice's employer, American National Life Insurance Company (American National). Stice's husband suffered an accidental fall leading to a fractured hip and subsequent complications. While hospitalized, he developed a wound infection, and his liver functions began to deteriorate due to his pre-existing condition of chronic cirrhosis of the liver, culminating in his death. 

The issues hinged on whether Mr. Stice’s accidental bodily injury was the sole proximate cause of his death and whether his pre-existing liver disease, cirrhosis, materially contributed to it. The jury answered in favor of Mrs. Stice, finding that the accidental injury was the sole proximate cause and that cirrhosis was neither the proximate nor a contributing cause. The trial court awarded $50,000 in death benefits, a statutory penalty, interest, and attorneys' fees against Connecticut General. Additionally, the trial court entered judgment for treble damages and attorneys' fees against American National for deceptive insurance practices, as it was argued that they misrepresented the policy exclusions in a brochure.

Connecticut General contended there was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the jury's findings and that Mr. Stice’s death was excluded from coverage according to the policy's terms because it resulted from disease. American National challenged the judgment on the basis that Mrs. Stice sustained no damages from their representations as she recovered under the policy due to the trial court's judgment. Both insurance companies appealed the decision.

Verdict:
The court will likely affirm the judgment against Connecticut General. The evidence presented at trial supported the jury's determination that accidental injury was the sole proximate cause of death and cirrhosis did not materially contribute to it. Considering the testimonies and medical records, the jury's conclusion that the pre-existing liver disease was not a proximate or contributing cause of death does not appear to be against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. As such, the exclusionary clause invoked by Connecticut General, which states that no benefits would be payable if the death was caused or contributed to by a disease, is not applicable because the jury found that the disease did not play a significant role. Therefore, Mrs. Stice's right to recover is not defeated by this policy exclusion.

Regarding the judgment against American National, the court will reverse the decision and render a take-nothing judgment in their favor. The reasoning behind this is that Mrs. Stice claimed damages based on the misrepresentation of policy exclusions. However, since the jury found that her husband's death was indeed covered under the policy and she recovered the benefits due, she did not sustain actual damages as a result of American National's conduct. The damage she initially claimed was based on the denial of the policy benefits, and because she ultimately received those benefits, she lacks compensable damages stemming from the alleged deceptive practices. Thus, American National will not be held liable for treble damages and attorneys' fees as awarded by the trial court.
