Background:
The plaintiff, Fort Worth Hotel Limited Partnership doing business as Fort Worth Hilton (Fort Worth Hilton), filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Enserch Corporation doing business as Lone Star Gas Company (Lone Star Gas), after a gas explosion on March 16, 1986, caused significant damage to the hotel property. In 1986, construction company L.D. Conatser was performing excavation work near the Frank Kent Cadillac Building when they encountered gas lines that were improperly marked by Lone Star Gas. An explosion occurred, leading to shockwaves that damaged the south tower of the hotel.

Fort Worth Hilton claimed the explosion caused severe structural damage to the south tower, citing cracks in vertical concrete columns, deflected horizontal slabs, and disjointed ceilings and walls. Multiple engineering firms were hired by various parties to inspect the damage, with some findings suggesting the hotel had pre-existing structural problems not built to code, while others linked the damage directly to the explosion.

Both sides presented contrasting views on the state of the hotel before the explosion, the adequacy of Lone Star Gas's line marking and emergency response procedures, and the reasonableness of the hotel's operations post-explosion. The case involved complex pre-trial discovery issues, extensive expert testimony, and a detailed examination of whether the disaster response by Lone Star Gas was grossly negligent.

The jury found Lone Star Gas's negligence to be the proximate cause of the explosion and was instructed that Lone Star Gasâ€™s negligence in a previous lawsuit concerning the same explosion had already been established. However, the jury found that Lone Star Gas's negligence did not amount to gross negligence. The jury also awarded damages to the hotel for repair costs but denied any damages for loss of income or business interruption.

Verdict:
The trial court's judgment in favor of Fort Worth Hilton on repair cost damages will be reversed and a take-nothing judgment will be rendered in favor of Lone Star Gas. The plaintiff established the necessity of repairs due to the explosion damage but failed to prove the reasonableness of the repair costs as required by established principles of law. The testimony regarding the cost of repairs amounted to the plaintiff reading a chart listing alleged damages, the names of companies, and the bills for work carried out, without addressing the necessity or reasonableness of the work in the context of the local market.

The jury's finding that Lone Star Gas was not grossly negligent is supported by sufficient evidence showing that Lone Star Gas did not consciously ignore an extreme risk that would likely cause injury to Fort Worth Hilton. Concerning the damages for business interruption and loss of income, the jury's zero award is not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. The plaintiff's arguments did not form a concrete connection between the blast and the claimed losses, thus it was within the jury's province to find a lack of causation based on the evidence presented.

In summary, the plaintiff failed to meet the legal requirements of proving the reasonableness of incurred repair costs and did not provide convincing evidence of gross negligence or causation for lost income or business interruption damages. Therefore, the judgment in favor of the defendant will be made final.
