Background: The appellant, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), was involved in a negligence suit with the appellee, Paul Danesi, a former patient. Mr. Danesi was admitted to UTMB on April 26, 1991, for leg pain diagnosed as blood clots. On May 5, 1991, he claimed to have been given the wrong medication by the hospital's nursing staff, which led to an episode of congestive heart failure or volume overload. Mr. Danesi filed suit alleging UTMB's negligence in administering the wrong medication, causing him anxiety, shortness of breath, and emotional distress, seeking $100,000.00 in actual damages. 

At trial, evidence was presented by both parties regarding the alleged medication error. Mr. Danesi and his wife testified about the event's emotional impact on him, including his belief that he would die due to the medication errors. Mr. Danesi's medical record contained a doctor's note about his anxiety over the error, and a registered nurse, Susan Adkins, testified that Mr. Danesi's records indicated he received the wrong medications and that patients commonly experience anxiety in such situations. 

On the other side, UTMB contested that Mr. Danesi ever received the wrong medication, presenting testimony from nurses that his chart had been mistakenly switched with another patient's chart. Expert testimony from Dr. Marschall Runge suggested that Mr. Danesi's heart problems, not medication errors, caused his symptoms, an assertion which contradicted nurse Adkins's testimony.

The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Mr. Danesi for $300,000.00, which was later reduced to $250,000.00 due to limits on damages recoverable against the state or a state agency. UTMB filed motions for a directed verdict, judgment non obstante verdicto (notwithstanding the verdict), and a new trial, all of which were denied by the trial court. UTMB appealed the decision.

Verdict: The Court is likely to affirm the judgment in appellee's favor. The key consideration is that there was sufficient probative evidence of the nature, severity, and duration of appellee's mental anguish due to the alleged medication error to support a mental anguish award. This is based on both Mr. Danesi's and his wife's testimonies, and medical records verifying Mr. Danesi's anxiety that were presented during the trial. 

Regarding proximate cause, the court will reject UTMB's claim regarding the lack of competent expert testimony to link UTMB's actions to Mr. Danesi's injuries. The court will hold that a nurse is competent to present expert testimony about medical causation, as shown by nurse Adkins's testimony. Moreover, considering evidence in support of the verdict, there will be a finding of more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the jury's determining that UTMB's negligence in administering improper medication proximately caused Mr. Danesi's injuries.

The court will also be expected to reject the argument that the jury award was excessive. The jury is granted wide discretion in awarding damages for mental anguish, so long as the award is fair and reasonable. In this regard, the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Danesi will provide sufficient basis for the jury's compensation determination, which encompasses both past and future physical pain and mental anguish. 

Additionally, the court will likely not find fault in the trial court's decision to submit the case to the jury, or in allowing postverdict amendments to Mr. Danesi's pleadings to conform to the jury's verdict. This is especially relevant considering both sides of the case and the Texas Supreme Court's allowance for emotional distress awards in specific relationships like patient-physician, even without showing physical injury.

Lastly, the court will disagree with UTMB's contention that the previous medical history of Mr. Danesi or the deposition testimony of nurse Adkins was wrongfully excluded, as the court will likely rule such evidence as cumulative and not reversible error. UTMB's challenge concerning jurisdiction based on the damages awarded and amended petitions will also likely be dismissed because the original petition was within the jurisdictional limits and subsequent amendments sought additional damages accruing over time, which is permissible. The court's reasoning will affirm that the trial court did not exceed its jurisdictional limits. 

In conclusion, the judgment in favor of the appellee will be affirmed due to the legal and factual sufficiency of evidence supporting the jury's award for mental anguish, the jury's finding of proximate cause, and the jury's determination of the appropriate damages award. Further, the court's procedural rulings regarding submissions to the jury, postverdict amendments, and jurisdiction will be upheld.
