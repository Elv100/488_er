Background:
Mrs. Simpson first visited the Seagoville Medical Center, owned by PMH, on April 15, 1991, due to a lump in her right breast. Dr. Coats examined her and found no palpable masses or nodes. On June 11, 1991, Mrs. Simpson returned with the same complaint, and Coats referred her for a mammography, which showed no evidence of a dominant mass or malignancy, and her routine lab tests were normal. She visited again on July 29, 1991, when Coats detected a lesion, and on September 26, 1991, Coats referred Mrs. Simpson to Dr. Constantine.

Dr. Constantine saw Mrs. Simpson on September 30, 1991, did not detect a discrete mass, and did not refer her for a biopsy due to the earlier mammogram results indicating only fibrocystic changes. Mrs. Simpson was diagnosed with breast cancer on November 4, 1991, and passed away on March 14, 1993.

Tony Ray Simpson filed a medical negligence action under the Texas Wrongful Death Act and the Texas Survival Statute, alleging that Coats and Constantine's treatment was negligent and the proximate cause of Mrs. Simpson's death. Coats and Constantine sought summary judgment, contending the treatment was not the proximate cause of death. The trial court granted Coats's and Constantine's motions for summary judgment. PMH also filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, contending that Simpson's claims against it were derivative of the claims against the doctors.

In response to the motions for summary judgment, Simpson provided affidavits from Dr. Calkins and Dr. Spoll, stating that the treatment "may have been a proximate cause" of Mrs. Simpson's death, and emphasized the importance of early cancer detection. Coats's and Constantine's affidavits contended that even with early diagnosis, the outcome would not have been different due to the aggressive nature of this type of cancer.

Verdict:
The key issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the appellees by determining there was not a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause of Mrs. Simpson's death. In evaluating the grant of summary judgment for Dr. Coats and Dr. Constantine, the appellate court had to consider whether the appellees negated one of the essential elements of the medical malpractice claim, specifically proximate cause, as a matter of law.

Based on the evidence attached to the appellees' motions for summary judgment, including their affidavits and deposition transcripts, the court would likely find that the affidavits from appellees established as a matter of law that any deficiency in the treatment of Mrs. Simpson was not the proximate cause of her death. Furthermore, the affidavits from the appellant's experts, which suggested the treatment "may have been a proximate cause" of death, would likely be determined not to raise a fact issue beyond mere conjecture or possibility, as required under applicable law.

In reviewing the summary judgment for PMH, given that Simpson conceded that the claims against PMH were based upon Coats's alleged negligence and are derivative in nature, the appellate court will probably affirm the summary judgment for PMH if it also affirms the judgment for Coats.

Considering the applicable standards of review and the legal requirements for establishing proximate cause in medical malpractice cases, the appellate court will likely affirm the trial court's judgment. The appellant's inability to provide evidence of a "reasonable medical probability" that absence of any alleged negligence by the doctors would have altered the outcome of Mrs. Simpson's condition would be a critical factor in the court's analysis. As a consequence, the court would conclude that the appellee doctors and hospital established the absence of proximate cause, and the appellant failed to raise a factual issue sufficient to warrant a trial.
