Background:
On March 23, 1983, Rosita Hernandez Rodriguez drove her automobile over and critically injured a small child. Harold Snellenberger, a police officer employed by the City of Pecos, was notified of the accident and proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, a fellow officer administered CPR to the child, while officer Snellenberger moved back the crowd that had gathered, including the mother of the injured child. While controlling the crowd, officer Snellenberger suddenly collapsed and later died of a heart attack. The widow and children of Snellenberger brought a wrongful death action against Rodriguez, relying on the rescue doctrine.

The rescue doctrine traditionally supports individuals who engage in rescue activities for others in imminent peril, providing a form of legal protection for their heroic acts. This doctrine came into existence prior to the adoption of comparative negligence as a means to alleviate the harsh consequences of contributory negligence. The decedent’s heirs filed suit under this doctrine.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Rodriguez, and the heirs' appeal to the civil court of appeals was unsuccessful, as the appeals court upheld the summary judgment. The appeals court determined that the rescue doctrine was not applicable because there was no perilous situation inviting rescue. Additionally, the court found that the decedent's heart attack was not a foreseeable result of Rodriguez's negligence, thus not satisfying the requirement of foreseeability which is integral to a negligence cause of action.

The case references the elemental requirement of proximate cause in negligence actions, which consists of both cause in fact and foreseeability. Both elements must be established for the defendant to be held liable. Foreseeability implies that the defendant should have anticipated the dangers created by their negligent act. This principle was reinforced in a cited previous case (Freeman v. City of Pasadena) where it was determined that emotional harm to a step-father who was not present at the scene of an accident was not foreseeable as a matter of law.

A dissenting opinion was delivered by Justice Robertson (joined by Justices Ray and Mauzy), who disagreed with the majority's reading of the rescue doctrine and the handling of the foreseeability issue. The dissenting opinion argued that the intervention of a rescuer is considered a foreseeable response to a defendant's creation of a dangerous situation as per the rescue doctrine’s policy. The majority opinion was also criticized for excluding any real application of the rescue doctrine and for wrongly refocusing the case on foreseeability. The dissent called for a remand for a trial on the merits, asserting that there existed a genuine issue of material fact regarding the element of peril that should have precluded the granting of summary judgment.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of Rosita Hernandez Rodriguez. In their reasoning, they will state that the rescue doctrine does not apply in this case because the heart attack suffered by Officer Snellenberger was not a foreseeable consequence of Rodriguez's negligence. The prediction of the court's decision is based on the established requirement that for a negligence action, both cause in fact and foreseeability must be present. The court will state that the chain of causation was broken by the unforeseeable nature of the heart attack, which as a matter of law, could not have been anticipated by Rodriguez in the light of the circumstances surrounding the traffic accident.

The verdict will also draw upon precedents, like Freeman v. City of Pasadena, to reinforce the point that foreseeability is a legal threshold that must be satisfied for liability to attach in negligence cases. Officer Snellenberger's heart attack, the court will determine, was not the natural and probable result of Rodriguez's negligent act of injuring a child with her automobile. The court will reiterate that foreseeability requires an actor to have reasonably anticipated the dangers posed to others by their actions and, in this case, the specific medical outcome of Officer Snellenberger's heart attack did not meet this standard.

Due to these reasons, the court will conclude that Rodriguez cannot be held liable for the wrongful death under the principle of the rescue doctrine, and the summary judgment ruling against the petitioners (the heirs of Officer Snellenberger) will stand.
