Background: 
Patricia Rogers suffered severe injuries, and Patricia Howell died following liposuction surgery performed by Dr. Hugo Ramirez. After complications, they were treated by a team including Dr. Ramirez, Dr. Brian Bradley, Dr. Anibal Hadad, and Dr. Margarita Muniz at Humana Hospital Southmore. They contracted infections, and plaintiffs alleged the defendant doctors, including Dr. Bradley, were negligent for not diagnosing sooner. A jury found Dr. Bradley jointly and severally liable for substantial damages. Dr. Bradley appealed on various grounds, including the lack of proximate cause evidence.

The surgery occurred on March 27, 1987. Dr. Ramirez used the same cannula on both Rogers and Howell and instructed them to wear special girdles post-surgery. They became critically ill by late Sunday afternoon. Howell was hydrated, given blood and oxygen, and Rogers vomited blood. Both had low blood pressure and were admitted to the hospital. Initially treated for shock and potential GI bleed by Dr. Ramirez and the emergency room doctors, they were later transferred to ICU under Dr. Hadad and eventually treated for septic shock by Dr. Bradley.

During the assessment, Howell and Rogers' conditions worsened, with Howell becoming unresponsive. Dr. Bradley ruled out pulmonary embolism, treated them for septic shock from infection, and suspected necrotizing fasciitis. Despite aggressive therapy, Howell died during surgery at St. Luke's Hospital, and Rogers survived with multiple subsequent surgeries.

The trial involving Howell's survivors and Rogers lasted three months, after which the jury found Dr. Ramirez 75% at fault and Dr. Bradley 25% at fault for Howell; Dr. Ramirez 50% and Drs. Hadad and Bradley each 25% for Rogers. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict but the defendants made post-verdict motions denied by the trial court, leading to Dr. Bradley's appeal. The appeal contested the evidence's legal and factual sufficiency, especially regarding the causation of Howell's death and Rogers' injuries, and the connection to Dr. Bradley's actions.

Verdict: 
The verdict of the case reversed the judgment against Dr. Bradley due to an absence of proximate cause, meaning there was no evidence Dr. Bradley's negligence was a substantial factor in causing Howell's death or Rogers' injuries. The appellate court concluded that liability for the lost chance of survival is an impermissible assignment of responsibility based on mere possibility. Despite expert testimonies on the importance of early surgery and debridement, it was determined the evidence did not meet the threshold of reasonable medical probability necessary for establishing causation in medical malpractice cases. 

The court stated that plaintiffs did not manage to prove Dr. Bradley's failure to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis earlier and to recommend surgery before Monday 8:00 a.m. caused Howellâ€™s death and the extensive debridement Rogers required. There was no evidence offered that was more than a mere possibility. Expert testimony about a patient generally faring better with quicker debridement was found too generic and not directly applicable or specific enough to the case at hand. The appellate court emphasized that establishing causation required more than showing a better chance for survival; there must be evidence suggesting that without Dr. Bradley's alleged negligence, the harm would not have occurred.

The judges also found that while the complications suffered by Howell and Rogers were severe due to existing infections from liposuction, the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that Dr. Bradley's actions or omissions significantly worsened their conditions. As such, the appellate court reversed the trial court's verdict and rendered a take-nothing judgment for Dr. Bradley, meaning the plaintiffs could not recover any damages from him. The appeal court did not need to address other points because the issue of proximate cause was decisive.
