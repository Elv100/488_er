Background:
The appellants, Donna and Don Basinger, brought a medical negligence action against Covenant Health System, doing business as Covenant Medical Center Lakeside, after Donna Basinger underwent colon surgery. The Basingers alleged that the nursing staff at the medical center failed to properly monitor and maintain a nasogastric tube that was inserted into Donna Basinger postoperatively. They claimed that this failure led to the aspiration of stomach fluids into Donna's lungs, resulting in pneumonia and decreased pulmonary function. Additionally, they asserted that the reduced oxygen level in her blood caused impairment of her memory and psychological injuries from the emotional trauma. Don Basinger also claimed loss of consortium and related damages.

After the discovery process, Covenant Health System filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. They argued that the Basingers had no evidence to establish that Donna's pneumonia was caused by an improperly functioning nasogastric tube, no evidence of a permanent or chronic reduction in her pulmonary function due to the pneumonia, and no evidence that the pneumonia caused injury to her mental capacity. The trial court found that the Basingers failed to produce evidence of causation and granted the take-nothing summary judgment in favor of Covenant Health System.

The Basingers challenged the summary judgment on appeal, putting forward four issues. They contended that the motion for summary judgment was conclusory and violated Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, they argued that the deposition testimony of their experts provided sufficient evidence of causation to defeat the no-evidence motion.

For causation evidence, the Basingers presented deposition testimony from Lisa DeHoyos Hogan, a registered nurse. Although Hogan admitted she was not qualified to make a medical diagnosis such as a diagnosis of pneumonia, she referred to the medical record where physicians noted that Donna Basinger had likely aspirated due to a malfunctioning nasogastric tube. Hogan highlighted a note made by Dr. Justin McCarthy listing pneumonia as a probable result of aspiration caused by a blocked and malpositioned tube, and a note by Dr. Kenneth Terrell stating, "I think she probably aspirated." However, neither statement explicitly attributed the aspiration to a malfunctioning nasogastric tube.

Additionally, the Basingers referenced the testimony of Dr. Robert Packard, a neurologist who evaluated Donna years after her hospitalization. However, he could not state with reasonable medical probability that her injuries were a result of lack of oxygen from the time at Covenant.

Verdict:
The court ruled in favor of Covenant based on the lack of expert medical testimony establishing causation to a reasonable medical probability. The court held that the summary judgment record did not contain an expert medical opinion linking Donna Basinger's pneumonia to an improperly functioning nasogastric tube. Specifically, while Dr. McCarthy's and Dr. Terrell's notes indicated that Donna probably aspirated, neither note made an explicit connection between the aspiration and the nursing staff's management of the nasogastric tube. Their statements did not satisfy the requirement of establishing cause in fact and foreseeability as components of proximate cause.

Further, the absence of expert testimony establishing a causal connection between the pneumonia and any impairment of memory was another key reason for the verdict. Dr. Packard's inability to affirm that her injuries were due to her hospitalization at Covenant meant there was no expert testimony to support a link between Donna's condition and the alleged medical negligence. The appellate court would agree with the trial court's findings that the Basingers did not demonstrate that any act or omission by Covenant Health System was the proximate cause necessary for a claim in medical negligence. As such, it will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment, ruling that the Basingers take nothing against Covenant.
