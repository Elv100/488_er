Background:
Cecilia Tix Smith was the insured party under an accident insurance policy issued by the appellee insurer, promising to pay $10,000.00 if her death resulted directly and independently from bodily injury caused by an accident while she was using an automobile. On December 11, 1959, Smith died from acute heart failure while in her car after an incident where her vehicle's back bumper locked with another car's bumper. This mishap required physical and emotional effort to disengage, including assistance from others. The appellant executor argued that her death was caused by the resultant bodily injuries from this accident.

Mrs. Smith was 66 and had a history of serious health issues, including a bad heart condition which meant she could die at any point from minimal exertion or stress, and cancer with continuing treatment effects impacting her lung and heart function. She took various medications for her heart and had previously been advised to acquire a car with power steering to reduce physical strain, which she had not done.

Dr. McLarty, her long-time physician, had treated her for both conditions and testified regarding both her health struggles leading up to the incident and the details of the event as the precipitating cause of her death. Dr. Thoma, who conducted the autopsy, agreed that her compromised cardiac status likely made the impact and exertion of the bumper incident sufficient to precipitate acute cardiac failure. 

The trial court concluded that the proximate cause of death was heart disease and not the accidental bodily injuries, citing that opinion testimony on causation was not binding and the death certificate did not mention an accident or injury causing death. The appellant executor argued on appeal that the death was accidental and directly caused by the bumper incident, independent of her heart disease.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the take-nothing judgment entered against the appellant executor, based on the standpoint that the proximate cause of the decedent's death was her pre-existing heart disease. While there was testimony from doctors that the stress and physical exertion from the car bumper incident was the precipitating cause of the cardiac failure, this is countered by evidence and opinion suggesting that Smith's severe heart condition was of such a nature that even minimal strain could be fatal. Hence, the incident can be viewed as merely the occasion of her death rather than its direct and independent cause.

Moreover, the court will likely note that Dr. McLarty's death certificate did not indicate exertion as the cause of death, which is prima facie evidence of the cause of death. Opinion evidence regarding causation, even when provided by medical experts, does not compel acceptance by the trier of fact, especially when other testimonial portions contradict or weaken the stance that the incident was the sole precipitating cause.

Given the policy's condition of liability contingent upon death resulting directly and independently from bodily injury due to an accident, the court will focus on determining the proximate cause of death. Considering the extent of pre-existing heart and lung conditions, the test will be whether the car incident and resulting exertion and stress were proximate or merely incidental to, or a remote cause of, the fatality.

It will be concluded that the evidence supports a finding that Smith's heart disease was the primary, proximate cause of death and that any injuries sustained during the bumper incident were incidental or at most aggravating factors to her pre-existing condition rather than direct causes. Thus, the insurer's obligation to pay under the policy will not arise, as the death did not result directly and independently from bodily injuries by an accident.
