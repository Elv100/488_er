Background:
Wilker Cheek went to the emergency room of the appellant hospital, Sisters of St. Joseph of Texas, Inc., on January 17, 1996, complaining of abdominal pain. He was admitted for evaluation and underwent an exploratory laparotomy performed by Dr. Job Buschman, which revealed acute appendicitis. On January 19th, an appendectomy was performed. Initially, Cheek's condition improved post-surgery, but then it deteriorated. He was moved to the intensive care unit on January 23rd and diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. Unfortunately, he passed away on January 25th. The appellees, who are the estate beneficiaries of Wilker Cheek, filed a lawsuit against the appellant hospital and Dr. Buschman, seeking actual and exemplary damages, alleging malice. Dr. Buschman settled during the trial, and thereafter, the jury found both Dr. Buschman and the hospital’s negligence proximately caused the death of Mr. Cheek, and that malice was involved on the part of the hospital. Consequently, the jury awarded exemplary damages against the hospital.

The appellant hospital cited sixteen issues, of which the second issue challenges the legal sufficiency of the appellees’ evidence regarding proximate cause of the negligence by the hospital. Specifically, the appellant questioned whether there was evidence to show that, to a reasonable medical probability, the alleged breaches by the hospital nurses were such that "but for" these breaches, Mr. Cheek would have survived, or whether these breaches were significant factors in causing Mr. Cheek’s death.

The expert for the appellees, Dr. Sparks Veasey, testified that Mr. Cheek’s death was caused by a pulmonary embolus which could be related to immobilization, but he gave no opinion on when the clot formed. His testimony stated the failures of the nurses to ambulate Mr. Cheek post-surgery, to recognize signs of pulmonary embolus timely, and to notify the doctor of Mr. Cheek’s emergency status “caused or contributed to” Mr. Cheek’s death. This led to discussions over whether these failures were significant, proximate causes of the death, particularly in light of the jury's instruction defining proximate cause in the context of hospital nurse conduct.

Verdict:
The verdict will be that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that the negligence of the hospital proximately caused the death of Mr. Cheek. The court will sustain the appellant's second issue due to the lack of evidence that satisfies the criteria for establishing proximate cause.

The reasoning will include a discussion about proximate cause, underlining that the cause must be both a substantial factor in bringing about the harm and also such that the harm would not have occurred without it. The evidence must show that the negligence probably resulted in the injury to meet the standard of reasonable medical probability.

Dr. Veasey's use of "caused or contributed to" will not meet the legal threshold as it fails to articulate whether the alleged negligence was a substantial factor or the harm would not have occurred without the alleged negligence. Since causation in medical negligence requires more than a possibility and Dr. Veasey did not attest that the absence of the alleged breaches of standard of care would have more likely than not prevented Mr. Cheek's death, his testimony cannot be the basis for establishing proximate cause.

The verdict will reverse the trial court's judgment and render that the appellees take nothing due to this legal insufficiency. The other sixteen issues presented by the appellant will not be addressed because the resolution of the second issue alone will be dispositive of the appeal.
