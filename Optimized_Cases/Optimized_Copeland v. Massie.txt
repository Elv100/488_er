Background:
The appellants, H. A. Copeland and wife Lois Copeland, initially filed a lawsuit against W. M. Massie after their son, H. A. Copeland, Jr., tragically drowned while swimming in an open pit on Massie's property. After Massie's death intestate on January 22, 1949, the appellants included Massie's surviving spouse, Lela M. Massie, and children, W. A. Massie and Geraldine Massie Murray, as party defendants. The trial court sustained the appellees' special exception, which contended that the appellants failed to plead a cause of action.

The appellants claimed the property owned by the Massies was a hazard, particularly to minors, due to the presence of a large, deep pit filled with muddy water, which was the result of caliche being removed from the property years prior. The pit, being visible from the surrounding residences, unpaved streets, and a paved highway, was known or should have been known to attract children for swimming. They argued that the Massies were aware that children frequented the pit for swimming or should have known this through the exercise of ordinary care. The appellants' son, a fourteen-year-old boy with no experience swimming in such conditions, did not appreciate the dangers of the pit and consequently drowned. Efforts to rescue and recover the boy were hampered by the pit's size, steep banks, and murky waters. The appellants cited the Massies' negligence in failing to prevent the pit from filling with water, not enclosing it with a fence, not putting up warning signs, and not constructing drainage to control water flow. The Massies, in their defense, argued that the deceased had age-appropriate understanding of the risks of swimming in the pit and that the "attractive nuisance doctrine" did not apply as he was presumed to be a trespasser who knowingly encountered the danger.

Verdict:
In predicting the outcome, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a trial on the merits. The court will likely find that the appellants did manage to allege a cause of action against the appellees. It will be determined that the appellants presented a fact question suitable for a jury or trial court to decide: whether a normal boy of the age, experience, capacity, intelligence, and understanding of the deceased had the discretion to recognize the dangers of swimming in the pit. The fact-finding body will consider the individual qualities of the deceased child as compared with other children of his age and all the circumstances surrounding the death, including any specific dangers related to swimming in the pit. The court will likely hold that the age of the child is an important factor but not solely determinative.

The court will reject the appellees' contention that the child was a trespasser and will refer to precedents indicating that when children are attracted to a premises by something alluring, it can amount to an implied invitation; this aligns with the attractive nuisance doctrine. The court will emphasize that the actual knowledge or duty of care that the Massies had or should have had concerning the pit's danger to children, along with the feasibility and minimal expense of remedying the dangerous condition, should have been assessed.

The court will likely apply existing legal principles, such as those found in Texas case law and delineated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง339, taking into account that the age and understanding of a child are critical factors in assessing potential liability. Neither the appellants' pleadings nor the appellees' arguments sufficiently resolve the factual questions related to the child's understanding of the risk and the Massies' negligence. Therefore, a trial on the merits will be necessary to ascertain the facts and apply the law accordingly.
