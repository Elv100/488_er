Background:
Appellant patient, Doris Penrod, appealed a take-nothing judgment entered in favor of appellee doctor, David R. Schecter, M.D., Individually, and d/b/a Schecter and Blumenfeld, P.A., following a jury trial on her medical malpractice claim.

The case stemmed from an eye injury Penrod sustained on August 6, 2003, when she was scheduled for cataract surgery on her left eye with Dr. Schecter. An anesthesiologist administered a retrobulbar injection of anesthesia, causing a small retrobulbar hemorrhage (RBH) in Penrod's eye. This is a rare complication, with an even smaller percentage posing a risk to the optic nerve. Dr. Schecter observed no change in the RBH and did not use a tonometer to measure intraocular pressure, choosing instead to cancel the surgery due to potential complications.

Penrod was discharged with instructions and returned the following morning experiencing bruising, no vision, and significant pain. Dr. Schecter diagnosed a rebleed and prescribed medications to lower intraocular pressure. Penrod did not improve and was later diagnosed with ischemic optic atrophy, which can be caused by RBH.

At trial, Penrod's expert witness contended that the standard of care required measurement of intraocular pressure and vision evaluation. Dr. Schecter's expert disagreed, asserting that the practice was to evaluate by clinical observation, which indicated no need for further immediate intervention.

During the charge conference at trial, there was an error introduced in the jury instructions concerning proximate cause: the inclusion of unrelated "new and independent cause" language. Penrod objected but was cut off by the court, and the mistake was carried into the jury's instructions. The jury found no negligence proximately causing the injury. Penrod filed a motion for a new trial based on this error, which was rejected by the trial court.

Verdict:
The court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial. Proximate cause instruction will be critically reassessed because the inclusion of "unbroken by any new and independent cause" was found by the appellate court to be erroneous and unsupported by evidence. There was no proof that Penrod's post-discharge rebleed was independent of the original alleged negligence. The jury should have been exclusively guided by the definition and relationship of direct causation regarding Dr. Schecter's actions.

The error will likely be considered harmful for appeal purposes, as it relates to a contested, critical issue—causation—and defense counsel's argument regarding the new and independent cause was one that could only have been made due to the defective proximate cause instruction. Furthermore, the appellate court will probably consider the introduction of the flawed language into the charge to constitute harmful error as it provided the jury with an inappropriate basis to find that the negligence of Dr. Schecter, if any, did not proximately cause Doris Penrod's injury.

The provision of a flawed instruction regarding proximate cause will be seen on appeal as misleading to the jury, allowing them to improperly consider factors outside the direct evidence and testimony presented. The error gave the appellant an unintended defensive argument that shifted the jury's focus from evaluating whether Dr. Schecter breached the standard of care directly causing the injury, to considering an unfounded 'new and independent cause.' Therefore, the jury's consideration of causation was based on a legally incorrect standard. As such, reversing and remanding for a new trial will be deemed necessary to ensure a verdict based on a correct understanding and application of the law to the facts presented, which could provide the appellant with a fair reevaluation of the evidence in light of properly articulated legal standards.
