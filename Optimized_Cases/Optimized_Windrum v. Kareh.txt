Background: 

Lance Windrum, a 46-year-old man, experienced a disorienting episode in a parking lot on February 3, 2010, which included slurred speech and confusion. He also hit his head while getting into his car. An ambulance took him to North Cypress Medical Center (NCMC), where he underwent a CT scan and MRI, which led to a referral to Dr. Harpaul Gill, a neurologist at NCMC. Lance tested positive for Benzodiazepines. Lance reported three similar episodes in recent months, albeit milder ones. Additionally, he had a history of encephalitis as a child.

Dr. Gill diagnosed Lance with compensated obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis and referred Lance to Dr. Victor Kareh, a neurosurgeon, for further treatment, asserting that a shunt was required. Dr. Kareh evaluated Lance but did not review his medical history thoroughly. Lance was not experiencing symptoms at the time Dr. Kareh saw him. Instead of inserting a shunt, Dr. Kareh placed a ventricular drain to monitor intracranial pressure for 24 hours. Monitoring showed no immediate abnormal pressure, so no shunt was installed, although Dr. Kareh anticipated a future need for one.

Lance had another episode on February 15, 2010, and further MRI and EEG testing in April 2010 showed worsening aqueductal stenosis. However, these results, nor the symptoms from the most recent episode, were communicated to Dr. Kareh. Lance died in his sleep on May 2, 2010. An autopsy by Dr. Morna Gonsoulin found hydrocephalus complications caused by aqueductal stenosis as the cause of death.

Tracy Windrum, Lance's wife, filed a negligence suit against Dr. Kareh, claiming that his failure to install a shunt caused Lance's death. The jury found Dr. Gill and Dr. Kareh negligent, assigning 20 and 80 percent fault, respectively, and awarded significant damages to Windrum and her minor children. The trial court upheld the jury's verdict and awards. 

Dr. Kareh appealed, challenging both the breach of standard of care's legal and factual sufficiency and causation leading to Lance's death. The appellate court concluded plaintiff's expert's testimony was conclusory and the negligence too remote to constitute proximate cause. Thus, the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment. The plaintiff petitioned for review in the Texas Supreme Court.

Verdict:

The expert testimony will be deemed not conclusory. The jury will be deemed to have had the authority to determine the persuasiveness of Dr. Parrish's expert opinion over other experts, considering the extensive evidence from Lance's medical records, Dr. Parrish's own experience with hydrocephalus patients, and the testimony of both Dr. Dragovic and Dr. Kareh which supported the presence of hydrocephalus. There will be no expectation that every aspect of Dr. Parrish's conclusion be supported by medical literature, as the combination of his expertise, Lance's medical history, and the observations of Lance's symptoms will provide a sufficient basis for the opinion. The foreseeability and substantial factor tests will support a determination that a neurosurgeon presented with such symptoms and MRI results would have known to insert a shunt. 

As for proximate cause, the jury will be found to have sufficient grounds to determine that Dr. Kareh's negligence, in failing to treat the obstructive hydrocephalus properly, was a substantial factor in Lance Windrum's death. The direct causal link between Dr. Kareh's breach of duty in not installing a shunt and Lance's death by obstructive hydrocephalus will be established to a reasonable medical probability. Assertions that the negligence was not the "immediate cause" will be rejected, as Texas law recognizes that a negligent act need not be the sole cause of an injury, just a substantial factor. 

Finally, the appellate court will be found to have erred in its application of the standard for factual sufficiency review. Although it recited the correct standard, the court of appeals failed to detail the evidence and explain why the jury's verdict was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence or manifestly unjust. Therefore, a remand will be required for the appellate court to apply the factual sufficiency standard correctly or to determine if the plaintiff presented legally and factually sufficient testimony to support the jury's verdict, in accordance with the guidance provided.
