Background:
Appellants in this case are individuals and the personal representative of Jeronimo Carrasco's estate who initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Tri City Community Hospital ("Hospital") following Carrasco's death. The lawsuit alleged that the Hospital failed to properly record Carrasco's complaints and did not report the results from his x-ray in a timely manner, which they claimed resulted in his death.

On April 20, 1995, Carrasco was taken to the Hospital's emergency room by ambulance, complaining of back pain. He was admitted, observed, but then released on April 21, still experiencing back pain. On April 22, he was unable to stand and complained of not having had a bowel movement for four days. An x-ray taken that day showed a significantly widened mediastinum and an increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette, prompting a recommendation to consider the possibility of an aortic dissection.

By April 24, Carrasco's condition had deteriorated, leading to his airlift to Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, where a CT scan revealed a type I dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Emergency surgery was performed to replace the ascending aorta with a synthetic graft. Despite the surgery, Carrasco developed a pericardial effusion with tamponade the next day, and after another round of emergency surgery, he passed away.

In response to the lawsuit, the Hospital moved for a no-evidence summary judgment, essentially arguing that there was no evidence to support the claim that the Hospital's actions were the proximate cause of Carrasco's death. The trial court granted the Hospital's motion, prompting the appeal.

The appeal court found that the Hospital was asserting that the appellants failed to present any evidence of proximate cause, which led to the initial summary judgment. Despite appellants' failure to file deposition testimony as per the rules, they attached two affidavits from Dr. Comer Roger Youmans, Jr., M.D., and the Hospital's medical records to their response, which the trial court could consider. Dr. Youmans stated that timely diagnosis and treatment of the dissecting aneurysm would have significantly improved Carrasco's chances of survival, arguing that the Hospital had a duty to convey the abnormal x-ray results to attending physicians urgently. The medical records and Dr. Youmans' affidavits were deemed sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause element of the case, which the trial court was accused of ignoring.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's ruling that granted the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of the Hospital. They will find that the affidavits from Dr. Youmans, coupled with the medical records, provide more than a scintilla of evidence, suggesting a genuine issue of material fact regarding the proximate cause element of the malpractice action. The affidavits assert a credible link between the alleged malpractice and the harm suffered, in that a timely intervention based on the x-ray results could have potentially led to a different outcome for Carrasco. It will be emphasized that failing to convey the results of the x-ray on the day of admission may have deprived Carrasco of the opportunity for elective surgery, which has statistically higher survival rates than emergency surgery following an aortic dissection rupture. Consequently, the appellate court will conclude that the Hospital's failure to ensure the x-ray results were reported to the attending physician on the day of admission may have been a proximate cause of Carrasco's subsequent injuries and untimely death. They will find that the trial court erred in granting the no-evidence summary judgment, and the case will be remanded for a trial where these issues can be fully explored before a jury.
