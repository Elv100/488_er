Background:
Appellant Thurman McKinney filed a wrongful death action against appellee Air Venture Corporation after his wife, Virginia McKinney, died in an air crash on June 8, 1974. Virginia was one of the six passengers killed when a 1973 Piper Aztec, owned by Air Venture, crashed near Cresson, Texas, during a storm while returning to Meacham Field in Fort Worth from a business trip in Lubbock. The aircraft was caught in turbulence created by a wind shear, resulting from severe thunderstorms in the area. It was established that the crash occurred when the aircraft encountered turbulence due to the wind shear.

The jury returned negative findings on the negligence issues, finding that the pilot, John Dittmaier, was not negligent despite flying into intense thunderstorm activity and failing to divert to another airport. Although it found the pilot was acting as an employee of Air Venture and that $147,225.00 would fairly compensate McKinney for his wife’s death, the judgment ruled that McKinney would "take nothing."

On appeal, McKinney challenged the jury's verdict, contending that the findings were against the weight of the evidence and that the pilot was negligent. The evidence included expert testimony from six experts, including pilots and meteorologists, mostly establishing that the pilot was negligent for flying into the thunderstorm and failing to divert. Additional facts underscored the pilot received multiple warnings from various flight services outlining severe weather conditions, including the possibility of hail, high winds, and cloud tops up to 59,000 feet. The evidence showed the pilot acknowledged these warnings but continued toward the planned destination.

The jury findings included that the flight was part of a joint enterprise between Air Venture and A.V. Corpening, Jr. (doing business as Corpening Enterprises), the pilot was a borrowed employee of Air Venture on that occasion, and the pilot was then acting as an employee of Air Venture.

Procedurally, at the close of the evidence, McKinney dismissed Corpening Enterprises and the Corpening estate as defendants, abandoning his claim for exemplary damages. He also filed motions arguing against the jury findings and asking for a new trial.

Verdict:
Upon reviewing the extensive evidence and the expert testimonies, it will likely be predicted that the court would reverse the lower court's ruling that McKinney takes nothing in his wrongful death suit. The appeals court would find that the jury's verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, which indicated that the pilot was negligent in choosing to continue flight toward the destination despite warnings of severe weather conditions, including specific advisories about the intense thunderstorm activity and significant meteorological phenomena like wind shear.

The court would likely hold that flying an airplane, especially under such weather conditions, is beyond the realm of ordinary jurors without expert testimony, and this expert testimony established that the pilot did not exercise the proper level of care expected from someone in his position. The testimony from experienced pilots, who concluded the pilot was negligent, was not sufficiently countered with concrete evidence to the contrary that could have justified the pilot’s actions. The court would predict that the evidence showed the pilot made a conscious choice to risk flying towards severe weather, despite adequate warnings and alternate safe options to divert the flight.

Moreover, Air Venture Corporation, as the owner of the plane and the employer of the pilot, would likely be held responsible under respondeat superior for the actions of their employee in this circumstance. With the pilot exercising control over the flight and not abiding by safe navigational decisions, Air Venture would be liable for the consequences of those decisions.

Additionally, the court would likely reject Air Venture's claim of immunity under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act. Based on the specifics of the case, including the relationship between the pilot, Air Venture, and Corpening Enterprises, it would be likely ruled that Air Venture was not an agent of Virginia McKinney's employer for purposes of the Act and thus not immune from the wrongful death action.

The court would express that the verdict was manifestly unjust and against the interests of justice and, consequently, reverse and remand for a new trial where McKinney's claims could be reassessed. The court would also likely conclude that the evidence suggested that if the pilot had adhered to the information and exercised the caution that a reasonable and prudent pilot would under the same weather conditions, the tragic accident could have been avoided.
