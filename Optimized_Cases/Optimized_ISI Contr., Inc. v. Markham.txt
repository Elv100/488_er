Background:
In February 2015, Joslyn Markham, an eighteen-year-old, was fatally injured, and her older sister Naomi was seriously hurt when their pickup truck veered onto the shoulder of Highway 281 past Jones Maltsberger road, hit a guardrail, and fell approximately forty feet, landing inverted. The family, including Naomi, her parents Carrie and Trevor Markham, and Trevor Markham as the administrator of Joslyn's estate (collectively the Markhams), sued the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) for premises defect; ISI Contracting, Inc. for negligence and negligent undertaking; ISI and Guerra Construction for breach of contract (under a third-party beneficiary status); and all defendants for "concerted wrongful conduct."

The Markhams claimed that the guardrail had been damaged months earlier and was repaired by ISI and Guerra Construction, who replaced the guardrail at a height lower than TxDOT's standards, causing the fatal accident. Both ISI and Guerra moved for summary judgment, invoking an affirmative defense under section 97.002, arguing they were immune from liability as they complied with their contract documents as highway repair contractors.

The trial court denied the motions for summary judgment, leading to ISI and Guerra's interlocutory appeal. ISI argued they were entitled to summary judgment against all the Markhams' claims, based on their affirmative defense under section 97.002. Additionally, they claimed they were entitled to summary judgment against the Markhams' breach of contract claims as third-party beneficiaries because the contracts expressly excluded third-party beneficiaries. Guerra joined ISI's first two issues and asserted that concert of action was not a valid cause of action in this case.

The appellate court considered whether ISI and Guerra's work on the guardrail constituted ‘repairs,’ whether the guardrail was part of a 'highway,' and whether the contractors complied with contract documents material to the guardrail repair. The court held that ISI and Guerra’s work did constitute ‘repairs’ to the highway and that the guardrail was part of the highway. Also, the court found that the contractors had complied with the contract documents as their work was approved by a TxDOT Engineer whose decisions regarding the work performed and compliance with contract documents were final and binding.

Verdict:
The court will predict that ISI and Guerra are immune from liability because they are highway repair contractors who complied with their contract documents, as delineated in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem Code Ann. § 97.002. Despite the actual height of the guardrail being below TxDOT's standard level, it is not material given the Engineer's approval of the work. Given the court's interpretation of section 97.002, the statute's liability shield applies to the contractors, shielding them from all claims, both tort and contract. Consequently, the court will find that ISI and Guerra are entitled to summary judgment against the Markhams' third-party beneficiary and concert of action claims, primarily based on the statutory immunity provision.

The summary judgment evidence will clearly establish that the contractors met all requirements for the statutory affirmative defense to apply. These elements include that ISI and Guerra were contractors who repaired part of a highway for TxDOT and that they were in compliance with the contract documents material to the condition or defect that allegedly caused personal injury and death. The court's application of the statutory defense will dictate that the contractors' compliance with the pertinent contract documents is confirmed through the Engineer’s approval of the work. Therefore, the trial court's error in denying the motions for summary judgment will be reversed, and the court will render a judgment dismissing all the Markhams' claims against ISI and Guerra.
