Background:
On April 4, 1992, Manuel Carrasco, who was seventeen years old, and James Gabriel, whose age is not specified, purchased CCI .22 long rifle mini-mag bullets from a Kmart store. Carrasco and Gabriel took the ammunition and a .22 caliber pistol they had acquired from Carrasco's younger brother and engaged in target shooting. Later, as they drove with friends, including Leonard Bell, they picked up beer, drove to the countryside to drink, and returned to a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant. That evening, in the town of Denison, they engaged in "cruising" and seeking a fight. During an encounter with Richard Cowart, Bell managed to get hold of the loaded pistol and, not knowing it was loaded, shot and killed Richard Cowart.

Legal actions ensued with criminal charges leading to convictions for involuntary manslaughter against both Bell and Carrasco. Subsequently, the Cowarts, Richard's parents, filed a civil suit against Carrasco, Gabriel, and Kmart. Their claim against Kmart was based on its alleged negligence in selling ammunition to minors. Kmart moved for summary judgment, claiming that the shooting was not foreseeable and that the shooter's conduct constituted an intervening and superseding cause of death, negating Kmart's liability. The trial court granted Kmart's motion for summary judgment.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Kmart, concluding that Kmart's sale of ammunition to Carrasco and Gabriel could not be considered the proximate cause of Richard Cowart's death. Kmart's defense will successfully argue that the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the sale, primarily because one would expect a seventeen-year-old to have the capability to appreciate the risks associated with handling ammunition responsibly. Moreover, the court will find that the chain of events leading to the shooting was highly extraordinary, further obstructing a direct link between Kmart's actions and the fatal incident.

The court is likely to examine the legal concept of foreseeability and the nature of superseding causes as delineated by the Restatement (Second) of Torts. In addition to the foreseeability, the court will consider if the intervening act of Bell, who was not sold the ammunition directly and acted independently from Kmart's sale, brought about a different kind of harm than what the initial act could have produced. The court may also consider that Bell's criminal act, a key point, would effectively shield Kmart from liability as Kmart could not have anticipated that its sale of ammunition to Carrasco and Gabriel could culminate in such a criminal act by Bell.

The court will likely underscore the significance of the six Restatement factors in establishing Bellâ€™s act as a superseding cause. It will conclude that the Cowarts have failed to provide adequate evidentiary support for their claim that Kmart could have foreseen the criminal application of the bullets by Bell. Consequently, the court will determine that no factual issue exists regarding the foreseeability element necessary for negligence, leading to upholding the summary judgment for Kmart.
