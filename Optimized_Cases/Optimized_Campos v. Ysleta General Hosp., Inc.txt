Background:
The deceased child's parents, appellants Jose and Florencia Campos, brought a lawsuit against Ysleta General Hospital, Inc., Pedro Ortega, and Centro Medico Del Valle (the appellees) claiming negligence and intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress following the death of their five-year-old son. The mother, Mrs. Campos, had sought medical treatment for her ill son Jose, first at Ysleta General Hospital where she was turned away because she couldn't prove she could pay for the medical expenses. Then at Centro Medico Del Valle, a community health clinic, she was told to fill out paperwork and wait for an available room; perceiving this as another payment impediment, she decided to take her son to another hospital. After being admitted to the emergency room at R.E. Thomason General Hospital, the child was pronounced dead due to respiratory arrest caused by cerebral edema.

In the trial, the appellants claimed the refusal by the appellees to provide prompt medical attention resulted in negligence and the infliction of emotional distress. The trial court, however, granted a directed verdict in favor of the appellees, which led the appellants to seek further review. The appellants contended that there was sufficient evidence to raise material facts related to each cause of action and that the trial court erred in excluding certain testimony. During the appeal, the court had to review whether there was any evidence of probative force that established the appellees' actions proximately caused the death and whether the appellants' emotional distress was a result thereof. The physicians' testimonies indicated possibilities but did not confirm a causal connection based on reasonable medical probability, thus failing to support proximate cause.

Verdict:
The court would affirm the directed verdict because the evidence presented by the appellants does not prove with sufficient probative force that the actions of the appellees proximately caused the death of the child. It would be noted that proximate cause requires both foreseeability and cause-in-fact, with cause-in-fact needing a substantial factor in bringing about the injury which would not have occurred otherwise. In this case, the cause-in-fact is not established because the medical testimonies only suggest a possibility, not a probability, that earlier treatment could have saved the child, thus constituting mere speculation that is insufficient for establishing a causal link. 

For the emotional distress claims, the appellants would be required to show that appellees acted intentionally or recklessly, and that such conduct was extreme and outrageous, directly causing severe emotional distress to appellants. However, the court would deem that any emotional distress suffered by the appellants arose from the death of their son, rather than from any proven actions of the appellees. Since cause and severe emotional distress could not be satisfactorily proven to be directly attributable to appellees' actions, the claims for both negligence and infliction of emotional distress would not hold, and the verdict in favor of the appellees would be affirmed.
