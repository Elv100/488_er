Background:
Keys & Casey, property owners and partners, filed a lawsuit against the Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Company (Telephone Company) and the Belton & Temple Traction Company (Traction Company) to recover $400 in damages for the loss of their two horses. The horses were alleged to have been killed on March 16, 1906, while on Pearl Street in the city of Belton, Texas. The horses came into contact with a wire from the Telephone Company that had fallen across a trolley wire of the Traction Company and into the street. A jury trial in the County Court of Bell County resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs, Keys & Casey, awarding them $200 from both defendants.

The Telephone Company and the Traction Company appealed, arguing that the court should have followed their request to instruct the jury that the incident was caused by an inevitable accident or act of God, in which case the jury should find in favor of the defendants. The appellants contended that the court should have set aside the jury's verdict and granted a new trial. They presented evidence suggesting that the wire was in good condition before the accident and that the cause of it falling was a severe storm with hail, wind, lightning, and heavy rain. The Telephone Company detailed that a heavy storm that night led to one of its properly maintained wires being struck by lightning and falling, an act of God over which they had no control.

The property owners maintained that the defendants had been negligent in their duties to maintain and insulate the wires and guard where their wires crossed, leading to the accident. They argued that the evidence from the trial sufficiently supported the jury's verdict and the court's judgment.

The defense claimed that there was no concurring negligence between the two companies, as the accident resulted from the wire being struck by lightning, which they could not have prevented. Furthermore, they argued that the wires were made from high-quality materials and were in good condition, thus the accident was an act of God.

Verdict:
The court reversed the judgment in favor of the property owners and rendered judgment in favor of the Telephone Company and the Traction Company. The reasoning for this outcome was based on the conclusion that the wire falling and resulting in the death of the horses was an unavoidable accident caused by an act of God, specifically the severe storm and lightning on the night in question. The court believed that the evidence showed that the striking of the telephone wire by lightning was the proximate cause of the horses' deaths. The court found that there was no evidence of concurrent negligence on the part of the Telephone Company for failing to insulate its wires or on the part of the Traction Company for failing to maintain guard wires. The lack of a causal link between the alleged negligence and the accident led the court to determine that the peremptory instruction – which would have directed the jury to find for the defendants – should have been given. Consequently, any negligence, such as maintaining weak, dangerous, or rusted wires as alleged by the property owners, did not contribute to the incident, and thus the companies were not liable for the deaths of the horses. Given the verdict was based on the ruling that the accident was caused by an act of God and there was no evidence supporting concurring negligence by the defendants, the court reversed and rendered the judgment in favor of the appellants.
