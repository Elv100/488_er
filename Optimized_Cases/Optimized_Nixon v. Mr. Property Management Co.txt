Background:
R.M.V., a 10-year-old child, was abducted on August 7, 1981, at around 7:00 p.m. from the sidewalk outside the Landmark Apartments where she resided. She was forcibly taken across the street to the Chalmette Apartments, which are diagonally situated, and raped in a vacant unit of this apartment complex. It was noted that the door of the vacant apartment was off its hinges, and the windows lacked panes, making the unit easily accessible and unsuitable for preventing unauthorized entry. The apartment complex's dilapidated state was a violation of the Dallas City Ordinance requiring doors and windows of vacant structures to be secured to prohibit unauthorized entry.

Gaile Nixon, mother and legal guardian of R.M.V., subsequently filed a lawsuit against multiple parties, including the owners and managers of both the Chalmette and Landmark Apartments. Nixon settled the case with the interests of Landmark Apartments and focused the lawsuit on the owner (Brett Davis) and manager (Mr. Property Management Company) of Chalmette Apartments, collectively referred to as Mr. Property. Nixon's action asserted that Mr. Property owed R.M.V. a duty of reasonable care, which was breached, and that this breach was a proximate cause of the rape. The traumatic event was characterized as reasonably foreseeable due to the history of prior violent activities, burglaries, and other crimes at the complex, as well as vagrants known to frequent the area.

The trial court ruled in favor of Mr. Property by granting a summary judgment, and the appeals court upheld this judgment. The plaintiff then brought the case to a higher court for review.

Verdict:
The higher court reversed the decisions of both the trial and appeals courts and remanded the cause for trial on the merits. The ruling is based on the existence of genuine issues of fact regarding Mr. Property's alleged breach of duty and whether their negligence proximately caused the child's injuries.

In determining Mr. Property's negligence per se, the court will consider whether the violation of the city ordinance, which was intended to deter criminal activity by eliminating obvious opportunities for criminal conduct, was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury (cause in fact). The evidence suggests that the assailant was aware of the vacant apartment and that he specifically chose it knowing it was an accessible location for the assault, implying it was not secured as required.

Moreover, in evaluating foreseeability, the court will consider that a reasonable person, in Mr. Property's position, should have anticipated the danger their negligent act created for others. Given the history of prior violent crimes at the Chalmette Apartments, additional violent acts would be considered reasonably foreseeable. Even the absence of evidence of prior rapes does not deter this finding as foreseeability does not require that the precise nature of the accident be predicted, but only that the general character of the accident could reasonably have been expected.

The evidence of the property's state and the significant record of crime, combined with testimony on the motivation behind securing vacant apartments, leads to the reasonable inference that improved security could have deterred R.M.V.'s assailant or others like him. The court recognizes that the presence of prior crimes similar in nature to the one endured by R.M.V. contributes to a foreseeability analysis, thereby creating a legitimate issue for a jury's consideration.

Therefore, the summary judgment was inappropriate given the unresolved material facts related to duty, breach, and proximate cause. The court remands the case to the trial court, stipulating that it should proceed to a trial on the merits where these issues can be fully examined.
