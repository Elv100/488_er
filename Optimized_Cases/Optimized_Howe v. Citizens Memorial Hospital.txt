Background:
Plaintiffs Ward Howe and his wife Estelle Howe filed a personal injury action against the defendants, which included the County of Victoria, Texas, Citizens Memorial Hospital of Victoria County, Texas, and doctors Dr. George A. Constant and Dr. F. S. Ted Shields. The case related to injuries Mrs. Howe sustained after falling from her bed in the psychiatric ward of the hospital, two hours post receiving an electrical shock treatment (glissando therapy). The treatment was administered by Dr. Shields and a team of nurses and attendants.

The Howes alleged specific acts of negligence on the part of Dr. Shields which they argued led to Mrs. Howe's fall and subsequent injuries. They contended he failed to properly supervise the application of the glissando sheet used for restraining the patient after the shock treatment, did not return to inspect the sheet, and failed to instruct the attendants and nurses to apply restraining bedboards or bed rails. The plaintiffs also alleged negligence against the hospital but encountered a defense of governmental immunity.

During the trial, motions for instructed verdict were filed by the defendants, resulting in a take-nothing judgment by the trial court in favor of the defendants. While the hospital and county invoked their governmental immunity, the doctors contended that there was a failure to prove actionable negligence and lack of evidence supporting a special servant relationship between the doctors and hospital employees.

The trial court agreed with the defenses, and the plaintiffs appealed. The evidence presented and testimony from medical professionals indicated that the restraints used were not foolproof, patients were known to escape them, and the use of bed rails was considered advisable by expert witnesses. Dr. Shields had left after the procedure without ensuring appropriate restraint had been applied.

The hospital and county argued that as governmental agencies, they were immune from tort liability. They also noted that the hospital was legally authorized to accept Mrs. Howe as a paying patient despite her being from a different county, with the factual matters pointing to the established process, organization, and legal underpinnings identifying the hospital as a governmental entity.
