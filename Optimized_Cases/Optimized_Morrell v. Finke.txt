Background: On December 31, 1994, at Arlington Memorial Hospital, Donna Morrell gave birth to her daughter, Madeline, who suffered permanent neurological injuries that were allegedly proximately caused by the negligence of the defendants: Dr. Mary Angeline Finke, Obstetrical & Gynecological Associates of Arlington (the clinic), nurses Rose Fenton R.N.C., Sandy Stephens R.N., and Marianne Walker R.N., and Arlington Memorial Hospital Foundation, Inc. (the hospital). The parents claimed that Madeline's injuries resulted from complications during labor and delivery due to failure to perform a timely cesarean section and the forceps delivery method used. The jury found that all defendants' negligence was a proximate cause of the child's injuries and awarded damages to the parents, Madeline, and for medical expenses. However, the trial court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) regarding the parents' damages for mental anguish and loss of consortium.

Verdict: The court modified the judgment from the trial court to delete the imposition of joint liability on Nurse Fenton, as she had been found 5 percent proportionately responsible and under Texas law, such a finding did not permit joint liability. The parents' claim for their child's medical expenses belonged solely to them and had a two-year statute of limitations under Texas law. Thus, the claims against the nurses were time-barred, and the judgment on that ground should have been granted by the trial court. The evidence presented was sufficient to support the finding that Dr. Finke's negligence, in not performing a cesarean section when the baby's distress signs during labor were evident, was a proximate cause of the permanent injuries to the child. Similarly, the nurses' breaches of duty were substantial influencing factors that, had they not occurred, would have likely prevented the injuries sustained by Madeline. As for damages awarded for past and future medical expenses, based on the testimony provided and the documentation of past treatments, the amounts granted by the jury were factually supported and did not require any adjustment or remittitur. Hence, the court affirmed the rest of the judgment, including the JNOV concerning the parents' claims for mental anguish and loss of consortium, but reversed the imposition of liability on all nurses for the child's past medical expenses, rendering judgment that the parents take nothing from the nurses on that claim.
