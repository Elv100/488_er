Background:
The appellant, a patient, sued the appellees, a hospital (Doctor's Hospital--Dallas) and a physician (Dr. Donald Dubrow), for medical malpractice. The patient was hospitalized for a bladder infection on February 19, 1991, and was treated by Dr. Dubrow, a licensed physician specializing in internal medicine with whom the appellant had a history of medical interaction. Both the hospital and Dr. Dubrow were aware that the appellant was allergic to penicillin. Despite this, Mefoxin—a drug contraindicated for penicillin-allergic patients—was prescribed by Dr. Dubrow and administered by the hospital. The appellant alleges this led to prolonged illness, additional medical issues, and a jeopardized life. Discharged on February 24, the appellant later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence and gross negligence against Dr. Dubrow and argued that any such acts were attributable to the hospital under respondeat superior.

In response to the lawsuit, both the hospital and Dr. Dubrow filed motions for summary judgment, asserting lack of negligence and absence of proximate causation of any injuries. Dr. Dubrow supported his motion with his own affidavit, while the hospital also relied on the same affidavit for their motion. The appellant countered with a response claiming the existence of material fact issues concerning Dr. Dubrow's breach of the standard of care and the hospital's liability due to Dr. Dubrow being a member of its staff. This response included affidavits from the appellant and Dr. Neal Stout. Before the summary judgment hearing, Dr. Dubrow requested to strike the appellant's response and attached evidence as untimely, which was granted by the trial court, thus leaving the appellant without any evidence to create a material fact issue regarding the standard of care or proximate causation.

Verdict:
The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees based on rule 166a(c) requirements and legal principles governing medical malpractice actions. The court will determine that Dr. Dubrow's affidavit met the criteria established in Duncan v. Horning, in which a defendant physician's affidavit could establish entitlement to summary judgment if it properly negates the elements of a malpractice claim—namely, that the physician complied with the standard of care and that no dereliction caused injury to the patient. Since Dr. Dubrow's affidavit adhered to these requirements, it successfully negated essential elements of the appellant's cause of action, particularly standard of care and proximate causation, thereby justifying summary judgment in his favor.

Regarding the appellant's response to the summary judgment, the court will find that the trial court was correct to strike it because it did not present any genuine issues of material fact, either because the evidence was stricken and thus not considered or, even if considered, it was insufficient. The appellant's own affidavit will be deemed inadequate to raise such issues because lay witness testimony on proximate cause is not considered probative in medical malpractice cases. Furthermore, Dr. Stout's affidavit will be found lacking any assertion of a causal connection between Dr. Dubrow's actions and the appellant's injuries. Without any established causal link, the claim against Dr. Dubrow fails, which in turn means that the hospital cannot be vicariously liable under respondeat superior.

The trial court's judgment will thus be affirmed since no factual issues were raised that could preclude summary judgment, and the evidentiary support for the appellant's claims was insufficient to meet the burden of proof required to survive a summary judgment motion.
