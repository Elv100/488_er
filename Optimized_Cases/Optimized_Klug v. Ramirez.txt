Background:
On February 9, 1984, 15-year-old Lisa L. Ramirez began experiencing severe abdominal pain. The following day, her parents took her to Valley Children's Center in Harlingen, Texas. Dr. William Grimes diagnosed her with gastroenteritis and sent her home with medication. However, Lisa's condition worsened, and she was taken back to the hospital at around 12:30 a.m. on February 11, where Dr. Grimes suspected appendicitis and contacted Dr. Thomas J. Klug, a general surgeon, around 1:00 a.m.

Dr. Klug decided to wait until Lisa was no longer dehydrated to perform surgery, which was eventually done at 10:45 a.m. The operation revealed a ruptured appendix and peritonitis. Lisa was discharged on February 18 but readmitted on February 22 due to suspected complications. Dr. Klug performed a second operation the next day, finding and draining an abdominal abscess. Lisa was discharged on March 2 and last seen by Dr. Klug on March 7, failing to show up for a follow-up on March 9.

The Ramirezes filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Klug, alleging negligence in diagnosis, medication administration, surgical treatment timing, and discharge from the hospital. Specifically, they contended Dr. Klug's premature discharge without appropriate tests caused Lisa ongoing menstrual pain, pelvic adhesions, and potential sterility. The jury found Dr. Klug negligent, and damages were awarded. Dr. Klug appealed, challenging the sufficiency of evidence on negligence and proximate cause.

The Ramirezes' medical expert, Dr. Martinez, testified to the standard of care, criticizing Dr. Klug's decision to discharge Lisa with persistent fever and infection without further evaluation. However, Dr. Martinez did not establish a direct causation between her discharge and the claimed damages of menstrual pain and potential sterility.

Verdict:
The appellate court decided that Dr. Klug's actions were not the proximate cause of Lisa's claimed damages. Although Dr. Martinez's testimony provided some evidence of negligence in the standard of care by discharging Lisa with a fever, there was no evidence demonstrating how this negligence directly led to Lisa's adhesions or scarring, or that further testing would likely have prevented her long-term complications.

Since proximate cause is a vital element in a medical malpractice case, requiring proof that the alleged negligence led directly and foreseeably to the injury, the absence of evidence connecting Dr. Klug's decision to the specific injuries Lisa experienced mandated granting an instructed verdict in his favor. Consequently, the appellate court overturned the trial court's ruling against Dr. Klug, sustaining his third point of error regarding insufficient evidence of proximate cause and overruling the second point on negligence. The case concludes with the court rendering judgment that the Ramirezes take nothing in their malpractice action against Dr. Klug, due to the failure to prove the proximate cause aspect of their claims.
