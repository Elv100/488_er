Background:
The case involves a lawsuit filed by Clyde Dalrymple and his wife Edith Dalrymple, as parents and legal representatives of their deceased minor son, Danny Dalrymple. They sued Parking, Inc., along with Zaragosa Amusement Company and the City of San Antonio, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries leading to the death of their son Danny. The incident occurred when Danny, accompanied by his uncle B.J. Dalrymple, fell into San Pedro Creek adjacent to a public parking lot operated by Parking, Inc., in San Antonio, Texas, where they had intended to go to the nearby Alameda Theatre.

The parking lot, owned by Zaragosa Amusement Company, was leased to Parking, Inc., which did not construct any fences or barriers along the property line bordering the creek. The parking lot layout involved cars parking with rear wheels backed up to the ground-placed telephone poles, and some of the cars extended over the open creek bed. There were no designated pedestrian exits from the parking lot. On the day of the incident, a heavy rain obscured visibility, and there was no warning provided about the potential hazard of the creek.

Danny and his uncle B.J. had parked in the lot, and while running to the theatre, both fell into what appeared to be a walkway but was the creek. B.J. managed to survive, and rescuers later found Danny's body downstream. B.J. recounted the events to various individuals before dying in an unrelated truck accident, but his statements were not recorded or formally documented since his deposition was never taken. The uncle's accounts were considered hearsay and presented a central issue at trial.

The Dalrymples alleged that Parking, Inc., was negligent for failing to install protective barriers or provide warnings about the creek's hazardous conditions. The trial court admitted B.J.'s hearsay statements and entered a judgment in the Dalrymples' favor. The judgment awarded damages for funeral expenses, loss suffered by the parents, and pain and mental anguish suffered by Danny. Parking, Inc. appealed, challenging the judgment and the admission of hearsay evidence, among other claims.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment favoring the Dalrymples and remand for a new trial. The reversal will be based on the trial court's error in admitting the hearsay statements made by B.J. Dalrymple as res gestae, which did not meet the criteria for admissibility and were prejudicial to Parking, Inc., as they primarily established that Danny fell from the parking lot premises.

In the new trial, the court will likely find a possibility to properly lay a sufficient predicate for the admission of some of B.J.'s statements, which could potentially be admissible as part of res gestae if made under specific circumstances that suggest spontaneity and direct relation to the occurrence.

Parking, Inc.'s assertion that the accident was not foreseeable as a matter of law will be rejected based on the general principles that an invitee of a parking lot includes those accompanying the primary invitee and that the parking lot owner owed a duty to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. As such, the owner is expected to protect invitees from foreseeable dangers, and to inspect to discover those conditions.

The parking lot's history of no prior incidents of visitors falling into the creek and the heavy rainfall alone will not relieve Parking, Inc. of liability, as it was still a foreseeable circumstance that heavy rain could occur, and that obscured visibility could lead to an invitee falling into the creek. The jury's rejection of the defense's position regarding a new and intervening cause and unavoidable accident will be seen as having a basis in evidence.

Ultimately, the appellate court will anticipate that upon a retrial, there could be evidence presented that supports the notion that Parking, Inc. could reasonably foresee someone falling into the obscured creek and thus had a duty either to erect a barrier or provide a warning about the hazard.
