Background:
The case involves appellant Border State Life Insurance Company and appellee Christine Noble regarding a policy of life insurance issued by the appellant on the life of the appellee's husband, Albert W. Noble, where the appellee was named as the beneficiary. Upon Mr. Noble's death, Mrs. Noble brought suit against the insurance company for the payment of life insurance proceeds.

The insurance company argued that the policy had lapsed due to the non-payment of an assessment premium due on August 5, 1937, and even though it was reinstated, Mr. Noble's coverage was limited by a "good health" clause which required him to be in good health upon reinstatement and not die from certain causes within one year of reinstatement. The company alleged they had mailed a notice of the assessment to Mr. Noble on July 20, 1937, but the payment was not made by August 5th, prompting a lapse in the policy.

However, Mrs. Noble claimed that her husband had not received the notice until August 9, 1937, to which he responded promptly. The policy on Mrs. Noble's life was similarly paid and accepted without any need for reinstatement. The company's policy and its Constitution and By-Laws had provisions stipulating the obligation to mail notice of assessments and the automatic lapse of the policy for failure to pay any assessment within fifteen days of notice. Additionally, if death occurred within one year from the reinstatement due to specified diseases, only a fraction of the policy amount was to be paid.

The jury found that the notice was mailed but not within the required fifteen days prior to the assessment due date, leading them to conclude that the policy did not lapse for non-payment. They also found that Mr. Noble was in good health at the time of reassessment and that neither heart disease nor kidney trouble, which were contributing causes, was the proximate cause of his death. The district court ruled in favor of Mrs. Noble, granting her the sum of $1,000, and the insurance company appealed the decision.

Verdict:
Based on the record, it was determined that the appellant, Border State Life Insurance Company, failed to provide timely notice of the premium assessment due on August 5 at least fifteen days prior to the due date. Therefore, there was no legitimate basis for claiming a lapse or suspension of Mr. Noble's life insurance policy. Despite appellant's argument that the policy was reinstated with limited coverage, the jury's findings indicated there was no legal lapse of the policy in the first place. The jury found that the notice of assessment was mailed but not within the stipulated timeframe, and they also found Mr. Noble to be in good health on the date of alleged reinstatement. Moreover, appellant's assertion of reduced payout due to death from specific diseases was rendered moot since there was no reinstatement in legal terms, and the decreased coverage contention did not stand.

Given these findings, the jury rejected the arguments for a decreased coverage and supported the continuation of the original policy terms, which were uncontestable after two yearsâ€”a period that had already elapsed by the date of the assumed reinstatement. Furthermore, any conflicting jury findings regarding the cause of Mr. Noble's death from the eligible diseases were inconsequential since the underlying assumption of policy lapse was unsupported.

The prediction is that the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in all respects because the appellant did not fulfill its obligation to provide due and timely notice of the premium assessment in accordance with the insurance policy's terms. Consequently, the insurance policy remained in effect, entitling the appellee, Mrs. Noble, to the full life insurance proceeds without any limitations based on the "good health" clause or specified disease-related restrictions.
