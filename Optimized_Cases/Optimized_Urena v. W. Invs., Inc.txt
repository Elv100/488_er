Background:
Maria Urena and her minor children, S. U. and L. U., resided at the Front Royale Apartments complex in Houston. Urena's sister, Araceli Grimaldo, lived in the same complex, and another sister, Olga Grimaldo, lived across the street at the English Oaks Apartment complex. On November 6, 1999, while Urena was at work, L. U. was left with Araceli and decided to retrieve some toys from his own apartment. During this, L. U. was lured into an apartment by a tenant, Miguel Angel Zuniga, who promised a dollar bill and then sexually assaulted L. U. The aunts discovered the assault, confronted Zuniga who fled before the police arrived, and he has never been found. Zuniga had prior traffic offense convictions but none for violent or sexual crimes.

Appellant Maria S. Urena filed an action against the apartment complex and individuals, for premises liability, among other claims, following her son's sexual assault. The trial court granted summary judgment against the mother, asserting no foreseeability of the crime and no proximate cause for the injury. In response, Urena argued that sufficient evidence of simple negligence and premises liability existed to show the injuries were caused by the defendants' breach of duty.

Over the previous three years before the assault, eight crimes were reported at or near the apartments, including a string of violent crimes such as attempted sexual assault, robberies, and murders. Evidence indicated that some crimes were well known to residents, which could suggest that the risk of such crimes should have been apparent to the apartment complex's management.

Verdict:
The court's decision will likely focus on whether the earlier violent crimes at the apartment complex established a foreseeable risk of harm to tenants from third-party criminal acts, thus necessitating a duty of care from the apartment complex to protect its residents. Based on the Timberwalk analysis, which guides the assessment of whether a premises owner has a duty to protect against foreseeable crimes, the court will investigate several factors: the proximity, recency, frequency, similarity, and publicity of previous criminal activity.

Given the significant number of violent crimes reported at the Front Royale Apartments within three years before the assault on L. U., a court would predict that these prior incidents may establish a pattern of criminal activity that should have been reasonably anticipated by the defendants. The crimes are sufficiently similar, as they are all violent personal crimes, making further violent criminal acts foreseeable.

The verdict will likely conclude that because the risk of similar violent crimes was foreseeable, the defendants (appellees) may have owed a legal duty to protect the residents, including L. U., from criminal acts, and a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding that duty. Hence, the court will find that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment and will reverse the trial court's judgment, remanding the case for further proceedings, except for the dismissed causes of action which were not challenged on appeal (breach of contract, implied warranty of habitability, and violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act). The court will probably support the need for a full trial to address the issues of foreseeability and the defendants' potential duty of care more thoroughly.
