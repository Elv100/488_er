Background:
J.A. Norris suffered injuries due to the negligence of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company of Texas while he was riding in a box car during a "flying switch." The exact nature of these injuries was not definitively established except for harm to his leg, hip, and a skinned area on his cheek or forehead. This incident occurred on a Saturday afternoon. The following day, Norris, despite some difficulty, loaded some freight onto a wagon pulled by a team of mules with the intention to head home. During this journey, Norris fell from the wagon, sustaining unknown additional injuries. A week after the initial box car incident, he died from a brain hemorrhage.

Norris's wife and children filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the railway, and the jury returned a judgment in their favor. An appeal was made by the railway, which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, leading to the railway seeking further review.

The plaintiffs' theory of recovery was based on several points: a) Norris's death was a direct result of injuries from the box car incident; b) the fall from the wagon was caused by the box car injuries and was also a direct cause of his death; c) Norris suffered various injuries due to the railway's negligence; d) all injuries from both incidents were the direct result of the railway's negligence.

The railway contested these theories and claimed that the injuries from the fall were the direct cause of death and were caused by an independent event not connected to the railway. Special issues were presented to the jury, which found that while the injuries from the box car did contribute to Norris's death, they were not the only cause, and the fall was not directly caused by the box car injuries.

The railway sought judgment based on the jury's responses and requested additional issues for the court to consider, which were denied. The railway contended that there had been an independent, subsequent cause of Norris's fall from the wagon and the resulting injuries that led to his death.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the judgments of the lower courts due to the failure of the jury to determine the proximate cause of death, which is critical in supporting the judgment. Despite the jury's answers to special issues indicating that the box car injuries contributed to Norris's death, these answers are not conclusive enough to establish either the box car or falls injuries as the proximate cause.

The railway's requested issue, which was to find the proximate cause of death in relation to the box car incident, should have been given, especially since the previous questions failed to facilitate the jury's decision-making regarding the evidence on this point. The case will be remanded for a new trial where this central issue, along with potentially others suggested by the evidence, should be properly addressed. There has been no affirmative finding indicating that the injury in the box car or the subsequent fall from the wagon were individually or jointly the proximate cause of Norris's death. Since there was no proper basis for the judgment against the railway without this finding, a new trial is warranted. The court makes no particular stance on the impact of the evidence or what issues it might raise for the new trial to avoid influencing the proceedings.
