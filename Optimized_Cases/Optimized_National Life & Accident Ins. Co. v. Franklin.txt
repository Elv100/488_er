Background:
Appellee Richard E. Franklin and his wife, Doris, brought suit against appellant National Life and Accident Insurance Company to recover accidental death benefits under two insurance policies issued on the life of Doris Franklinâ€™s son, Larry W. Fife. The policies, one from 1962 and one from 1966, provided death benefits and additional accidental death benefits. Basic benefits had been paid, and the dispute concerned only the accidental death benefits. The appellees also sought a statutory penalty and attorney's fees under Texas law. The insured, Fife, was found dead in his apartment, lying over the edge of the bathtub with little water since the drain was open. The autopsy showed drowning as the cause of death but indicated that a seizure might have occurred at or near the time of death, evidenced by a bitten tongue, distended neck veins, and a contorted head position.

The policies defined coverage for accidents occurring directly and independently of all other causes, effected solely through external, violent, and accidental means, excluding deaths contributed to by any disease or mental infirmity. The jury determined that Fife's death resulted directly and independently from an accident and not from disease or mental infirmity. The appellant challenged the verdict, arguing insufficient evidence to support that the insured died solely by accidental means and that the death was not contributed to by the insured's known mild epileptic condition.

Verdict:
The verdict to award accidental death benefits to appellee Doris Franklin will be based on the jury's findings that align with the relevant policy definitions and legal precedents. The court will affirm that epilepsy might have caused Fife to fall but did not cause the death by drowning, making the epileptic seizure at most a remote cause in the chain of events leading to death. This reasoning follows Texas Supreme Court decisions that preexisting conditions do not bar recovery if they are too remote to have materially contributed to death. Given that drowning was the immediate cause of death, and assuming epilepsy did cause the fall, epilepsy will be considered a remote cause, not affecting the accidental nature of the death in legal terms.

The court will likely reject the appellant's contention that Fife's death was contributed to by a disease, as the policy language necessitates a proximate cause, not simply a contributing or remote factor. The phrase "contributed to" in the policy will not extend liability to remote causes in the causal chain. The court will probably follow the reasoning that the disease need only be a proximate, not the sole, cause to satisfy the exclusion, which is not the case here. As the jury found that the insured's death was caused solely by accidental means, and because the evidence did not compel that epilepsy was more than a remote cause in Fife's death, the jury's verdict will be sustained, and the appellant's challenges will be overruled. The judgment from the trial court in favor of appellees will be affirmed.
