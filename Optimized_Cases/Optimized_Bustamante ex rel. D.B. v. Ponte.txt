Background:
D.B., a premature infant, was born on May 19, 2005, at Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso, Texas. At birth, she weighed 600 grams (1.32 pounds) and had a gestational age between 23 weeks and 1 day and 24 weeks. Due to her severe prematurity, D.B. had a 90-100% chance of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding retinal disorder. Unfortunately, D.B. suffered total blindness in her right eye and severe vision impairment in her left eye as a result of ROP.

D.B.’s parents, the Bustamantes, filed a lawsuit against Del Sol Medical Center, Enrique N. Ponte Jr., M.D. (neonatologist and NICU medical director), and Jorge Fabio Llamas-Soforo, M.D. (ophthalmologist), claiming their negligence resulted in D.B.'s vision loss. Del Sol settled before trial, and a jury trial proceeded against Dr. Ponte and Dr. Llamas.

Dr. Ponte testified he requested an "early" examination of D.B.'s eyes by Dr. Llamas, who first examined D.B.'s eyes on July 4, 2005, noting "incomplete vascularization in zone II of the retina" although due to a transcription error, the records indicated "complete vascularization." Dr. Llamas scheduled a follow-up in four weeks, ignoring the 2001 Statement regarding ROP screening, which dictated closer follow-up intervals given D.B.'s situation.

On August 1, Dr. Llamas diagnosed that ROP had developed significantly and recommended immediate laser therapy, which was delayed for three more days. Despite the treatment, D.B.'s right retina detached, causing permanent blindness. In her left eye, she has severe visual impairment demanding her to hold items close even with glasses.

Competing expert witnesses testified on whether the doctors’ negligence was the proximate cause of D.B.'s impaired vision. Dr. Good and Dr. Phelps, experts for the Bustamantes, opined the untimely diagnosis and treatment were substantial factors in D.B.'s outcomes. Dr. Good believed that with proper exam schedule adherence, treatment could have occurred earlier, thus averting the severe results.

After the trial, the jury found Dr. Ponte 45% responsible and Dr. Llamas 45% responsible for D.B.’s injuries, awarding total damages of over $2.1 million. The non-settling defendants appealed, arguing the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's findings, and the court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of causation, as the experts' testimonies did not establish a "but-for" cause of D.B.'s injuries.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court of Texas will reverse the court of appeals’ judgment regarding Dr. Ponte and his professional association and remand the case for further consideration due to errors made by the lower court. The Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury's finding of negligence on the part of Dr. Ponte, emphasizing that the substantial-factor test, rather than a strict but-for causation standard, should have been applied in assessing the combined negligence leading to D.B.’s poor visual outcome.

The Court will determine that rejecting the statistical evidence premised on the ETROP study was an error and that Dr. Good's and Dr. Phelps's expert opinions were indeed based on substantial evidence and were not merely conclusory. Both experts' testimonies, albeit imperfect, provided a rationale for their opinions and explained how earlier diagnosis and treatment could have likely changed D.B.'s prognosis. The Court will assert that the cumulative evidence from the trial demonstrated D.B.'s vision loss was more likely than not caused by the combined negligence in delaying diagnosis and treatment of her ROP. Consequently, the Court will remand the case, instructing the court of appeals to address any other outstanding issues that have not been previously examined.
