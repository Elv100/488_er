Background:
The background of the case involves a fire in a four-plex apartment building owned by the appellant landlord, C.L. Daniels a/k/a C.L. Mayon. Appellee Roseletta Mitchell and her two children, Kori Johnson and Kourtney Mitchell, were tenants in the building. On November 16, 1994, a fire broke out when Kourtney, age five, overturned a candle. Roseletta and her children initially escaped uninjured, and Kori, age nine, called 911. After five to seven minutes outside, Roseletta re-entered the building to alert other tenants but did not hear functioning smoke detectors. Kori followed to look for his mother and tragically died in the fire due to burns, smoke inhalation, and carbon monoxide toxicity.

The apartment's smoke detector beeped for less than a second and stopped, and no other alarms were heard as there were no smoke detectors in common areas. The appellees sued Daniels for negligence and gross negligence, resulting in Kori's death, arguing that Daniels failed to install or maintain proper fire safety devices and had non-compliant burglar bars on windows. The bench trial resulted in a $1,000,000 verdict against Daniels. Daniels appealed, arguing that there was no violation of Tex. Prop. Code § 92.251 et seq. regarding smoke detector installation and that there was insufficient evidence of causation. At trial, Roseletta testified about complaints to Daniels regarding the smoke detector, which Daniels did not contest.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial verdict in favor of the appellees. It held that Daniels had waived her defense regarding non-compliance with the Texas Smoke Detector Statute because she did not raise the issue at trial. Even though Daniels moved for a judgment asserting no evidence of causation and also made a post-judgment motion for a new trial based on causation, she did not challenge the appellees' compliance with the request and notice provisions at any point.

Furthermore, the court found that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the lack of functioning smoke detectors was the cause in fact of the appellees' injuries. Given the absence of alarms, Roseletta's decision to re-enter the building to warn other tenants and Kori's subsequent re-entry to look for his mother were considered foreseeable. It was reasonable for them to believe that they needed to rescue others due to the lack of functioning smoke detectors and alarms. Danielle failed to install and maintain smoke detectors throughout the building, which constituted negligence and created an emergency situation requiring rescue efforts.

By applying the rescue doctrine, the court concluded that the acts of the rescuers (Roseletta and Kori) were foreseeable results of Daniels's negligent actions, as they attempted to mitigate the imminent peril caused by the absence of warning devices. The evidence was sufficient both legally and factually to support the trial court’s findings of both cause in fact and foreseeability, justifying the decision to affirm the trial court's judgment against Daniels.
