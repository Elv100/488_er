Background:
Henry Yap, the appellant, sustained personal injuries resulting from an automobile-truck collision and sued ANR Freight Systems, Inc. ("ANR"), and its employee-driver, David Glenn Coplin. The trial court entered a take-nothing judgment against Yap following a jury verdict. Yap asserted that Coplin's negligence contributed to the collision and that ANR negligently entrusted its vehicle to Coplin. At trial, it was established that on the day of the accident, the weather was misty and the road was wet. Coplin testified that a red car unexpectedly entered his lane from a side street, leading him to brake suddenly and his truck to jackknife into Yap's lane, where the collision occurred. Evidence showed that Coplin was traveling between 25 to 30 mph in a 35 mph zone and took measures to avoid hitting the red car. There were conflicting expert opinions on whether Coplin was negligent in his operation of the vehicle or if he could have anticipated the red car's entrance into the lane. Yap also presented evidence of Coplinâ€™s past medical history, which included surgery for blocked arteries and high blood pressure, to support the negligent entrustment claim. Additionally, a 1980 letter was entered into evidence questioning Coplin's qualifications in an unrelated incident.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, as the evidence at trial could reasonably lead to different conclusions regarding whether Coplin's negligence and past medical issues were the proximate cause of the collision. The court will conclude that the jury appropriately determined that Coplin's negligence was not the substantial factor in causing the collision, and rather, the sudden and unexpected action of the red car pulling onto Mykawa Road was an "unavoidable accident" not caused by any party's negligence. Regarding the negligent entrustment claim against ANR, the court will find that Yap failed to prove the fifth element, as Coplin's ongoing health did not proximately cause the accident, notably because there was no evidence of impairment at the time of the collision. Furthermore, the court will dismiss concerns raised by the admission of the photograph of the speed limit sign; it will determine that the image did not affect the judgment since speed control was not linked to proximate cause, which was the core issue. The court will uphold the jury's discretion in weighing witness credibility and reject Yap's assertion that the exclusion of certain testimonies from his expert witness prejudicially affected the outcome. Consequently, the appellate court, agreeing with the jury's evaluation of the facts and finding sufficient legal and factual evidence to support the jury's findings, will affirm the take-nothing judgment against Yap.
