Background:
Jodi Marie Mason, who suffered from depression, voluntarily entered the Minirth-Meier Unit of Cedars Hospital on July 26, 1993. Her scheduled discharge was set for August 20, 1993. Mason was initially placed on suicide watch and close observation. Dr. Teofilo Moses Ramos, a staff psychiatrist, examined her and concluded that suicide precautions could be discontinued. During her stay, Mason's roommate was Cynthia Thomas, whom she described as manipulative and controlling. Despite this, Mason and Thomas became friends. 

On August 16, 1993, Thomas requested and obtained an unsupervised early discharge from Nurse Sandra Duryea Marx following an order from Thomas's physician, Dr. Paul Meier. Marx informed Thomas's physician about the discharge request but did not take any action regarding Thomas's request that Mason be discharged as well. Subsequently, Mason independently requested an early discharge and expressed her intent to spend time with Thomas after leaving. Marx assessed Mason's condition, notified Ramos by phone, and discharged Mason per Ramos's order. 

Twenty-eight hours post-discharge, Mason was involved in a car accident with Thomas (who was also discharged) and another patient, Richard Cleveland. Thomas, driving at a high rate of speed, swerved to avoid a dog, resulting in a crash that killed Cleveland and paralyzed Mason. Thomas was also injured. Mason did not sue Thomas but brought a lawsuit against Ramos, Marx, Meier, Cedars Hospital, and the Minirth-Meier Clinic on various negligence grounds including improper discharge, failure to provide adequate care, and failure to warn Mason of the danger posed by Thomas. The trial court granted summary judgment against Mason on the grounds that defendants' negligence was not the proximate cause of Mason's injuries, which the court of appeals in part reversed. 

Verdict:
Upon reviewing the case, the court will likely find that the defendants’— the physician, the nurse, and the mental health care facility—alleged negligence is too remote from Mason's post-discharge injuries to be considered the proximate cause as a matter of law. The court will assert that while the facility and medical professionals had a duty of care, they were not obligated to insure Mason's well-being after being discharged from their care.

The court will discuss the concept of proximate cause, considering that the negligence must be a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's injury, and not merely a condition which makes the injury possible. The court will explain that the defendants' actions potentially contributed to the circumstance of Mason being in the car with Thomas at the time of the accident but were not "active and efficient" causes of the crash itself. The court will draw parallels with similar case precedents, emphasizing that the mere occurrence of a negligent act which eventually leads to an injury does not sufficiently establish a direct and substantial cause-and-effect relationship required for proximate cause.

Expert testimony provided by Mason asserting proximate cause will likely be deemed insufficient to create a fact issue on causation, as it fails to establish a concrete link between the alleged negligence and the actual accident. The court will point out that speculation that Ramos's discharge caused Mason to be injured in Thomas's car wreck is attenuated and would incorrectly make the defendants insurers of Mason's safety in any situation post-discharge.

Predicting the court's reasoning based on Texas law and precedents, it is expected that they will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals regarding the physician, the nurse, and the mental health care facility, rendering a verdict in favor of the defendants, resulting in Mason taking nothing from the suit filed against these parties.
