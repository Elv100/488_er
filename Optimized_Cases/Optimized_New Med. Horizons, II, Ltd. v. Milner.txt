Background:
Appellee Vickie Milner, a diabetic, was admitted to Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center for a left-foot infection, and she alleged that the negligence of appellants Anand Balasubramanian, M.D., Doan K. Nguyen, M.D., and the nursing staff of New Medical Horizons, II, LTD D/B/A Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center led to a gangrenous condition, resulting in the amputation of her great toe followed by a protracted recovery. The appellants moved to dismiss Milner's healthcare liability claims, claiming that her expert's report was inadequate. In the interlocutory appeal, the appellants contested the adequacy of the expert report by Marc E. Mitchell, M.D., regarding qualifications, standard of care, breach of care, and causation.

Dr. Balasubramanian, an internal medicine physician, treated Milner and ordered an infectious disease consultation and a surgical consultation with Dr. Nguyen, an orthopedic surgeon, who recommended surgery to remove a foreign body and debride Milner's foot. Surgery was performed, but there was allegedly little follow-up or documented wound care. Five days post-surgery, Milner was discovered to have a gangrenous diabetic left-foot infection and underwent a vascular consult. Subsequently, she needed an amputation of her great toe and further procedures due to critical limb ischemia.

Milner's filed a lawsuit within the timeframe required by the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and Dr. Mitchell provided an expert report which the defendants contended failed to meet the requirements of a fair summary of the standard of care, breach, and causation. The trial court denied the motions to dismiss by the appellants, leading to this appeal.

Verdict:
The court will likely affirm the trial court's orders, finding that Dr. Mitchell's expert report did not constitute an abuse of discretion and met the legal requirements for an expert report under Section 74.351 of the Texas Medical Liability Act (TMLA). Dr. Mitchell was qualified because his experience and practice involved caring for patients with conditions similar to Milner’s, and the connection between vascular surgery and internal medicine in cases involving diabetic foot wounds is sufficiently close to establish relevance.

Dr. Mitchell's report will be considered satisfactory as it provided a fair summary of the standards of care pertinent to Dr. Balasubramanian, Dr. Nguyen, and the nursing staff, outlined specific actions they should have undertaken, detailed the alleged breaches, and articulated the causal chain linking the alleged negligence to the harm that befell Milner. The report will be deemed to have met the statutory requirements by informing the defendants of the particular medical acts under scrutiny and providing the basis for a conclusion that the claims had merit. The argument by Dr. Balasubramanian and Dr. Nguyen challenging the connecting link between the breach and injury will be rejected as premature, with further factual examination reserved for later stages of litigation.

Furthermore, the report’s adequacy will not be judged on its ability to exclude all possible causes of Milner’s injuries, but rather on its demonstration of a “good-faith effort to explain, factually,” the causative connection expected to be proven. Any additional detail that the appellants challenge as missing from the report will be considered beyond the scope of requirement at this pre-discovery stage. Thus, the report of Dr. Mitchell will be deemed to have advanced an objective and legitimate effort to establish a “straightforward link” between the appellants' actions and the patient’s damages.
