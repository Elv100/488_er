Background:
Robert B. Dean filed a lawsuit against over twenty loan companies and three insurance companies, accusing them of charging him usurious interest on loans and causing damages through aggressive collection efforts. During the course of the case, many of the defendants were either dismissed or settled, leaving a few defendants when the case proceeded to trial. The trial encompassed more than 300 issues presented to the jury, which resulted in various judgments against several defendants:

- Western Guaranty Loan Company was ordered to pay $224.40 as double usury charges (punitive damages for excessive interest) and $1,800 for reckless collection efforts.
- Louis K. Cassett, J. H. Pollack, and Joseph H. Pollack, doing business as Royal Finance Company, were ordered to pay $174.56 as double usury charges and $600 for reckless collection efforts.
- Chlo Vean Smith Wheatley was ordered to pay $40.98 as double usury charges and initially $1,800 for reckless collection efforts, which was later reduced to $800 upon remittitur by the trial court.
- Judgments non obstante veredicto were rendered in favor of Bankers Health and Accident Company, City National Life Insurance Company, and Southern Life Insurance Company, dismissing them from the case.
- Judgments were rendered in favor of W. L. Caldwell and Mrs. J. A. Allison, owners of Triangle Loan Service, based on the jury verdict.

Several points of appeal were raised, including whether the collection efforts justified the damages awarded and whether specific charges could be considered part of usurious interest. Key issues debated included whether credit insurance premiums could be regarded as part of usurious interest charged, the application of payments made by Dean (which might otherwise be subject to the statute of limitations), collective responsibility for the damages, and improper service of citation based on marital status and other procedural errors. Another pertinent aspect was whether the insurance companies, as principals of the loan companies who acted as their agents, could be liable for the usurious interest due to the insurance premiums rolled into the loans.

Verdict:
In the appellate decision, the verdict is a mixture of affirmations, reversals, and modifications to the trial court's judgment:

- The court is expected to agree with Dean on the inclusion of credit insurance premiums as part of the usurious interest, given the jury's support and adequate evidence, meaning these premiums will be factored into the usurious interest.
- The court will likely modify the judgment against Western Guaranty Loan Company, reducing it by $122.40, due to the statute of limitations affecting part of the usury calculations.
- There will probably be an assertion that no new service of citation was necessary when amended pleadings only increased the damages sought and did not constitute a new cause of action.
- It is probable that the appellate court will clarify that a judgment against an individual concerning their business dealings while married should stand if the individual participates in the legal process subsequently.
- The court is anticipated to reverse and remand the decisions related to damages for reckless collection efforts by certain defendants, noting the incorrect handling of indivisible damages.
- The appellate court decision is likely to reaffirm the trial courtâ€™s judgment for usury and penalties against Royal Finance Company and Chlo Vean Wheatley.
- It is expected that the court will dispute the liability of the insurance companies for usurious interest on the grounds that interest and usury pertain to a lending relationship, which is not the case between Dean and the insurance companies. 
- Judgments relating to the insurance companies are expected to be affirmed given that the insurance companies received premiums for insurance policies and not for interest on loans. Since the insurance premiums were not considered usury under the money borrowed, the insurance companies are not to be held liable on usury grounds.
- It is envisaged that the appellant's arguments challenging the sufficiency of service due to marital status changes will likely fail due to appearances made in the process, curing any defects in the service.
- Decisions in favor of defendants with whom Dean has settled are anticipated to be upheld, and the appellate court is expected to reject the notion that settlements with some defendants could extinguish the cause of action entirely.
- The court is expected to uphold the judgments for usury and penalties, albeit with some modifications, and is forecasted to require a retrial for the assessment of collective damages due to wrongful collection efforts.
