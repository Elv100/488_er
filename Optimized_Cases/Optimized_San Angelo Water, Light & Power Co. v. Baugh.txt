Background:
The appellant public utilities (San Angelo Water, Light & Power Company and Texas Electric & Power Company) were engaged in a negligence action brought by the appellee, B. E. Baugh, an employee of the San Angelo Telephone Company. Baugh filed a suit against the appellants for personal injuries he sustained at his workplace. The injury occurred when Baugh, who worked at the switchboard, contacted the public utilities to report that their high-power electric line was interfering with the switchboard operations. He requested that they turn off the current, which they did not do, and subsequently Baugh was injured when electricity from the high-power line entered the telephone apparatus and electrocuted him.

The appellants presented a defense with arguments including a general denial, contributory negligence, and assumed risk. During the trial, evidence was provided by various witnesses, including testimony from John Y. Rust, president of the telephone company, regarding payment made to the telephone company by the appellants for damages to the switchboard. This was used to demonstrate an admission against interest. The control and condition of the high-power line, the static line, and the associated safety equipment were all at issue, with evidence presented that the safety mechanisms did not function as they should have, suggesting negligence on the part of the appellants.

A key part of the defense's argument was the refusal to recognize the cashier's authority to bind the corporation in acknowledging the payment for damages, claiming the individual had no such authority to make admissions against the appellants’ interest. However, testimony suggested that payments were indeed made and settled against appellants’ bills, and there were no demands made by the appellants for a return of payments which suggest an admission of liability. The case also hinged on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, implying negligence because the accident is one that does not usually occur without negligence and was within the exclusive control of the appellants.

Verdict:
The verdict will affirm the trial court's decision in favor of the appellee, B. E. Baugh. The judgment will be based on several key points of rationale. Firstly, the testimony from nonexperts about Baugh's change in disposition post-accident will be deemed admissible as it indicates a potential impact from the injury and is within the permissible range of nonexpert testimony on changes in a person's condition. This testimony is considered relevant as it tends to show some ill effects from the electric shock upon Baugh's physical being.

Additionally, the payment made by the public utilities for the damages to the telephone company’s switchboard will be viewed as an admission against interest, suggesting that the appellants recognized liability for the damages resulting from their negligent actions. Even though the appellants contested the cashier's authority to make the admission, the evidence will support that the cashier, as the agent of the appellants, had apparent authority to accept payment, thus confirming the settlement and the resultant admissions of liability.

In terms of the defense's argument regarding the act of the cat as an uncontrollable event, the court will dismiss this explanation as unpersuasive because it fails to adequately address the established negligence on the part of the appellants in maintaining the high-power line.

Applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the verdict will conclude that it was the appellants' negligent conduct that allowed the excessive and dangerous amount of electricity to escape and injure the appellee. Given that the injury is of the nature that it would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence by the entity controlling the high-power line, and the appellants failed to cut off the power when alerted to the interference, the verdict will determine that the appellants are liable for Baugh’s injuries.

Concerning the award amount, the verdict will consider the quantum of damages reasonable and not a result of passion, prejudice, or partiality on the part of the jury. The scope of Baugh’s injuries and their impact on his health and quality of life will justify the judgment amount awarded to him. Therefore, the decision of the trial court awarding $4,500 in damages will be upheld, thus affirming the judgment.
