Background:
On November 15, 1964, a collision occurred at the Lee Street crossing in Midland, Texas, between a Texas and Pacific Railway train and a car driven by plaintiff-appellee Jewell Hoyle. The car belonged to Inez Baker, who had eight children as passengers and was attempting to cross the railroad tracks to make a left turn onto Highway 80 towards Odessa. Baker’s car stalled on the tracks when the line of traffic stopped due to a change in traffic signals. Despite attempts to get help, the car remained stalled for about five to six minutes, with no train in sight initially. As the train approached, Hoyle used his vehicle to bump Baker’s car off the tracks, attempting a rescue. However, amidst this rescue, Hoyle’s car also stalled, and he was struck by the train as he tried to escape from it.

Significant evidence presented during the case included the following:

- Hoyle, in his attempt to rescue Baker and the children, did not act rashly or recklessly according to the jury.
- The engineer, J. H. Johnson, and the fireman aboard the train had a clear and unobstructed view for at least a mile before the collision, and the approach to the crossing was straight and level.
- Johnson testified that he was familiar with the crossing, knew it to be busy, and admitted they were running late.
- Witnesses confirmed that the Baker car was stationary on the tracks several minutes before the train arrived and that it stalled long before the warning lights began flashing.
- McClinton, the fireman, acknowledged that from as far back as the stock pens, he could see cars at the crossing. The stock pens were approximately 3,866 feet east of the crossing.
- Evidence indicated that the train, traveling at 40 miles per hour, could have stopped in time if a proper lookout had been maintained.
- The train crew denied seeing Baker’s car on the tracks and claimed they only saw Hoyle’s car when they were 250 to 350 feet away.
- The jury determined several acts of contributory negligence by Hoyle but also found that his actions were part of a rescue effort, and he did not act in a rash and reckless manner.
- The rescue doctrine was deemed applicable in the case, and the jury made specific findings that supported this doctrine.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment for appellee motorist Jewell Hoyle. The jury's findings determined that the engineer failed to maintain a proper lookout, and this failure was a proximate cause of the accident. Although the jury found Hoyle had committed acts of contributory negligence, these were excused under the rescue doctrine, given that he was attempting to save Baker and the children from imminent peril. This was supported by the jury's findings that Hoyle did not act rashly or recklessly during the rescue. The negligence of the train operators in failing to keep a proper lookout, when they had a clear, unobstructed view for at least a mile from the crossing and knew it was a busy intersection, was a substantial factor leading to the collision. Therefore, the legal standard of care required of Hoyle was reduced due to the sudden emergency of the rescue situation, and any negligence attributed to him was mitigated by the circumstances. The elements of the rescue doctrine were correctly submitted to the jury and supported by evidence with probative force, which leads to the verdict affirming the judgment for Hoyle's personal injuries, medical expenses, and property damage. The court found no merit in the appellant's point that the judgment for medical expenses was incorrect, as the awarded amount was uncontested and the least amount testified in the case, causing no injury to the appellant. Hence, the court found that all of the appellant's points were without merit and affirmed the trial court's decision.
