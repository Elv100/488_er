Background:
Tonya M. Archibeque, as the heir of the deceased Janae Devries, filed a wrongful death and survival action against North Texas State Hospital (appellee), which is part of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. Archibeque's mother, Janae Devries, was a patient at the hospital and allegedly committed suicide by using a trash bag and shoe laces. Archibeque claims that the hospital was negligent in providing Devries with the means to commit suicide, given her history of suicidal tendencies. She also alleges that the hospital employees were negligent in their monitoring of Devries during sleeping hours by failing to use a flashlight and by improperly diagnosing Devries's mental status in her medical chart.

Archibeque appealed the trial court's dismissal of her case, which was based on the hospital's plea to the jurisdiction. The hospital claimed sovereign immunity since the legislature had not consented to the suit. The court's dismissal was grounded on the hospital's assertion of sovereign immunity due to the absence of legislative consent to the action, as is required for tort liability claims against governmental entities.

In her appeal, Archibeque contends that the hospital’s sovereign immunity has been waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act because the death was caused by the use or misuse of tangible personal property, specifically the trash bag and shoe laces. The hospital’s plea was based on the allegation that it was immune from suit for tort liability since the legislature did not consent to the suit, and the court challenge was primarily to contest the hospital's sovereign immunity.

Verdict:
The verdict upheld the trial court’s decision that the hospital's immunity from suit had not been waived and thus, the hospital remained sovereignly immune from suit. The court will reason that Archibeque did not sufficiently allege that her mother’s death was proximately caused by the hospital's use or misuse of the tangible personal property in question. While Devries used a trash bag and shoe laces to commit suicide, the court will rule that Archibeque's arguments did not establish that the hospital's provision or use of these items proximately caused her death. The mere presence of these items in Devries's room was found to only create a condition that made suicide possible, but it was not the use of the property that led to the death. 

The court will conclude that Archibeque failed to state a claim for which immunity is waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act. Archibeque’s assertions of nonuse of property (failing to use a flashlight and improperly utilizing Devries's medical chart) will be dismissed, as nonuse of property does not support a claim under the Act. Furthermore, the detail of medical diagnosis or lack thereof on paper is not considered tangible property under the Act. The central substance of Archibeque's complaint will be determined to be the failure of the hospital staff to protect Devries from harm due to her suicidal history, rather than the use of the trash bag and shoelaces, which will not fall within the limited waiver of immunity provided by the Texas Tort Claims Act. Consequently, the court’s reasoning will maintain that Archibeque did not affirmatively establish the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, and as such, the plea to the jurisdiction was properly granted by the lower court. Archibeque’s sole point on appeal will be overruled, and the court will affirm the trial court’s judgment.
