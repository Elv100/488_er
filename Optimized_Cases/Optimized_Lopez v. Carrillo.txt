Background:
Plaintiff Miguel N. Lopez visited defendant dentist Emma Carrillo, D.D.S., for dental work. During the procedure, a dental drill bit (referred to as a bur) fell into Lopez's mouth while it was open and landed on the back of his tongue, which he then swallowed. The precise mechanism causing the bur to be dropped is disputed: either it came loose from a drill being used by Carrillo or became magnetized to another instrument and then detached. Lopez alleged that as a result of swallowing the drill bit, he suffered physical pain, mental anguish, and incurred medical expenses.

Carrillo moved for summary judgment on the grounds of absence of negligence and that her actions were not the proximate cause of any damages to Lopez. Carrillo supported her motion with an affidavit stating she adhered to the applicable standard of care and that her actions did not proximately cause Lopez any harm. Lopez objected to the affidavit as being based on hearsay, conclusory, and lacking indication of the source of Carrillo's personal knowledge. Lopez filed his own affidavit, claiming it raised material fact issues regarding negligence and proximate cause.

Carrillo responded by objecting to portions of Lopez's affidavit and moved to supplement her summary judgment evidence with deposition testimony from Dr. Mario Jimenez, who stated Lopez suffered no physical harm from swallowing the drill bit. The trial court struck the contested parts of Lopez's affidavit, allowed Carrillo to supplement her evidence, and granted summary judgment in her favor without stating the grounding reasons.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Emma Carrillo, D.D.S., holding that her expert testimony successfully negated the negligence and proximate cause elements of the plaintiff, Miguel N. Lopez's, cause of action. Thus, Carrillo will be entitled to summary judgment as there is no fact issue raised by Lopez that would warrant a trial.

In reaching this verdict, the court will find Carrillo's affidavit to be competent evidence for summary judgment. It will determine that Carrillo's qualifications as a dental expert and her account of the treatment she provided to Lopez illustrated her personal knowledge of the incident and the actions she took immediately afterwards. The court will conclude that it is not necessary for the affidavit to detail how personal knowledge was acquired when it is evident from the content of the testimony.

Additionally, the hearsay statements within Carrillo's affidavit regarding Lopez's medical condition, relayed to her by another physician, will not lead to the affidavit's incompetency since experts can rely on hearsay in forming their opinions under Texas Rule of Civil Evidence 703. Furthermore, the court will deem Carrillo's statements in her affidavit not impermissibly conclusory when read in proper context.

Regarding Lopez's summary judgment proof based on his own affidavit, the court will find it insufficient to raise a fact issue on proximate cause. It will determine that expert testimony is generally required to establish both medical negligence and causation, and that while Lopez's affidavit may challenge Carrillo's version of events in regards to negligence, it fails to present any expert testimony on causation. Therefore, without such testimony to contradict Carrillo's expert assessment, no fact issue on proximate cause exists.

Overall, since Carrillo's expert testimony as a movant in a medical malpractice action conclusively negated the elements of Lopez's cause of action and Lopez, as the non-movant, failed to provide competent summary judgment proof to raise a fact issue, Carrillo will be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Consequently, the summary judgment will be affirmed, siding with Carrillo.
