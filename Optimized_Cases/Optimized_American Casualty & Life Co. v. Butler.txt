Background:
The insurance company issued a health and disability policy to an insured individual, which stipulated that any disability resulting from heart trouble would only be covered if the disease originated more than six months after the date of the policy. The insured became ill and was bedridden, and a physician initially diagnosed him with heart disease. However, the physician later found blood in the patient's chest fluid and diagnosed inoperable bronchus and lung cancer. The insured passed away, and the insurance company denied liability, claiming that the individual had contracted heart disease within six months of the issuance of the policy. The trial court granted the beneficiary's motion for a directed verdict because cancer, not heart disease, was the proximate cause of the disability, and the court held that the insurance company had waived the 10-day notice of proof provision by denying liability on the policy.

The insurance company appealed based on three points: (1) the evidence established that the insured suffered from heart trouble and disability resulting partly from that, which was excluded by the policy, (2) no written notice of the insured's disability was given within ten days of its beginning, and no medical reports were furnished at intervals of thirty days as required, and (3) insufficient evidence to prove that the assured's cancer and resulting disability did not originate within 30 days of the date of the policy.

The non-medical evidence presented showed that the insured had been in good health and regularly employed before becoming disabled on or about October 15, 1945. He had no visible ailments or recent doctor visits. After becoming ill, the physician initially treated the insured for heart disease but later diagnosed him with cancer. Despite heart troubles, the medical testimony established that the insured could have returned to work were it not for the cancer. The insurance company denied the claim on the basis that the insured had heart trouble that should have excluded him from coverage, but did not raise concerns about the late notice or incomplete medical reports in their denial.

Verdict:
Considering the insurance company's decision to base their denial of the claim solely on the assertion that the disability was caused by heart trouble excluded by the policy, it's predictable that the court will find this constitutes a waiver of other defenses, such as the late notice and incomplete medical reports. The denial letter, focusing on the heart condition and refunding premiums, suggests that technical compliance with the notice and report requirements was no longer an issue for the company. Thus, the court will likely reject the insurance company's appeal concerning the lack of proper notice and medical reports, as it will be seen as having waived these defenses by not raising them at the time of denial.

As for the evidence concerning the origination of the insured's cancer, the beneficiary provided testimony from relatives indicating the insured was in good health before October 15, 1945, and that he appeared healthy when the policy was issued. Although the insured's heart condition was chronic, it did not disable him until it became aggravated by cancer. The medical expert testified that the cancer independently caused the total disability insured against. Considering this, the court will likely overrule the insurance company's third point, as the evidence sufficiently supports the finding that the cancer and resultant disability did not originate within 30 days of the policy's start date.

Given the totality of the evidence, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, concluding that cancer was the proximate cause of the insured's disability, not the pre-existing heart condition, and that the beneficiary met the burden of proof to show the disability claim was justified under the terms of the policy.
