Background:
Eugenio Pinok, an employee at Wald-Tinkle Packaging & Distribution, Inc., was injured while stacking bags off a conveyor system. The accident occurred when his arm became stuck between the conveyor belt and the rollers as he attempted to free a jammed bag, without shutting off the power first. Pinok pursued Wald-Tinkle on the grounds of negligence, claiming the company failed to properly train him, warn of the dangers of removing jammed bags, and maintain a safe working environment due to maladjusted rollers.

Pinok's initial job training was largely observational, learning from co-workers. On the injury date, October 17, 2000, Pinok sustained an abrasive third-degree burn. He received medical treatment until February 14, 2001, but only performed light duty until early December 2000 due to his injury. He ceased working for Wald-Tinkle in December 2000 and started a new job in April 2001.

During the trial, Wald-Tinkle objected to the admission of evidence regarding failure to train and warn Pinok, as those theories were not included in Pinok's initial-disclosure responses and were only supplemented shortly before trial. The court determined Wald-Tinkle waived their objection by failing to object during trial. It was deemed that there was at least implicit good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice for the untimely supplementation.

Additionally, Wald-Tinkle contested having any duty to warn or train Pinok against removing stuck bags without powering down the conveyor. However, evidence showed Wald-Tinkle was aware of the danger, and Pinok was accustomed to removing bags in an unsafe manner that he'd observed from co-workers. There were also conflicting testimonies as to whether Pinok was ever formally trained on safe bag removal methods. A jury found Wald-Tinkle negligent and awarded Pinok $73,949.63 in damages; the trial court granted Wald-Tinkle's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) only in part, dismissing $8,000 awarded for past and future physical impairment.

Verdict:
Affirming the judgment, the court reasoned that Wald-Tinkle had a legal duty to either warn Pinok of the dangers associated with removing bags from the conveyor or to train him on how to safely address the issue. The detail that Pinok observed bag removal procedures from his co-workers, who themselves may have been improperly trained, combined with sufficient evidence that Wald-Tinkle was aware of this inappropriate practice, fulfills the standard for proving the company's duty to properly warn or train Pinok. Concluding that Wald-Tinkle had indeed neglected this duty, the verdict supports the jury's finding of negligence based on a breach of the duty to train or warn and the maladjustment negligence claim.

Regarding damages, the custodian of record affidavits regarding medical expenses, which were not countered by Wald-Tinkle, validated the jury's award for past medical expenses as reasonable. Wald-Tinkle's payment records and Pinok's testimony allowed for supporting an award of lost wages during the period Pinok ceased working at Wald-Tinkle until finding new employment. 

Sole proximate cause was also properly instructed in the charge, and the new and independent cause did not apply here as there was no separate force or party responsible for Pinok's injury. Given that Pinok was able to perform everyday life and work activities as before the accident, no distinct evidence was provided to support an award for physical impairment separate from pain and suffering or disfigurement. Thus, the dismissal of the $8,000 award for physical impairment was justified, and the judgment in favor of Pinok on his non-subscriber negligence claims is affirmed.
