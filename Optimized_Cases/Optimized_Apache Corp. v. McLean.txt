Background:
George J. McLean (McLean) worked as a Systems Technician for Southwestern Bell and had been engaged in repairing service lines owned by MCI but situated at Apache Corporation’s (Apache) offices. On February 5, 1987, he checked in with Apache's receptionist Gloria Wright (Wright) and office manager Ann Hammonds (Hammonds) carrying his tools and a Hewlett Packard set. The following day, Apache’s telephone systems man, Weldon Sikes (Sikes), noticed a Customer Access Panel (CAP) leased from AT&T was missing. Upon McLean’s return to complete his work, Sikes accused him of the theft. Wright and Hammonds supported Sikes' accusation, with Wright claiming she saw McLean leave with the CAP. McLean denied the theft and offered to display his equipment; Hammonds, disinterested, requested him to leave. Hammonds, instructed by Apache security head Greg Pyles (Pyles), called the police and initiated proceedings that led to McLean's arrest. McLean was arrested at his workplace, booked, and jailed overnight before a probable cause hearing the next day.

Meanwhile, on February 18, the CAP was found by an AT&T employee who had mistaken it for another piece of equipment, leading to its accidental removal. McLean’s innocence became apparent, but he was not immediately notified. Charges were eventually dropped; however, Apache did not inform McLean or apologize for the false accusation.

McLean sued Apache, Hammonds, and Wright for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and negligence. The jury favored McLean on all claims. Apache then moved for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict which the trial court granted on all issues except negligence and related damages. Both parties appealed.

Key facts include that McLean had no criminal record, the CAP and McLean's equipment were dissimilar, and the actual CAP was taken by mistake from Apache's office due to an AT&T employee's error. Testimony conflicted between witnesses. Some testified to McLean's innocence, while Wright, Hammonds, and Sikes claimed certainty of his guilt. There were questions as to whether McLean was adequately free to leave during confrontations, and whether Apache’s employees maliciously or negligently instigated legal action against him without probable cause.

Verdict:
The appellate court found that the evidence supported the jury's verdict favoring McLean on his malicious prosecution claim, determining the criminal prosecution commenced by Apache’s employees lacked probable cause, and terminated in McLean’s favor demonstrating his innocence. The appellate court would likely hold that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's finding of exemplary damages, and that the false imprisonment judgment should be upheld as the jury was entitled to believe McLean’s version of events. Regarding negligence, the appellate court would reverse the trial court's judgment for McLean, due to a lack of separate and distinct damages attributable to negligence beyond those for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.

On factual insufficiency cross-points surrounding the findings of lack of probable cause and malice, exemplary damages, and false imprisonment, the appellate court would validate the jury's determination. The evidence demonstrated Apache, through its employees, initiated the prosecution of McLean knowingly and without probable cause, acting with reckless disregard for his rights. The employees’ failure to act upon learning McLean’s innocence would be emphasized.

The appellate court would conclude that the actual damage award was supported by malicious prosecution and false imprisonment discovered by the jury; exemplary damages were reasonable and proportionate to actual damages. The employees’ actions proximately caused McLean's damages.

The appellate court would reverse and render the negligence claim, remand for entry of the jury’s verdict on malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, actual damages, and exemplary damages, determining that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's liability findings. The verdict against McLean regarding negligence would then be reversed, resulting in a take-nothing judgment on that claim, thereby giving effect to the jury's verdict in all respects.
