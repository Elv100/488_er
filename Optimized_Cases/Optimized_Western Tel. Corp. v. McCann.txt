Background:
A woman named Mrs. Sarah McCann was killed by a lightning strike while standing on the porch of her home near Taft, Texas, during a rain and electrical storm on August 26, 1932. The telephone company, Western Telephone Corporation of Texas, owned a telephone line composed of "through" and "local" wires strung on wooden poles near the McCann house. Mrs. McCann’s widower, Jack McCann, and their five children filed a wrongful death suit against the telephone company, alleging negligence in the manner the company disconnected a telephone line that had formerly served the McCann house.

At the time of the incident, the local wire came to a dead end in a nearby residence, with both telephones having been disconnected for some time. In front of the McCann residence, pole "X" carried a "drop" wire that previously connected the McCann house to the local line. The instrument in the McCann house was removed, and the wire ended at a spool just under the eaves of the front porch, where there was no ground wire or connection to the ground.

Lightning struck pole "A," east of the McCann house, causing the through wire to sever without damaging pole "X" or causing disturbance in the other house where the wire dead-ended. The plaintiffs contended that lightning surcharged the local line, traveled to pole "X," then to the drop wire, and subsequently struck Mrs. McCann.

The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment. However, upon further review, the court questioned whether the plaintiffs had sufficiently proven that the negligence of the telephone company was the proximate cause of Mrs. McCann’s death, especially considering expert testimony regarding the behavior of lightning and electrical discharges.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the judgments of the trial court and the intermediate appellate court, remanding for further proceedings. The court will conclude that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof by not providing substantial evidence that the telephone company's negligence directly contributed to Mrs. McCann's death. The testimony of electrical experts, who indicated Mrs. McCann was likely struck by an independent side stroke of lightning, will undermine the plaintiff's claims. The experts' consensus that lightning does not necessarily follow metallic paths and can produce multiple paths to earth will be taken into account, demonstrating that Mrs. McCann could have been killed by a direct lightning strike, independent of any alleged negligence by the telephone company. 

The court will determine that the plaintiff's argument relies on speculation and conjecture rather than tangible evidence that indisputably connects the lightning stroke at pole "A" with Mrs. McCann's death. The lack of physical evidence of a connection between the severed wire at pole "A" and the McCann front porch—such as burn marks or wire damage—will be particularly influential, as it does not support the theory of an electric current traveling down the local line to the drop wire and then to Mrs. McCann. Additionally, the fact that the conditions in the nearby house where the wire dead-ended were undisturbed will further weaken the plaintiff's position. The court will find the plaintiffs' evidence insufficient to demonstrate that the defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the damage suffered, rather than the strike being an unforeseeable act of nature. Therefore, the court will rule for a reversal due to a lack of legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's original finding of liability against the telephone company.
