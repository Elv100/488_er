Background:
Judith Weathersby sued Dr. Rex M. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association to recover damages for injuries she claims to have sustained as a result of alleged negligence during a post-hire physical examination. After being hired by ACS Industries, Inc., Weathersby underwent her employer-mandated physical examination conducted by Dr. Crago at MacGregor, a professional association of physicians. The examination included various tests, and during a Dynatron test—an evaluation of physical strength requiring the patient to pull upwards on a stationary bar—Weathersby strained her back.

Weathersby's lawsuit alleges that Dr. Crago’s negligence in administering the Dynatron test resulted in a spine compression fracture. However, Dr. Crago and MacGregor countered the allegations by moving for summary judgment on the basis that Weathersby’s claim fell under medical negligence, requiring her to prove duty, a breach of the standard of care, injury, and that the breach proximately caused the injury. 

According to the defendants, Dr. Crago complied with the standard of care, owed Weathersby no duty, and did not cause her injuries. Dr. Crago noted that x-rays taken the day after the test did not reveal a compression fracture but diagnosed her with a muscle spasm. He further testified regarding his compliance with the standard of care and argued that the injuries were not proximately caused by his treatment. He additionally supported his defense by pointing out that hundreds of other patients had taken the Dynatron test without injury before and after Weathersby's test.

The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and Weathersby appealed claiming that the trial court erred because the summary judgment addressed a medical malpractice claim rather than a claim of ordinary negligence.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment for Dr. Crago and MacGregor Medical Association due to the appellants' failure to prove proximate cause. The defendants negated the essential proximate cause element, which consists of cause in fact and foreseeability. Dr. Crago successfully presented undisputed evidence negating cause in fact by testifying that the treatment did not cause or contribute to Weathersby’s alleged injuries or damages. Specifically, he referenced Weathersby's medical questionnaire and her current medical conditions, asserting complications developed independently of the Dynatron test. As for foreseeability, Dr. Crago’s expert affidavit negated this prong, attesting to the safety and appropriateness of the test, the lack of previous injuries during similar tests, Weathersby’s absence of back trouble, and the passive nature of the exercise, which rendered her injuries unforeseeable. 

Since Dr. Crago and MacGregor disproved both elements of proximate cause (cause in fact and foreseeability) and as the plaintiff did not respond with a controverting affidavit under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c), the court will determine that Weathersby failed to create a fact issue on proximate cause, leading to the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of Dr. Crago or MacGregor. Therefore, Weathersby's points of error will be overruled and the trial court judgment will be affirmed.
