Background:
Rita L. Iracheta ("Iracheta") filed a products liability lawsuit against General Motors Corporation ("GM") regarding a design defect in the Toronado that she claimed caused the deaths of her two grandsons, Edgar and David, in a post-collision fuel-fed fire. The case was tried in the 49th Judicial District Court, Webb County, Texas. The accident occurred on Highway 83 between Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, when Silvandria Iracheta, the mother of Edgar and David, collided head-on with an eighteen-wheeler, resulting in an instant fatality for Silvandria and a subsequent fire that engulfed the Toronado, where both boys died. 

The central issue at trial was whether the Toronado’s fuel system contained a design defect responsible for a post-collision fuel-fed fire that ultimately caused Edgar's death (David's death was attributed to other causes). The jury concluded that a design defect caused Edgar's death and awarded actual and exemplary damages, which GM appealed. 

Evidence presented at trial supported the jury's finding of a design defect: the Toronado’s fuel system had failed during the crash, and a safer alternative design that would prevent siphoning of fuel was identified and found to be economically and technologically feasible. Witnesses testified that, based on the presence of a secondary fire and other observations, a fuel-fed fire likely resulted from siphoned gasoline following the initial crash.

Expert testimony discussed the siphoning and defects of the fuel system, as well as the conscious pain and suffering that Edgar experienced post-collision (after the 'whoosh'). The jury found in favor of the plaintiff, to which GM filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict/motion to disregard jury answers, which the trial court overruled. GM appealed the decision, raising nineteen issues including the insufficiency of evidence on the design defect, causation, conscious pain and suffering, and malice, as well as challenges related to jury instructions, jury argument, and the applicability of conformity with federal standards to the finding of malice.

Verdict:
The appellate court deliberated on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the trial and determined that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's findings. The court found that the Toronado’s fuel system indeed failed during the crash and that GM had knowledge of the problem with the fuel line. Additionally, the court deemed that low-cost measures like an anti-siphon break hole and a duck bill valve could have been implemented to eliminate the risk of fuel siphoning, which would have been economically viable and technologically feasible.

Considering the testimony regarding Edgar's conscious pain and suffering, the court inferred he was alive and conscious for a brief time post-crash, which substantiated the jury's damages award for conscious pain and suffering. The court further evaluated the evidence of GM's malice and concluded that it was both legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's findings. The appellate court upheld that GM acted with malice knowing the risk posed by the fuel system defect and the viable safety measures that could have been employed to mitigate the risk.

Finally, the appellate court considered all of GM's other arguments and found no reversible error. As such, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, thus sustaining the damages awarded by the jury to Iracheta for the actual and exemplary damages caused by the design defect that led to Edgar's death.
