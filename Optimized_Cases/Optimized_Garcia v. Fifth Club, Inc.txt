Background:
Joaquin Garcia was involved in a confrontation inside Club Rodeo, owned by Fifth Club, Inc., with a harasser who was subsequently ejected by Club Rodeo's bouncers. Approximately 45 minutes after the harasser was ejected, Garcia was shot six times in the parking lot by an unknown assailant, who Garcia believed was connected to the earlier altercation. Garcia sued Fifth Club for negligence and gross negligence, failing to provide adequate security at Club Rodeo. He claimed that Fifth Club had a duty to protect him from foreseeable criminal acts due to the nature of its business and the past history of criminal activity at the location.

Evidence included police being summoned over twenty times within the year prior to Garcia’s shooting, with fourteen calls involving violence. This included an aggravated robbery and aggravated assault, which established a pattern of criminal activity at Club Rodeo. Fifth Club was aware of such problems, as indicated by co-owner Salim Salem's deposition. Garcia's security expert pointed to various security shortcomings, including lack of coordination between bouncers and security guards, failure to patrol the parking lot, and inadequate training and surveillance.

Fifth Club filed for a no-evidence summary judgment, arguing there was no evidence of duty, breach, or proximate cause. The trial court granted Fifth Club’s motion without specifying the reason.

Verdict:
For the negligence claim, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision as Garcia has provided sufficient evidence that constitutes more than a scintilla, raising genuine issues of material fact regarding all the essential elements. Firstly, Garcia presented evidence of foreseeable crime, as indicated by the numerous and recent violent incidents reported at Club Rodeo which should have made Fifth Club aware of the potential dangers. This satisfies the foreseeability requirement for both duty and proximate cause, indicating that Fifth Club owed a legal duty to Garcia to protect him from third-party criminal actions.

Moreover, Garcia's expert provided evidence of breach by detailing the failures in Club Rodeo's security measures. For proximate cause, the expert’s opinion demonstrated a connection between Fifth Club’s security lapses and Garcia's injuries, arguing that better security could have either prevented the incident or reduced the resultant harm.

Consequently, the appellate court will find that Garcia has brought forth substantial evidence supporting his claim of negligence on the parts of duty, breach, and proximate cause, warranting a trial to fully explore these factual contentions.

On the other hand, for the gross negligence claim, the appellate court will affirm the lower court's take-nothing judgment because Garcia failed to demonstrate that Fifth Club was subjectively aware of an extreme degree of risk and nevertheless acted with conscious indifference. Gross negligence requires proof of an extreme degree of risk and the Fifth Club’s actual, subjective awareness of the risk, but the evidence doesn't suggest that the prior incidents at Club Rodeo reached the severity necessary to predict that Fifth Club was aware of the extreme risk of shooting and acted with indifference to patrons’ safety.

Hence, the appellate court will conclude that Garcia did not produce evidence satisfying the elements required for gross negligence and will agree with the lower court's decision to reject the gross negligence claim, but will allow the negligence claim to proceed to trial for further examination of the evidence.
