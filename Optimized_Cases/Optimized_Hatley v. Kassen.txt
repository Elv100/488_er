{Background: The parents of the decedent, Pennie Johnson, who was a chronic mental-health patient for nearly ten years, brought a wrongful death action against a medical center, a doctor, a nurse, and a hospital after Pennie committed suicide by stepping into traffic following her release from Parkland Hospital where she sought voluntary admission. 

The medical treatment prior to her suicide involved a Department of Public Safety officer discovering Pennie walking on the Dallas North Tollway, threatening to harm herself. The officer took her to Parkland's emergency room. At the emergency room, a nurse noted Pennie had taken medication seven times that day, which exceeded the prescribed dosage, leading to her medication being confiscated and placed in the nurses' station. Pennie subsequently asked for the return of her medication and became verbally abusive when it was not returned. 

Lisa Kassen, the charge nurse, testified that she, Dr. Kalra, and nurse Knowles jointly decided against returning the medication due to Pennie's suicidal threats. Kassen proposed returning the medication if Pennie agreed to be sent home by a taxi, but Pennie declined. Dr. Kalra, a third-year resident doctor at the medical center, evaluated Pennie and decided to discharge her based on the guidelines of a "difficult-patient file" that recommended discharge unless the patient displayed significantly different symptoms than those seen before. Pennie was denied admission and had her confiscated medication withheld, despite her threats of suicide if they were not returned. She left the hospital unescorted and approximately thirty minutes later, she was fatally struck by a truck on Interstate 35. 

The court had to review the summary judgment for the medical center and doctor, and a directed verdict for the nurse and hospital. Appellants challenged the medical providers' actions as negligence contributing to the wrongful death of their daughter, arguing that they failed to provide standard medical care and official immunity was not warranted for these medical providers. The court examined if sovereign immunity should protect these entities given the specific circumstances of the case. 

Verdict: The court reversed the summary judgment in favor of the medical center and doctor, and the directed verdict in favor of the nurse and hospital, remanding the case back to the trial court. 

The court reasoned that the expert testimony used to grant summary judgment was insufficientâ€”it did not qualify the deponent as an expert, failed to set out the applicable standard of care, and did not address the cause of damages. Moreover, the court held that Dr. Kalra and Nurse Kassen were not entitled to official immunity, reasoning that treating a patient was not an act involving governmental discretion and did not grant the nurse quasi-judicial status. The court also concluded that claims for negligence against the hospital invoked a limited waiver of sovereign immunity because it pertained to the hospital's failure to provide standard medical care. 

The decision anticipated that the appeals court found the evidence presented against both Dr. Kalra and the medical center, specifically centering on their reliance on the difficult-patient file and the failure to obtain a second opinion from a senior psychiatrist, was material and created a genuine issue of fact regarding the standard of care required and whether there had been a breach of this standard. Similarly, for Nurse Kassen and Parkland Hospital, the court maintained that their handling of the medication and the suicide threat situation led to a failure of providing appropriate care as it was not consistent with standard medical practices for such scenarios, rendering summary judgment and the directed verdict inappropriate. 

The appeals court would have noted the need for full hearings to properly address the alleged negligence and causation of Johnson's death due to the complex nature of mental health treatment and the specifics of the individual's case, leaving these issues to be sorted out back at trial.}
