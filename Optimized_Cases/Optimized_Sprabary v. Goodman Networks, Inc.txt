Background:
Danny Sprabary (Appellant), sued Goodman Networks, Inc. (Appellee) for the wrongful death of his son, alleging that Goodman was aware of his son's diabetes, and had a plan in place to contact the son's girlfriend or brother if he began to suffer from hypoglycemia or other health-related issues while working. The Appellant argued that the company failed to execute this plan on the day of his son's death. According to the Appellant, the son was scheduled to meet with a trainee at a Wal-Mart before going on a service call. The son experienced distress, which was communicated to his supervisor; however, the supervisor failed to contact the designated individuals and instructed the trainee to return the son to the Wal-Mart parking lot, where he later died.

Goodman filed a summary judgment motion, asserting there was no evidence that it owed a duty to the son, that it breached this duty, or that any such breach caused the son's death. They argued that heart disease, not diabetes or any omission on their part, was the proximate cause of death, and included deposition testimony from the medical examiner to support this claim. In response, the Appellant presented an affidavit from Dr. Marvin Pietruszka, which asserted that the son's death was proximately caused by complications related to diabetes mellitus based on autopsy findings.

The trial court struck Dr. Pietruszka's affidavit, deeming it to be conclusory and speculative without any factual explanation of how findings from the autopsy report supported a diabetes-related cause of death over heart disease. The trial court granted summary judgment for Goodman, and the Appellant appealed this decision.

Verdict:
The Appellate Court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The Appellate Court will likely hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking the affidavit of the Appellant's expert witness, Dr. Pietruszka. The Appellate Court will reason that the expert witness's opinion was speculative and conclusory, for he failed to provide a factual explanation or discussion to substantiate the claim that the son's death was caused by diabetes-related complications, as opposed to sudden adult death due to heart disease. Additionally, the Appellate Court will find that the expert witness did not effectively eliminate other possible causes of death, such as heart disease, or provide a basis for concluding that complications related to the son's diabetes mellitus were the proximate cause of death.

The Appellate Court will hold that, with the exclusion of Dr. Pietruszka's affidavit, the Appellant failed to provide more than a scintilla of evidence to show that Goodman's alleged breach of duty and the theory that the son's death was related to his diabetes rather than heart disease. As a result, the Appellant will not have met his burden to overcome the no-evidence summary judgment motion filed by Goodman. The Appellate Court will conclude that the Appellant did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged negligence of Goodman and its causal connection to the son's death. Thus, the Appellant's issues will be overruled, and the trial court's judgment in favor of Goodman will be affirmed.
