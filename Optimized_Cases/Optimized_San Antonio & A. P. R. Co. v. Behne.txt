Background:
Albert Behne and his wife initiated a legal battle against the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, seeking reparations for the death of Ed Behne, their son. Ed tragically perished in a flood when he, along with two of his brothers and an uncle, were swept away by a collapsing tree that had been struck by a railway bridge dislodged by flood waters. The railway bridge in question had been unable to withstand the force of the flood because of the company's failure to provide appropriate drainage systems within their roadbed and tracks, a requirement proscribed by Texas law under statute R. S. art. 6495. This particular case was initially decided in favor of the Behnes by both the original trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals on the principle that the company's infraction should see them liable for any ensuing injury that might have stemmed from that statutory violation. During the litigation process, substantial evidence was presented. The accident scene was described with the following geographical features: Elm Creek marked by a 4,000-foot-wide valley intersected by the railway that ran north-south, with solid embankments on either side of approximately 2,132 feet and 846 feet respectively, and a 154-foot bridge over the creek itself. The embankments had been previously breached by floods, but not the bridge until the incident in question. The place where the Behne party was fishing was accustomed to campers and fishers, with a public road traversing it, and it was recognized for its susceptibility to sudden floods. The court emphasized the statute was for the protection of individuals as well as property and non-compliance constituted a legal transgression which imposed legal responsibility for any damages directly traceable to such act or omission. However, a significant legal point of deliberation was whether the railway company's failure to adhere to the drainage statute was the direct or proximate cause of Ed Behne's death, with considerations of whether injury from such negligence was reasonably foreseeable.

Verdict:
In determining whether the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company's lack of adequate drainage was the proximate cause of Ed Behne's drowning, the court will consider that proximate cause in law requires the injury to be a foreseeable consequence of the wrongful act. The court will articulate that foreseeability is a central tenet in proximate cause and applies whether the wrongful act is a violation of a statute or a failure to meet common-law obligations. The court will underscore that foreseeability is not based on the actual anticipation of specific harm but on the reasonable anticipation that the wrongful act might result in harm. Therefore, the court will articulate its disagreement with the Court of Civil Appeals, which had previously held that violation of the statute automatically induced liability irrespective of foreseeability. Instead, the court will reiterate that civil liability is confined to injuries that are deemed to be a direct result of the wrongful conduct. By this reasoning, the court will argue that the flood that washed away the bridge, while potentially a consequence of the company's failure to provide necessary drainage, was an unusual and unforeseeable event, and so were the circumstances that led to the plaintiffs being in harm's way. The railway company's statutory violation was not within the reasonable sphere of anticipation, as nobody would typically be found in the vicinity during such a catastrophic flood. Therefore, court will conclude that the proximate cause doctrine dictates that despite the company's statutory violation contributing to the bridge collapse, the injury to Ed Behne was too remote to hold the company liable because it was a highly improbable occurrence that reasonably could not have been foreseen by the company. With this elaborate application of legal principles and consistent precedents, the court will reverse the lower court and appellate decisions, and render a judgment in favor of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company.
