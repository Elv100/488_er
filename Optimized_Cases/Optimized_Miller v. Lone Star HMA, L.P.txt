Background:

Michael E. Miller went to Dallas Regional Medical Center with abdominal pain on August 13, 2013. A CT scan indicated a gallbladder problem. The next day, Dr. George M. Hariz performed surgery on Miller, during which he inadvertently created a hole or wound in Miller's duodenum and placed a "#10 Jackson-Pratt drain" in the wound. On August 16, notwithstanding drainage of "greenish" fluid from the surgical wound, Miller was discharged from the hospital.

Miller was scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Hariz on August 23, but because he was feeling unwell and feverish, he consulted Dr. Hariz on August 21. Dr. Hariz treated Miller and asked him to return on August 23. However, Miller went to the Dallas Regional Medical Center emergency room on August 22 due to vomiting greenish fluid. After receiving unsatisfactory care, he sought treatment at another hospital where he underwent emergency surgery on August 22 and another surgery the following day. He was hospitalized for nearly a month before being discharged.

Miller subsequently sued Dr. Hariz, Lone Star HMA, L.P., and Mesquite HMA General, LLC (the appellees), claiming Dr. Hariz's negligence during surgery, the early discharge decision, and during the August 21 visit. Furthermore, he alleged the appellees' nurse employees were negligent in monitoring, treating, observing, charting, documenting, reporting, and caring for Miller post-operation.

Several months into the case, Miller settled with Dr. Hariz. Appellees later sought to strike Miller's expert witness, Dr. Brian Harkins, and filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion on causation. Miller argued against striking Harkins's testimony and the summary judgment but the trial judge struck the expert testimony and granted summary judgment for appellees. Miller's motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this appeal.

The crucial aspect under contention is whether Miller's causation expert, Dr. Harkins, provided reliable testimony that poor charting of additional information about drainage from Miller's surgical wound was a proximate cause of his injuries. There was an absence of evidence regarding what the unrecorded drainage information would have been, leaving it to speculation whether this missing information would have altered the treating physician's decision to discharge Miller. Dr. Harkins’s testimony was asserted to be conclusory, speculative, and lacking a factual basis from the record.

Verdict:

The court did not err in striking the expert because the key causation testimony from Dr. Harkins was conclusory, unsupported by facts in the record, and speculative. Causation in a medical malpractice case requires proof to a reasonable medical probability that the alleged negligence was a proximate cause of the injury. It includes two components: cause-in-fact, which involves substantial factor and "but-for" causation, and foreseeability. Harkins’s causation testimony failed to provide a detailed factual basis explaining how better documentation of drainage volumes would probably have changed Dr. Hariz's decision making. The testimony did not meet the standards for causation because it did not provide evidence that the negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injury or that without the alleged negligent act or omission, the harm would not have occurred.

In summary judgment, the nonmovant must produce evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to each challenged element. Miller failed to present any such evidence regarding causation. The court will affirm the summary judgment due to the fact that Miller did not point to any evidence that could raise a genuine issue of fact regarding causation. Miller's arguments rely on speculative assumptions not supported by the record, such as the notion that more detailed charting would have influenced Hariz's decision or that drainage volumes recorded after the fact would have affected the discharge decision. Without such evidence, the causation claim cannot stand, and thus the grant of summary judgment is proper. The trial court's judgment will be affirmed, as Miller's appeal does not present grounds that would suggest an error in the trial court's decisions.
