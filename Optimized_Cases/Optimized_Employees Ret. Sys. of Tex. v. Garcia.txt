Background:
Cynthia Garcia was employed as a prison guard at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) beginning in 2004 and was assigned to the Darrington Unit. On July 6, 2005, Garcia fell from a guard tower while on duty, sustaining serious injuries that resulted in multiple surgeries and lasting physical impairments. The guard tower, lacking air conditioning and meant for surveillance, featured a hatch cover that when opened, revealed a two-foot square opening leading to a 16-foot drop to the ground. According to procedures, the trapdoor should remain locked open only until the other guard had descended the ladder and safely reached the ground, after which it should be closed and remain so throughout the duty. However, after signaling another guard to send up ice, Garcia re-entered the tower forgetting the trapdoor was open and fell through the uncovered opening.

In light of her injuries, Garcia applied to the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS) for occupational-disability retirement benefits that are available for state employees who are "permanently incapacitated from the further performance of duty" and whose disability meets the statutory definition of an "occupational disability." The definition requires the disability to result solely from an extremely dangerous risk of severe physical or mental trauma not common to the public and peculiar to and inherent in a dangerous duty that arises from the nature and in the course of a person's state employment. ERS staff denied her application, and Garcia's appeal to ERS's Board of Trustees was referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) for a contested-case hearing.

At the hearing, it centralized on the dispute whether Garcia's fall and subsequent disability resulted solely from the extremely dangerous condition of her working environment or whether her own negligence contributed to her injury. The ALJ issued a proposal for decision (PFD) supporting Garcia's claim. However, the ERS's Executive Director on behalf of the Board, rejected the ALJ's PFD, adopting alternative findings and conclusions and ultimately denying Garcia's claim on the grounds that her injury was caused by her own negligence which did not result solely from an extremely dangerous condition of the work environment.

Verdict:
The case will likely be decided in favor of the ERS, with the judgment affirming ERS's final order denying Garcia's claim for occupational-disability retirement benefits. The ERS Executive Director's decision will be deemed within lawful discretion and consistent with the statutory definition of "occupational disability." Despite the serious injuries Garcia obtained from the fall—which are undisputed and acknowledged—her negligence in forgetting to close the trapdoor will be seen as an independent and contributing factor that prevents her disability from solely resulting from an extremely dangerous risk of her employment, which is a requisite to qualify for the benefits under the statutory definition.

The court will likely affirm that the Executive Director acted within the statutory authority by modifying the ALJ's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, provided plausible, detailed reasons for those modifications. Even though the injury occurred in the workplace and involved a feature of Garcia's working environment—the open trapdoor—her own conduct in not taking the basic safety measures of closing the trapdoor and keeping a proper lookout upon re-entering the tower will be interpreted as not being an inherent component of the extreme dangers of her duties. The ERS's interpretation of "solely" in the statute will be considered a reasonable construction, and courts are supposed to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation when the statute's language is within the agency's area of expertise, especially when it's ambiguous or leaves room for policy determination. The court will find that Garcia's failure to close the hatch and ensure that the chain was in place signified a break from the continuous risk inherent to the job and introduced an independent act of negligence on her part. Thus, while Garcia bore the risk of falling while performing her duties, her fall was ultimately not viewed as resulting "solely" from an extremely dangerous risk related to her work environment due to the presence of her own negligent actions. Consequently, the court will reverse the district court's judgment and render judgment in favor of ERS, upholding the agency's decision to deny occupational-disability retirement benefits.
