Background:
The beneficiaries, as appellees, initially filed an action against the insurer, the defendant, to recover on a policy of insurance issued to the insured, Edward MacKechnie. The policy stipulated coverage against bodily injuries from accidents and payment of a sum in case of such injuries resulting in death or permanent paralysis. MacKechnie suffered injuries and eventual death following an accident involving a fall while attempting to board a streetcar. The insurer contended that MacKechnie had signed a release and accepted a settlement under the policy, therefore nullifying the insurer's liability. However, the trial court found that MacKechnie did not have sufficient mental capacity to understand the release when he signed it, rendering the release invalid.

The insurer also raised procedural complaints regarding the beneficiaries' counsel's opening argument, which the insurer claimed went beyond the evidence and had the potential to inflame the jury against them. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the beneficiaries for the sum of $13,781.92, which included principal, interest, and attorney's fees, and ruled that Stewart MacKechnie, another plaintiff, would take nothing. The insurer appealed the decision, arguing both against the validity of the award to the beneficiaries and the conduct of their counsel during the trial.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the action for further proceedings. The appellate court will likely find that the evidence presented did indeed show that the insured, Edward MacKechnie, had suffered from an accident that led to his injuries and eventual death, and that these injuries, independent of all other causes, had continuously and wholly disabled him. However, the issue will be whether he had sufficient mental capacity to understand and enter into the settlement agreement when he signed the release for the insurer. Since the trial court concluded that he did not, the prediction is that the appellate court will uphold this aspect.

Nonetheless, the appellate court will find issues with the trial procedure, specifically the submission of special issues to the jury that combined multiple separate factual questions which should have been submitted separately, and hence, leading to potential confusion and an unfair verdict. Additionally, the appellate court will likely find that the opening argument of the beneficiaries' counsel exceeded the bounds of legitimate argument, potentially resulting in prejudice against the insurer. This inappropriate conduct, including personal criticism of opposing counsel, and remarks meant to elicit sympathy for the plaintiff's position, if not corrected promptly by the trial court, would be grounds for a reversal of the decision. The counsel's argument was not based on evidence and improperly influenced the jury, therefore the appellate court will consider this to have potentially obscured the real issues at hand. On these grounds, particularly regarding trial procedure and conduct during argument, the appellate decision will be to reverse the lower court's judgment and remand for a new trial to ensure fair consideration of the facts and proper jury deliberation free from potential prejudice and confusion.
