Background: 
Minnie Alston had cataract surgery in 1978 that resulted in the removal of her natural lenses, compromising her peripheral vision. Lens implantation was not available at that time. In April 1996, Alston, 59, sought secondary implantation of intraocular lenses in both eyes from Dr. Thomas Marvelli, a board-certified ophthalmologist specializing in lens implant procedures. He informed her of the risks including blindness and loss of the eye, and offered alternative options, but she chose the surgery.

On May 6, 1996, Dr. Marvelli performed the secondary anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation procedure on Alston's right eye using a "superior" incision at the top of the eye. The same procedure was done on her left eye in August 1996. Six months later, Alston developed complications in her right eye, which led to a series of additional surgeries conducted by Dr. Marvelli. Despite initially successful results after each surgery, repeated dislocations of the lens occurred, which Dr. Marvelli attributed to Alston rubbing her eyes, and a history of drinking and smoking.

Alston's right eye experiences included a tilted lens, tearing of the iris tissue, dislocation through an iridectomy opening, and a diagnosis of a wound leak with epithelial downgrowth which is when skin cells grow into the eye and can destroy it. Attempts to save the eye by other specialists failed, and her right eye had to be removed and replaced with a prosthetic on January 9, 1999. 

Dr. Marvelli’s repeated surgeries went through the same incision site or slightly different ones, with his technique being questioned by Alston's expert witness, Dr. Norman Jaffe, as breaching the standard of care. Dr. Jaffe opined that a horizontal, rather than vertical, placement of the haptics loops on the implant, entering from the side and not from the top, would have reduced the chance of dislocation of the lens, which he believed led to the multiple surgeries and the eventual loss of Alston's eye. 

The case proceeded to a jury trial, and the jury concluded both Alston's and Dr. Marvelli's negligence were a proximate cause of the loss of her right eye, assigning 75% responsibility to Dr. Marvelli and 25% to Alston. They awarded her $100,000 for past damages and $850,000 for future damages. 

Dr. Marvelli appealed, arguing that the expert's testimonies were based on incorrect assumptions, that Dr. Jaffe’s testimonies were scientifically unreliable, improperly based on a "loss of chance" doctrine not recognized in Texas, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the award for future damages.

Verdict:
The appeal court framed its reasoning, assuming that Dr. Marvelli's first three issues, asserting that Dr. Jaffe's expert opinion testimony was not probative evidence of causation, would be overruled. Considering Texas law, the court would find that while Dr. Jaffe's testimony occasionally referenced "chance," the substance of his testimony argued a "series of probabilities" that sufficiently established causation under a "reasonable medical probability." The court would determine that his opinions did not invoke the loss of chance doctrine because the record wouldn't show a preexisting condition in Alston making the ultimate harm improbable before any negligence by Dr. Marvelli. Thus, his opinion would be deemed legally sufficient to establish cause-in-fact. 

On the assertion that Dr. Jaffe's opinions constituted no more than ipse dixit, the court would consider Dr. Jaffe's extensive qualifications, peer-reviewed publications, and authoritative textbooks on the subject, ultimately determining that his opinions were based on a reliable scientific basis that rose above mere conjecture or speculation.

For Dr. Marvelli's ninth issue, concerning the future damages awarded, the court would hold the jury's determination as not excessive. It would emphasize that the judgment was within the realm of the jury's broad discretion for personal injury damages, given the evidence showing Alston's ongoing pain, disfigurement, embarrassment from her prosthetic eye, and that she would likely continue to experience these issues permanently.

Regarding the new trial motion based on the threats allegation and newly discovered evidence, like testimony from Beverly, Amanda, and Tima, the court would find no merit in Dr. Marvelli's contentions. The pretrial knowledge of Beverly Siefkas would mean due diligence was not exercised to bring forth her testimony earlier. As to Amanda Siefkas and Tima Wyatt, the testimony would be judged as cumulative and unlikely to produce a different result, thereby not meeting the requirements for granting a new trial based on new evidence. The alleged threats would not change this assessment because it would not be apparent that the exclusion of these testimonies was erroneous or had materially affected the trial's outcome.

Overall, the appellate court would affirm the judgment of the trial court, dismissing Dr. Marvelli's assertions of error and supporting the original jury verdict for future physical and mental suffering.
