Background:
Juli Bliskey, the appellee, resided at Wilderock Townhomes in Corpus Christi, Texas. She experienced a traumatic sexual assault in her townhome perpetrated by an intruder who gained entry using a key to her front door. The assailant informed Bliskey that he had obtained her key and lease information by breaking into the property management office of Wilderock Townhomes. He searched resident files for single women with good jobs and found Bliskey's information, corresponding her lease with her clearly identified apartment key, which he took from a pegboard displaying all the residents' keys.

Bliskey subsequently sued various entities, including the owners of her specific townhome, other Berry entities, and their owner, Annette Berry, for negligence and deceptive trade practices under Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. ยง 17.43 (1987). She claimed that Berry Property Management, Inc. (appellant), as one of the managers, negligently handled its residents' keys and violated the DTPA by failing to provide appropriate door locks as required by statute and promised by the lease. The jury found in favor of Bliskey, awarding both compensatory and punitive damages. Both sides filed post-verdict motions, but the final judgment awarded damages to Bliskey based on the verdict, subject to modifications regarding attorneys' fees and interest. The trial court overruled appellant's motion for a new trial. Appellant contested the judgment, and Bliskey cross-appealed on issues related to attorneys' fees.

Notably, while in prison, the assailant had managed to escape but was quickly recaptured and returned to jail. This escape factored into the case in terms of exacerbating Bliskey's mental anguish and affecting the resulting damages. Initially, questions regarding jury size arose when one juror was excused after expressing concern about potential bias due to a personal connection with an insurance agent involved with a defendant Berry entity. However, the trial proceeded with eleven jurors, as minimal jurors' impairment was considered, and the verdict was rendered unanimously.

Verdict:
In predicting the verdict of Bliskey's lawsuit against Berry Property Management for negligence, the court will likely affirm the judgment for appellee, Bliskey, finding sufficient evidence to support the jury's determination that Berry's negligent handling of keys led to her assault. The court will address the components of negligence: duty, breach, and proximate cause.

The court will ascertain that Berry owed a duty of reasonable care based on foreseeable risk due to the management policy of having keys to tenants' exterior door locks. It will be concluded that the jury reasonably found Berry's storage methods of residents' keys and files provided an unreasonable risk of harm that was foreseeable. This conclusion will be bolstered by expert testimony acknowledging the inadequacy of Berry's security measures and the acknowledgment by Annette Berry that such assaults do occur and are foreseeable.

On causation, Bliskey will need to show Berry's conduct was a "but for" cause of her harm and that Berry should have anticipated the danger created by its negligence. The court will reject Berry's argument that the criminal's conduct was an unforeseeable superseding cause, finding instead that Berry's mismanagement of keys and rental information was sufficiently concerning to foresee potential criminal misuse.

In addressing the deceptive trade practices claim, Berry's argument that Bliskey failed to prove a misleading act or practice relating to the lease agreement and security devices will not prevail, as the court will find the lease represented an obligation to provide a night latch upon request, which was not fulfilled.

Berry's contention that there cannot be double recovery of actual and punitive damages under both common law and the DTPA for the same act will fail, as the court will find that separate and distinct damages were assessed for Berry's negligence and deceptive acts, justifying distinct awards for each. The jury's decision to award attorneys' fees as a percentage of damages will be deemed appropriate, ensuring Bliskey's recovery is not diminished by legal expenses.

Ultimately, the court will modify the judgment to eliminate the double recovery of prejudgment interest on attorneys' fees but will uphold the remaining judgment based on ample evidence supporting the findings of negligence and deception. The court will also require the application of the co-defendants' settlement to be before calculating prejudgment interest. Berry's federal constitutional due process rights and Texas constitutional excessive fines claim regarding punitive damages will not be found to have been violated, and the punitive damages assessed will be considered reasonable based on the circumstances of the case.
