Background:
The case involves an action initiated by the plaintiff, the estate of a deceased employee, Ruben A. Short, against the defendant, a railroad company, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA, 45 U.S.C.S. §§ 51-59). The employee was killed in a train crash near Eagle Ford, Texas. The engineer operating the train, T. B. Petty, had not qualified according to the company’s rules before taking charge of the engine. The employee inaccurately informed the engineer that the turnout was just west of Dallas when it was actually just west of Eagle Ford. The train approached a curved track at the turnout at an excessive speed, leading to the crash. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the estate after finding that the railroad company was negligent on multiple counts, including failing to ensure the engineer qualified, running the train at a dangerous speed, not informing the engineer about a track change, not maintaining a signboard to indicate the curve, and providing incorrect information in a time-table. The jury also found the employee’s failure to read a bulletin board about the turnout's location to not be contributory negligence and not the proximate cause of the injury. The trial court's refusal to submit the issue of the employee’s assumption of risk to the jury was considered harmless error.

Verdict:
In predicting the outcome, the Verdict will likely affirm the decision of the trial court, citing several reasons. The court will probably rule that contributory negligence was not conclusively established as a matter of law, and therefore, a peremptory instruction would not be justified. The employee's failure to read a bulletin about the turnout location will not constitute contributory negligence because foreseeing injury from such omission as a matter of law is unjustifiable. The court will also dismiss the argument that the employee’s incorrect statement to the engineer about the turnout location was a proximate cause of the crash, as the mistake did not demonstrate a failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. Additionally, because the employee stated he did not have knowledge of the turnout location, the court will likely find no duty on his part to have known its exact position.

Regarding assumed risk, the court will possibly determine there was no issue to submit to the jury since at least one of the negligence grounds was not associated with assumed risk evidence. Specifically, the failure to maintain a warning sign was not an assumed risk, as the employee had no knowledge of the turnout location. In addition, the court will likely conclude any error in refusing to submit the issue of assumed risk to the jury would be inconsequential.

On the issue of warnings about proximate cause, the court will probably rule that its definition as "efficient and producing cause but for which the injury would not have happened and which could have been reasonably foreseen as causing the injuries complained of, or some similar injury" was adequate. The court is anticipated to find explanations for the meaning of legal terms like "efficient cause" and "efficient and producing cause" unnecessary for the jury to render their verdict, and that such terms do not differ in their legal connotation from their common understanding.

Unless an argument or error could be definitively identified as having influenced the outcome of the trial, the court will likely not reverse judgment on the grounds of improper argument or action by the trial court or counsel. Thus, the verdict will probably conclude that no reversible error has been demonstrated, and as a result, the court's decision will be to affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
