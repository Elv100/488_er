Background:
Linda Faust and Donnie Faust, the plaintiffs in this case, sued BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), alleging that BNSF's negligence at its wood treatment facility in Somerville, Texas, caused their personal injuries and damages, including Linda's stomach cancer. The Fausts lived and worked near the Somerville Tie Plant, where Donnie came into contact with creosote, a chemical used in wood treatment, as part of his job since 1974. Linda, having worked in various jobs near the plant, had also been exposed to the facility's emissions.

The plant, which was operational 24/7 and had been run by BNSF's predecessor since 1905, treated wood with a mixture of creosote and oil. Waste generated included drainage from treatment cylinders, kickback from treated ties, treated wood slats, sawdust, boiler emissions, wastewater, and atmospheric emissions. The plant's waste management and disposal methods were contentious issues at trial.

The Fausts claimed BNSF negligently allowed the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, causing continuous exposure and contamination, resulting in injuries and property damage. Linda had smoked cigarettes for twenty-five years, between half and a full pack daily, experienced gastrointestinal symptoms since the early 1980s, and was diagnosed with diffuse signet cell stomach cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection in 1998.

They cited substantial evidence to support their claims, including expert testimony on BNSF's alleged negligence in operating the plant and handling waste, pollution, and employee safety.

The defendants presented contrary evidence for each point the plaintiffs brought up. Specifically, they challenged the calculation of waste burned in the plant's boilers, the amount of drainage after treatment, and the daily burning of kickback and treated wood. They also disputed the need for and efficacy of an incinerator for waste disposal, which the plaintiffs claimed BNSF was negligent for not having.

Verdict:
Upon appeal, it will be likely predicted that the court would affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of BNSF based on a number of factors assessed in the appeal. The court will find no error with the specific causation instruction provided to the jury, meaning the jury's charge to exclude with reasonable certainty other plausible causes for Linda Faust's cancer, such as smoking and H. pylori infection, was appropriate. The jurors, as factfinders, were rightly instructed that other potential causes for Linda's stomach cancer had to be reasonably excluded in order to establish specific causation for exposure from the Somerville Tie Plant.

Moreover, the court will probably conclude that the evidence was factually sufficient to support the jury's determination. Given the conflicting evidence about how much toxic waste was actually burned in the boilers, the variations in the quantities of chemicals emitted during treatment processes, the amount of waste produced, the protective measures offered to employees, and other factors, the jury could have reasonably found that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proof on negligence. As such, it was likely within the jury's prerogative to reject the claim that BNSF's negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of Linda's cancer, particularly in light of the multiple other possible factors contributing to her condition.

The court will see no merit in the arguments that the trial court shifted its gatekeeper function regarding expert testimony admission to the jury, nor that the instruction given was an impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence. The instruction did not mislead the jury or place the judge's responsibility on them.

It will be observed that under the applicable legal standards, including the need to establish both general and specific causation, the jury was correctly guided to consider whether plaintiffs had excluded other potential causes of Linda's cancer with reasonable certainty. In affirming the trial court, the decision will rest on principles of evidentiary sufficiency and proper jury instruction, finding that the trial court did not err in its approach or its ultimate determination.

Given the detailed and complex evidence presented during the trial, with expert opinions conflicting on key issues, it was the juryâ€™s province to resolve these conflicts. The appellate court, therefore, will be expected to defer to the jury's findings on factual disputes, especially where the evidence was sufficiently balanced to support the verdict reached.
