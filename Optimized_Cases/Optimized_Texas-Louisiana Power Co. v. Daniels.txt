Background:
On the night of May 13, 1929, three men, Doc Franklin Webster, Tom Webster, and Bowen Daniels, were killed by coming in contact with a downed power line belonging to the Texas-Louisiana Power Company. The line had been struck by lightning about 18 hours earlier, three miles south of Bells, in Grayson county, Texas. Bowen Daniels' mother, Mrs. N.E. Daniels, filed a lawsuit against the power company, claiming that negligence on the part of the power company had caused her son’s death. She was awarded $7,500 in damages by the trial court.

The power company appealed the verdict, arguing that the court made errors, including refusing to give its requested instructions on the issue of actionable negligence. The power company was statutorily obligated to maintain its power lines 22 feet above the ground per Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 1436 (1925) and also had a duty to exercise reasonable care in inspecting and addressing dangerous conditions. Due to the lines being low to the ground for an extended period, a presumption of negligence was placed upon the power company, which they completely failed to rebut. The jury found the power company was guilty of negligence by allowing its wires to remain low, failing to have a watchman present, and keeping its wires charged with electricity while they hung near the ground. These findings encompassed the fact that the company knew, or should have known, about the hazardous state of the lines.

Moreover, the company argued that Bowen Daniels was a trespasser and thus not owed a duty of care, that his death was the result of an act of God, or that it was an unavoidable accident. They also contended that Daniels had entered the property for an illegal purpose (theft), which should preclude liability. The court dismissed these arguments. The power company also raised the issue of contributory negligence, listing several acts of Daniels that might have contributed to his death (such as entering at night without a light and not asking for a guide), but the court found that contributory negligence was not applicable as Daniels and his companions were unaware of the dangerous condition of the power line or its existence.

Verdict:
The appellate court, in affirming the lower court's judgment, will hold that the power company's arguments are unavailing. The appellate court will find that due to statutory obligations placed upon the power company to maintain its lines at a certain height and the extended period for which the dangerous condition was allowed to persist, a presumption of negligence adequately arose. The power company will fail to provide evidence that overcomes this presumption by demonstrating it exercised reasonable care.

Additionally, the appellate court will reject the power company's contention relating to the supposed contributory negligence of Bowen Daniels. The appellate court will reason that since Daniels and his companions were ignorant of the presence and danger of the power line, there was no duty to exercise care that would otherwise be required if one were aware of such danger. The court will further elaborate that the issue of contributory negligence did not factor into this case since Daniels’ lack of awareness and expectation of the power line indicated no breach of duty for self-protection on his part.

The power company's attempt to argue that specific acts of Daniels constituted contributory negligence will be dismissed because these acts were not related to the condition of the lines, as Daniels was unaware of the hazards. The appellate court's decision will also rest on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows an inference of negligence when an accident of this type would not ordinarily occur if those who manage the situation had exercised proper care. Given the explicit statutory requirement and the condition of the lines being clearly observable, the power company’s failure to address the situation will be viewed as a breach of its duty of care.

In conclusion, the appellate court will affirm the trial court’s judgment in favor of Mrs. N.E. Daniels, and the power company's appeal will be denied, resulting in the power company being held liable for the death of Bowen Daniels.
