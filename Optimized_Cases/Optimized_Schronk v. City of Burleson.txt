Background:
Kevin Schronk and his son Dustin filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Burleson and Laerdal Medical Corporation after emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the city-employed emergency services could not revive Kevin's wife, Helen, using an AED made by Laerdal. On the incident day, the AED failed because the battery was insufficiently charged to deliver the necessary defibrillating shock, despite several attempts leading to Helen's death.

The survivors charged the City with negligence due to the improper AED maintenance and violations of statutes related to emergency service providers, specifically Texas Health & Safety Code Ann. § 779.003. They contended that Laerdal was negligent in various aspects of manufacturing, marketing, and labeling the AED, as well as in training City staff on its operation and maintenance. They also asserted product liability claims against Laerdal, alleging the AED was unreasonably dangerous.

The City responded with a plea to the jurisdiction, arguing sovereign immunity and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction as the City had not waived this immunity. Laerdal filed a motion for summary judgment claiming there was no evidence for the claims against it and that the AED was not defective or a contributing factor to Helen's death. The trial court granted the City's plea to jurisdiction, Laerdal's motion for summary judgment, and sustained the City's objections to some evidence offered by the Schronks.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision, including the grant of the City's plea to the jurisdiction and Laerdal's motion for summary judgment. Concerning the plea to jurisdiction, the appellate court will find that the trial court erred because there exist disputed material facts regarding whether the City's use of the AED was a proximate cause of Helen's death, and whether the City failed to comply with applicable emergency action laws. Specifically, it will highlight evidence suggesting the City may have violated statutes by not adhering to the manufacturer's maintenance guidelines, thus removing the City from the exceptions of sovereign immunity protection under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Ann. §§ 101.055(2) and 101.062(b).

Regarding the summary judgment in favor of Laerdal, the appellate court will find that genuine issues of material fact remain about whether the AED and its battery were defective—factoring in potential AED malfunctions and mislabeled battery replacement dates—and whether Laerdal's supposed negligence in advising battery lifespans and failing to label batteries correctly could have proximately caused Helen Schronk's death. The court will discount Laerdal's contentions that Dr. Reese's affidavit is not substantiated because the affidavit, according to the court, is based on types of data reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.

Therefore, the case will be remanded back to the trial court for further proceedings, taking into account the evidence suggesting potential proximate causes for Helen Schronk's death tied to the City and Laerdal's actions or failures to act.
