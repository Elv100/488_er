Background:
H.T. Staggs was an employee of Skelly Oil Company, supervised and repaired the company's pumping plant engines, and lived on the company's property. He worked almost all night on October 31, 1935, and returned home the next morning. After eating breakfast, he descended the steps of his home, fell, and hit his head on a concrete block. Despite the fall, he proceeded to the pumping plant for work. Later that morning, after failing to respond to a call from the superintendent, Staggs was discovered dead on the pumping plant's office floor. 

The widow filed a lawsuit seeking workmen's compensation, alleging that Staggs' fall and the subsequent inhalation of carbon monoxide gas from a leaked engine at the pumping plant contributed to his death. An autopsy indicated the death was due to cerebral hemorrhage caused by high blood pressure and pre-existing conditions, which a physician believed could have existed for months or years. A physician for the defense opined that the injury from the fall contributed to the death, a conclusion that the Court of Civil Appeals found supportable based on the jury's finding.

The jury found that Staggs fell and injured his head, which contributed to his death, and that the injury happened in the course of employment. Additionally, they determined he had inhaled carbon monoxide gas, sustaining injury from it which also contributed to his death whilst in the domain of his employment.

The Court of Civil Appeals concluded there was no evidence for the carbon monoxide inhalation contributing to his death. Plaintiff in error argued for a requirement of evidence supporting both causes (fall and gas) contributing to the death, whereas the defendants in error contended that evidence for head injury as a cause was sufficient for compensation.

Texas compensation law does not demand showings of injury as the sole cause of disability/death or that it proximately caused death. Compensation law broadly covers "producing cause" of injury leading to disability or death in the employment context. The statutory and legal context defends compensation even when an injury contributes to disability/death alongside an existing disease or second injury.

Verdict:
The court's judgment will be in favor of the widow's claim for her husband's death. It will be concluded that, while the evidence surrounding the carbon monoxide poisoning does not support the cause of death, it is not material to the compensation claim as long as there is evidence to support the finding that the head injury was a producing cause of death.

The verdict will center on the notion of "producing cause," implying compensation law does not require sole causation but rather an injury's contribution as a causative factor. The jury's findings that the injury from the head injury was a producing cause of death, independent of the findings about carbon monoxide poisoning, are sufficient to uphold the compensation claim.

The court will recognize the established legal principle that in common-law negligence cases, as well as in workers' compensation claims, multiple contributing causes do not negate the responsibility of each contributing factor. The jury's findings that the head injury was a producing cause of death and occurred in the course of Staggs's employment provide an adequate legal basis for compensation, despite other non-supported findings related to carbon monoxide. The court will disregard the findings related to the gas as they are not supported by evidence, and the remaining valid findings will suffice to award compensation to the plaintiff, reflecting the broader purpose of the workers' compensation law to provide relief for employment-related injuries regardless of other concurrent causes.

Additionally, the court's reasoning will align with previous case law that endorses compensation awards where pre-existing conditions or multiple injuries contribute to the resultant harm. The concept of concurrent causation will be pivotal, confirming that the law aims to address the realities of compound factors in workplace injuries and the actual contribution of employment-related harm.
