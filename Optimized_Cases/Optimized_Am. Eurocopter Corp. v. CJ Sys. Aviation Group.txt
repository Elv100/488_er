Background:
On October 16, 2000, a helicopter owned by Duke University Medical Center and operated by CJ Systems Aviation Group (CJ), crashed due to the main rotor gearbox failure after roughly three and half hours of operation post overhaul. The gearbox had been overhauled by American Eurocopter Corporation (American). Following the crash, multiple lawsuits were pursued: the family of the deceased pilot sued American; Duke University's insurer sued American for the helicopter loss; and American settled with the pilot's family for $2,250,000. American then initiated a third-party suit against CJ for contractual indemnity to recover the settlement amount and attorney's fees from the previous cases. Additionally, American sought indemnification for defective work done by CJ. CJ counterclaimed for breach of warranty regarding the failed gearbox. The jury found that while CJ's work resulted in a loss to American, CJ's negligence was not solely responsible for the crash. They also found that American's negligence proximately caused the accident. On CJ's warranty claim, the jury found American breached the warranty and CJ's damages were $78,935.62. The trial court rendered judgment denying American's claims against CJ and awarding CJ on its breach of warranty claim.

Verdict:
The appeals court predicts the judgment will be affirmed based on several key considerations. The jury's finding that American's negligence was a proximate cause of the accident will stand because the evidence sufficiently indicates that American could have foreseen the actions of CJ's mechanic and pilot operating the aircraft with the oil-pressure warning light illuminated, given the general industry practices. Furthermore, the court will note that the gearbox's imminent failure, due to American's negligence, remained a persistent danger that did not come to rest with the aircraft's safe landing during the crash night.

Regarding the indemnity agreement, the court will determine that the express negligence doctrine applies, meaning any agreement to indemnify for one's own negligence must be stated in clear and unambiguous terms within the contract. The indemnity clause does not clearly and unequivocally require CJ to indemnify American for its own negligence or their concurrent negligence, thus barring American's claim for indemnity. The court will find that American's argument that it is seeking indemnification for consequences of CJ's negligence, not its own, is not persuasive because both parties' negligence contributed to the crash.

On the breach of warranty issue, the court will rule that evidence substantiates CJ's claim that flying the aircraft with the warning light off did not violate the warranty's terms. American's contention that CJ was not entitled to monetary damages because the warranty exclusively limited recovery to repair or replacement will be deemed waived because American did not object to the damages question or CJ's failure to obtain a jury finding on the limitation of remedy's failing of its essential purpose. There is, moreover, some evidence that the warranty's limitation of remedy did indeed fail of its essential purpose, as the gearbox could not be returned for repair or replacement due to its destruction in the crash.

The court will predict that all of American's issues on appeal will be overruled, leading to the affirmation of the trial court's judgment in favor of CJ Systems Aviation Group.
