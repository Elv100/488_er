Background:
Petitioner decedent's survivors (Mrs. Patricia Biggers and her children) filed an action against respondents (Continental Bus Company, bus driver Jack Lanham, other driver Betty Joe Epps Gross, and her husband) for damages resulting from a collision between the decedent’s automobile, driven by Enoch A. Biggers, Jr., and a passenger bus. The case came to trial, and the jury found the bus driver guilty of negligence leading to the collision, awarding damages to the plaintiffs. However, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed this judgment in part, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing against the bus company on the grounds that none of the negligent acts of the bus driver was a proximate cause of the collision. This verdict was affirmed by a previous judgment of the Supreme Court. 

The decisive event occurred on December 20, 1951, at about 8:52 a.m. on Highway 75 near Huntsville, Texas. The decedent, Enoch A. Biggers, Jr., was killed when his vehicle was hit from behind by a car driven by Betty Joe Epps (now Gross), propelling his car into the path of an oncoming bus, driven by Jack Lanham and owned by Continental Bus Company. Three vehicles had been proceeding in a southbound direction - first, a Hudson car; second, the Ford driven by Mr. Biggers; and third, the Chevrolet driven by Mrs. Gross. The collision occurred as the Hudson car slowed down near a bridge to check the fishing conditions, causing Mr. Biggers to brake and Mrs. Gross to lose control of her vehicle, impacting the rear of Mr. Biggers’ Ford and propelling it into the opposite lane where the bus was traveling northbound.

The bus driver was found negligent by the jury for failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to apply brakes, driving at an excessive rate of speed, and driving at a speed in excess of 55 miles per hour. Each act of negligence was found to be a proximate cause of the collision. The bus driver was not found to have been acting in an emergency created by other than his own negligence, and the driver of the Hudson was absolved of all charges of negligence. The collision was not deemed an unavoidable accident. Mrs. Gross was found guilty of certain negligent acts each of which was also found to be a proximate cause of the collision. Biggers was absolved of all charges of negligence and he was found to have acted in an emergency after the Ford was hit by the Chevrolet. Liabilities connected to discovered peril were dismissed as it was concluded there was no opportunity for the bus driver to avoid the collision after discovering the peril of the deceased.

The trial court awarded the plaintiffs damages against Continental and Mrs. Gross and her husband, jointly and severally, and denied the bus company and Mrs. Gross any indemnity against each other.

On appeal, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the trial court judgment as regards the bus company stating that there was no evidence of proximate cause and the plaintiffs were therefore entitled to nothing from Continental Bus Company. It was upon this background that the outcome, that follows, was to be predicated.

Verdict:
The ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals that exonerated the bus company will be reversed if there is any evidence of probative value in the record supporting any one of the findings of proximate cause. The court will disregard any evidence in the analysis that does not support the jury’s findings and will focus solely on the evidence that supports the verdict, as per the established boundaries of duty imposed by decisions of the Supreme Court.

A finding of proximate cause necessitates both foreseeability and causation. Continental's contention that foreseeability is absent in this case because an operator of an automobile cannot be required to foresee that another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction may enter the wrong traffic lane is rejected based on prior case law establishing that excessive speed, when encountering another automobile even if it were in the wrong traffic lane, could stand as a proximate cause of a collision. It is not beyond reason for a driver to anticipate that a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction may enter the wrong traffic lane, even if the entry is due to non-negligent reasons such as skidding on a wet roadway or because of being struck by another vehicle.

Addressing the argument that the bus driver is not reasonably expected to foresee the specific circumstances that led the Ford to be propelled into his lane, the Supreme Court precedent establishes that it is adequate for liability if, as a person of ordinary intelligence, he should have reasonably anticipated the danger created by his negligence, without needing to foresee the exact manner of the injury resultantly. There is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the excessive speed at which the bus was traveling was a proximate cause of the collision.

The contention that the collision would have happened regardless of the bus's speed can be found not compounds given the evidence shows an excessive speed would have limited the driver's ability to take evasive actions or stop the bus. Factoring the estimated speeds of the vehicles and the distances covered and aligning them with the time calculated, a reasonable jury could conclude that had the bus been traveling at a lawful and non-negligent speed, the collision might have been averted.

Given the established duty to operate a vehicle at a reasonable speed considering the circumstances and that a chain of cars was approaching, it is likely concluded that the reactions required by the bus driver could only have been achieved at a lower speed, thus asserting that the bus’s excessive speed did contribute to the collision and hence holds the requisite qualities of a proximate cause. It is irrelevant to Continental's liability that Mrs. Gross's negligence also contributed to the accident, assuming it fulfills the criterion of a substantial factor in bringing about the collision, as it certainly seems to do.

The Court of Civil Appeals’ judgment in favor of Continental must be reversed because it rested on the ground that as a matter of law none of the bus driver's negligent acts was a proximate cause, which is contradictory to what is supported by evidence of probative force. Additionally, the Court of Civil Appeals should be directed to consider the other points of error raised by Continental that were not considered because of the court's conclusion on the "no evidence" issue. As regards the bus company's additional point of error regarding the jury's verdict being so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong, this will need due consideration by the Court of Civil Appeals, with the proper approach being the independent evaluation of the evidence on this point, unimpaired by the court's conclusion on the lack of proximate cause. If the evidence is found lacking, a reversal and remand for retrial might be in order.

Consequently, it is probable that the Supreme Court will set aside its prior judgment affirming the appellate court's judgment, reverse the appellate court's judgment reversing the trial court's judgment for the survivors, and remand to the appellate court for further proceedings consistent with these logical deductions and analyses. Mrs. Gross's application for relief will likely be found without merit and thus denied.
