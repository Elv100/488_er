Background:
The case stems from a dispute over a subcontract bid for electrical work to be completed as part of a larger wastewater treatment plant improvement project in Bowie County, Texas, by TexAmericas Center. Heritage Constructors, Inc. (Heritage), was vying to become the general contractor for the project, which was anticipated to span nineteen months. Electric’s last-minute bid, which did not mention Heritage, was lower than other bids Heritage had received. After Heritage used Electric’s bid to become the prime contractor, Electric withdrew their bid, leading Heritage to accept the next lowest bid at a higher price.

During the bid collection process, Carl Smith, Heritage's vice president, received a bid from Electrique Corporation for $886,400.00 and later a lower bid from Chrietzberg Electric, Inc. (Electric) for $704,857.00 excluding concrete work. Carl confirmed this bid over the phone and upon Heritage being awarded the contract for the project, engaged with Electric for value engineering and additional quotes for concrete work. Electric, however, deemed that the duct bank concrete work's price by Heritage was excessive and opted to perform it themselves. Heritage then informed Electric of the project award, and Electric responded positively. When the contract was formally sent to Electric, there were discrepancies regarding the exclusion of the duct bank concrete work. Subsequently, Electric withdrew its bid, and Heritage was forced to contract with Electrique Corporation at the higher price.

Heritage sued Electric on claims of breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation, along with suing Chrietzberg, individually, for the same minus breach of contract. The jury found in favor of Heritage against Electric on the breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation claims, and awarded damages of $50,000.00 for breach/promissory estoppel but none for negligent misrepresentation. The jury found no liability for Chrietzberg individually. Heritage filed motions to disregard the jury's answers due to the assertion of exact financial loss, but the trial court denied these motions and entered a judgment favoring Chrietzberg individually and favoring Heritage against Electric with damages and attorney fees awarded. Electric filed for judgment non obstante veredicto, contesting any existence of contract and citing the statute of frauds, a lack of evidence supporting damages for breach of contract, or promissory estoppel, and challenged the award of attorney fees.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the take-nothing judgment favoring Chrietzberg and the denial of Heritage's claims for negligent misrepresentation. They will reverse the judgment favoring Heritage and issue a take-nothing judgment, as Heritage's claim for breach of contract is barred by the statute of frauds; there is no evidence of damages recoverable based on promissory estoppel; the denial of Heritage's claims for negligent misrepresentation is correct; and Heritage's recovery of attorney fees also fails.

Reasoning for these conclusions will focus on several legal points. First, the statute of frauds bars the breach of contract claim, as the alleged contract could not be completed within one year from making the agreement; it required a written agreement to be enforceable, which was lacking in this case. Given the agreement's terms and the nature of the required acts, Heritage failed to establish that the agreement was outside the scope of the statute of frauds. 

Second, on promissory estoppel, Heritage was unable to provide evidence of damages other than those unobtainable under the unenforceable contract, meaning they could not support their claim for additional, distinct damages based on promissory estoppel.

Third, related to claims of negligent misrepresentation against Electric, Heritage failed to offer evidence of any economic injuries independent of its alleged contractual damages, rendering the claim invalid. Similarly, regarding Chrietzberg's individual liability, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that any misrepresentation was on behalf of Electric, not Chrietzberg as an individual, given how Electric's estimate was formulated and the evidence concerning who was involved in creating and submitting the bid.

Lastly, Heritage is not entitled to attorney fees as they did not prevail on a valid contract claim and are not authorized by statute or by the parties' agreement to collect such fees in this context.

Therefore, Heritage would have none of its claims upheld, and the court would render a take-nothing judgment on the breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims against Electric and would also not award any attorney fees to Heritage.
