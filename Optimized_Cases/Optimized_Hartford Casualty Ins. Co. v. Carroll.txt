Background:
The case involves an insured (appellee) who filed a lawsuit against his insurance company (appellant) following a dispute over damage claims. The appellee's water well was damaged by lightning, and upon contacting the insurer's agent, he was instructed to fix the well and submit the bill for reimbursement. The appellee carried out the repairs and presented the bill, but the insurer denied the claim, stating there was no definitive proof that lightning caused the well to fail. The appellee then filed suit to recover the damages under the insurance policy, claiming a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), which allows for treble damages in cases of deceptive practices. A jury verdict found in favor of the appellee, awarding him damages under the insurance policy, treble damages under the DTPA, plus attorney fees.

The case hinges on whether or not the appellee qualifies as a "consumer" as defined by the DTPA, based on the transactions between the appellee and the insurer's agent. The agent's instructions to fix the well and submit the bill for damages, which were later denied by the insurance company, form the basis of the appellee's claim for a DTPA violation. It is contested whether the agreement by the agent added to the liability of the insurance company under the policy and whether this constitutes a service or good acquired by purchase or lease, relevant to the “consumer” definition under the DTPA.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's decision partially, recognizing that the appellee is entitled to the damages awarded for the cost of repairs to his water well, which is covered by the insurance policy. This affirmation will be based on the jury's finding that the reasonable cost of repairs was $2,735 and the lack of specific error directed at the damages submission pertaining to the cost of repairs in the jury instruction.

However, the court will reverse the award for treble damages under the DTPA. Future analysis will focus on the definition of "consumer" within the DTPA, particularly Section 17.45 which specifies that a consumer must seek or acquire goods or services by purchase or lease. Since the agreement by the insurer's agent to pay the bill did not involve the appellee seeking or acquiring additional goods or services beyond the existing insurance policy, the court will likely find that the appellee does not fit within the statutory definition of a consumer with regard to the DTPA provision. Thus, even though the appellee suffered damages, those damages will not be multiplied under the DTPA as there were no deceptive practices involved with respect to the initial procurement of services or goods. Instead, the dispute arose from the implementation of the existing contract, which does not qualify him for additional protection or remedies under the DTPA.

As a result, while the costs of the water well repair will be upheld, no treble damages will be awarded for the alleged deceptive trade practices, and the appellee will take nothing for this part of his claim. 

Attorney fees will be adjusted, with the court significantly reducing the attorney fees awarded by the trial court, except for the $150 awarded on the Motion for Sanctions, which remains unchallenged. The costs of the appeal, having partially affirmed and partially reversed the trial court's judgment, will be divided equally between the parties.
