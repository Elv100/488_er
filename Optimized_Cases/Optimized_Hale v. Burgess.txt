Background:
The appellant driver, Stanley Gene Hale, was involved in a car accident in Dallas County, Texas, where he collided with Jerome Leon Scruggs's vehicle. The accident occurred on Central Expressway near the University Boulevard Overpass around 1:00 A.M. The weather was clear, and the location was well-lit. Following the impact, Scruggs's Chevrolet was flipped upside down, and Hale's Oldsmobile was blocking the right lane. At the time of the collision, Hale was under the influence of alcohol and later pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated. Appellee rescuer D. L. Burgess, a Dallas Police Department officer, responded to the accident scene. Attempting to prevent further accidents, Burgess directed incoming traffic around the collision site. During this effort, Burgess was struck by another vehicle and sustained serious injuries. He sued Hale for personal injuries based on Hale's alleged negligence, attributing proximate cause of his injuries to the negligent collision.

Hale filed a plea of privilege to be sued in Grayson County, the county of his residence. Burgess filed a controverting plea insisting that venue was proper in Dallas County. The court overruled Hale's plea of privilege. In his challenge to the trial court's order, Hale argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings that (1) he committed a negligent act or omission in Dallas County, and (2) his negligent act or omission was a proximate cause of Burgess’s injuries. Burgess claimed that Hale (a) failed to keep a proper lookout, (b) failed to apply brakes on time, (c) drove at unreasonable speed, (d) didn't steer away to prevent collision, and (e) was intoxicated. The positioning of the vehicles post-collision posed a hazard to oncoming traffic, necessitating diversion of vehicles to prevent further incidents. The trial court's findings considered Hale's drunkenness, the positions of the vehicles, the efforts of Burgess to direct traffic, and the rescue doctrine.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment that overruled appellant driver's plea of privilege, finding the evidence factually sufficient to show that the collision was proximately caused by one or more negligent acts committed by Hale. The court will refer to principles of the rescue doctrine, which stipulate that the proximate cause of injury to a rescuer who reasonably intervenes to aid persons in imminent peril due to another's negligence is the negligence that elicited the peril, not the rescuer's intervention.

The court will analyze the evidence, including Hale's intoxication, the subsequent positioning of the vehicles, the dangerous condition created, Burgess's response, and the nexus between Hale's negligence and Burgess's resultant harm. It will take into account the standard that the evidence must reveal the likelihood that Hale's negligence – mainly failing to keep a proper lookout, excessive speed, failure to brake, failure to steer clear, and driving while intoxicated – directly led to the accident and created the perilous situation addressed by Burgess.

The court will support its decision with Texas jurisprudence such as the Shultz v. Dallas Power & Light Co. and Longacre v. Reddick cases, recognizing the rescue doctrine as well as supplemental authorities like Restatement of Torts, reinforcing the notion that the negligence causing the rescue situation, not the act of rescuing, is the proximate cause of the rescuer's injuries.

Accordingly, the court will affirm the order overruling Hale's plea of privilege on the grounds that the evidence of negligence on his part as the proximate cause of Burgess's injuries is both legally and factually sufficient, with the rescue doctrine underscoring the legal rationale for attributing proximate cause to Hale's actions.
