Background:
The case involves an insurance company (appellant) appealing a decision made by the District Court of Harris County (Texas). The district court had set aside an award previously made by the State Industrial Accident Board and awarded Mrs. Maggie Singleton (appellee), the mother of the deceased G.A. Singleton, 60 percent of her son’s weekly salary in a lump sum after his death, resulting from an injury sustained while on the job. On April 20, 1927, G.A. Singleton was employed by the Houston Park Corporation when he sustained an injury leading to his death. The Park Corporation was insured by the American Employers' Insurance Company, and as the deceased was unmarried, his mother was his sole heir and beneficiary. Mrs. Singleton filed a claim with the State Industrial Accident Board and subsequently in the district court to receive compensation as a lump sum, also accounting for attorney’s fees.

The insurance company's appeal included several contentions: firstly, that error was made by allowing witness testimony regarding the deceased's pain because the witness was not medically qualified; secondly, that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that the deceased was not already in a diseased condition prior to the injury; thirdly, it was argued that the deceased's weekly salary should not have been submitted to the jury for determination due to his short tenure of employment (only 18 days before injury); and lastly, the insurance company argued that the case should not have considered any alleged illness of the deceased as it was not pleaded in the initial arguments.

The testimony from Mrs. Singleton, a coworker, and a medical doctor supported the claim that G.A. Singleton was in robust health prior to the accident. A coworker, Mrs. Mackey, witnessed the injury's immediate aftermath and Dr. Shilling testified regarding the medical condition that ensued post-accident, supporting the contention that the injury led to the deceased’s deteriorating health and eventual death.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the mother. The court’s rationale was that the testimony of the witness, J.S. Damon, regarding the pain experienced by the deceased, was acceptable as it echoed the statements made by the deceased himself, making it admissible as a quote. On the issue of insufficient evidence, the testimony of Mrs. Singleton, the coworker, and the doctor sufficiently countered the claim of pre-existing disease, illustrating the son’s healthy condition prior to the accident.

Regarding the challenge to the submission of the issue of weekly salary, the court noted that while G.A. Singleton only worked for a short period (18 days), it was within the law to establish a wage by alternate methods. The court supported its decision by referencing past case law that allowed a weekly wage to be established in any manner that may seem just and fair to both parties, particularly when employment history did not allow for a straightforward calculation. 

The court did not allow the issue of the deceased's supposed prior illness to be presented to the jury as the appellant failed to plead it specifically as a defense, thus adhering to the legal principle that defenses must be specifically pleaded to be considered.

In conclusion, the court held that the appellant’s claims of error were not sustainable as the trial court’s judgment was supported by adequate evidence and legal precedent. The mother was entitled to her compensation as ruled by the lower court, free of any reversible errors, resulting in the insurance company's appeal being dismissed.
