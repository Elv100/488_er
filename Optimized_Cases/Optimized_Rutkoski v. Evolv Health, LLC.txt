Background:
Evolv Health is a Dallas-based company that engages in multi-level marketing of health products and operates in Latin America through an indirect subsidiary, EvolvHealth Mexico. Easton Rutkoski, Kyle Palmer, Roberto Gonzalez, and Epic Era Incorporated ("Epic") were involved in a series of events leading to their appeal. Rutkoski, Palmer, and others joined Evolv as employees or distributors in 2012, and negotiations for a joint venture led to the formation of EvolvHealth Mexico, with Rovzar and Roberto Gonzalez in leadership positions.

Tensions arose when Evolv's management suspected negative information dissemination by Steffe and Bott aimed at recruiting away top distributors. Additionally, the suspension of a major distributor, Barrios, led him to leave Evolv with his extensive downline.

Epic was formed, with Rutkoski, Palmer, and others transitioning from Evolv. Numerous distributors terminated their relationships with Evolv to establish business with Epic, and Evolv lost almost all of its Latin America distributors and revenue, precipitating several lawsuits.

Appellants contested a judgment based on a jury verdict finding liability and damages against them for tortious interference (Epic), breach of contract (Gonzalez), and breach of fiduciary duties (Gonzalez, Rutkoski, Palmer; Epic aiding and abetting). Appellants argued that Gonzalez was subject to a release contained in a Termination Agreement and challenged the sufficiency of evidence supporting each claim on which the judgment was based. Evolv contested a summary judgment in favor of Steffe and Bott, claiming they filed more than a scintilla of evidence in response to motions for summary judgment.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment in part, based on sufficient evidence presented for breach of fiduciary duties and a contract wherein Gonzalez was indeed a party. Fiduciary breach was shown through defendantsâ€™ conduct, including failure to return or theft of inventory, resulting in a monetary loss to Evolv. It will suggest a remittitur for the damages award against Epic for tortious interference, given the lack of evidence directly connecting Epic's conduct to the calculated lost profits of Evolv. The suggested remittitur will modify the damages award specifically to reflect the loss associated with the unreturned inventory, not the loss of distributors. The judgment against Gonzalez for breach of contract will be based on evidence showing his involvement in the prevention of contractually obligated assets being returned, which satisfies the breach. Attorney fees awarded for breach of contract will be deemed appropriate since the non-compliance with segregation objections and contention on the incurrence of fees by EvolvHealth Mexico are not preserved for appellate review.

For the cross-appeal, the court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Steffe and Bott, due to insubstantial evidence from Evolv demonstrating that they agreed to be bound by the ESPP, which was foundational to the breach of contract claim.

If Evolv does not accept the remittitur, the tortious interference claim against Epic will be reversed and remanded for a new trial. All other aspects of the trial court's judgment will stand, with each party bearing its own costs.
