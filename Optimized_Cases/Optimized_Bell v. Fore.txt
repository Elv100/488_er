Background:
The background of the case involves a series of events leading to fatal and non-fatal injuries sustained in a double car accident. The incident began when Appellee Addie Campbell Sharp reentered U.S. Highway No. 67 from Bill Purdy's store in Bowie County, Texas, around 6:00 PM on November 14, 1964. While it was lightly raining, she drove her pickup truck in a westerly direction and was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Appellee Thomas J. Marshall, which was towing a horse trailer. The impact caused the horse trailer to overturn and block the highway.

Appellant Estella Payton's husband William Payton Jr., appellant Jewel Fay Bell (acting as next of friend for her minor children with decedent John Homer Bell), and Frank T. Bransford attempted to remove the overturned trailer and horse from the road when another vehicle, driven by W. W. Fore, struck the trailer, killing William Payton Jr. and John Homer Bell and injuring others, including Frank T. Bransford.

Lawsuits were filed by the survivors and injured parties against W. W. Fore and his wife (Myrtle Fore), Thomas J. Marshall, and Addie Campbell Sharp and her husband, Ed Sharp, seeking damages for wrongful death and personal injuries. During the proceedings, appellants nonsuited the Fores but the case continued including them as parties at the behest of the defendants seeking contribution in the event of a recovery against them.

The cases, which shared common legal and factual questions, were consolidated for a jury trial. The jury found Addie Campbell Sharp negligent in causing the first collision but not in causing the second. They absolved Thomas J. Marshall of negligence in the first collision and found W. W. Fore negligent in causing the second collision through various acts of negligence, adding that his manner of driving was a new, independent and intervening cause of the second collision. They also found that the victims assumed the risk of a known danger by attempting to clear the roadway and that the rescue doctrine (where a rescuer can claim damages for injuries sustained during an attempted rescue) did not apply since the negligence of the parties they were rescuing contributed to their injury or death. Consequently, the trial judge rendered a take nothing judgment in favor of Addie Campbell Sharp and Thomas J. Marshall. 

The appeals presented over 70 points against the judgment. The appellants disputed the jury’s findings, contending among other things that the trial court should have submitted issues of negligence and proximate cause regarding Addie Campbell Sharp's involvement in the second collision and that W. W. Fore's negligence should not have been considered a new, independent, and intervening cause but rather a concurring or cooperating cause.

Verdict:
The court upheld the take nothing judgment for Appellees Addie Campbell Sharp and Thomas J. Marshall on claims by Appellants Estella Payton, Jewel Fay Bell, and Frank T. Bransford. The court concluded that although Addie Campbell Sharp's negligence caused the initial accident, it was not the proximate cause of the subsequent accident that resulted in fatalities and injuries. Instead, W. W. Fore's negligent actions were deemed a new and independent intervening cause of the second collision. The court reasoned that a causal connection must be firmly established and not based on conjecture. It was determined that Sharp’s involvement in the first collision was merely a condition that allowed the second collision to occur, not a contributing factor to it.

The court rejected the idea that Addie Campbell Sharp could be held liable for the subsequent collision because she would have had to foresee an extraordinarily unlikely sequence of events stemming from her initial negligence, including the second collision caused by W. W. Fore's driving. Under the law, foreseeability is a requisite component of proximate cause, and it was judged that the sequence of events leading from the first to the second collision was not foreseeable. The court further elucidated that a prior cause cannot be considered proximate if it only furnishes a condition that makes the injury possible but does not directly lead to the injury, especially when the injury results from an unforeseeable intervening cause.

The jury's findings that Marshall was not negligent and that Fore's driving was the sole proximate cause of the second collision were supported by evidence of sufficient probative force, validating the court's decision. As a result, the court ruled that the judgment was correct and denied precedent to propositions that would have held Addie Campbell Sharp responsible as a concurrent cause for an accident that her actions did not directly provoke or could have reasonably been anticipated to cause.
