Background:
The case involves an appeal by appellants, the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railway Company and Walker D. Hines as the Director General of Railroads acting as an agent for the federal government, challenging the judgment given by the District Court of Potter County, Texas. The District Court found in favor of the appellee, an employee of the railway company, in his action for the personal injuries of his wife and the death of his infant son. The appellants argued that the evidence was insufficient, that evidence was improperly admitted, and that the charges on contributory negligence were erroneous.

The employee, working as a pumper for the railway company, lived with his family in box cars furnished by the company located near the train tracks. There were concerns for the safety of the children because of the proximity to the passing trains, necessitating constant vigilance by the parents. The accident occurred on July 9, 1919, when one of the children was seen on the tracks by his mother as a fast train was approaching. The mother, attempting to rescue the child, was injured, and the child was killed by the train.

At trial, the employee claimed the company was negligent in running the train at a high rate of speed near their living quarters, failing to maintain a proper lookout for persons on the track, and not taking proper care to prevent injury after discovering there was a danger. The company presented a defense of contributory negligence, suggesting the parents were negligent in allowing the child on the track and that the mother acted rashly in her rescue attempt. The jury sided with the plaintiff, finding the defendants negligent in the first two allegations and not in the third, while rejecting the defense of contributory negligence.

The plaintiff originally brought the suit against the railway company, but after the termination of federal control of the railways, added Hines as a party. The District Court ruled against both defendants jointly and severally, an outcome which the appellants sought to reverse, asserting liability should rest with the Director General alone, not the company.

Verdict:
Considering the facts presented in the background, the appeal will focus on several key issues. The reversal in regards to the company's liability is based on the principle that the company should not be held liable in its corporate capacity, given that federal control was in effect at the time of the accident. The court will likely rule that the responsibility lies with the government representative, the Director General, who was in control of the railway operations during the federal oversight, therefore dismissing the railway company from the case.

The court's decision on the issue of whether there was a duty to lessen the speed of trains in anticipation of a trespasser will center on the particular circumstances of the location and the fact that there was no crossing, switch tracks, or other operational needs requiring a slowing of the train. The lack of these conditions, combined with the uncontested right of the railway to the exclusive use of its tracks, will lead the court to agree with the appellants that there was no duty necessitating a reduced speed based solely on the proximity of the family's living quarters.

However, the court will likely uphold the duty of the railway to exercise ordinary care in maintaining a lookout for individuals on the track, regardless of their trespassing status. The decision will turn on the evidence showing the feasibility of detecting a child on the tracks from a significant distance, potentially allowing for injury avoidance. Given the evidence, such as the father's ability to see the child from a distance and the tests conducted by various witnesses, the court will find that the jury was justified in determining that the engineer, had he been keeping a proper lookout, would have observed the boy in time to avert the accident.

With respect to contributory negligence, the court will hold that the question of the parents' vigilance was properly submitted to the jury. The parents' failure to prevent the child from entering the tracks does not conclusively establish a lack of ordinary care on their part. Additionally, the court will sustain the legality of the mother's rescue attempt as not being rash, but a split-second decision under emergent conditions.

The court will also address evidentiary issues, such as the admission of tests simulating the visibility of a child on the tracks and statements regarding past conversations between the plaintiff and a representative of the company. While some evidence regarding agreements on safety improvements might have been prejudicial, the objection was not specific enough to form the basis for overturning the verdict.

Based on these considerations, the verdict will affirm the findings of liability against the Director General of Railroads, while reversing the judgment as to the railway company. The Director General, rather than the company, will be held accountable for the negligence identified by the juryâ€”specifically, the failure to maintain a proper lookout. The railway company will be dismissed from the case due to federal control at the time of the accident, placing liability squarely with the government agent.
