Background:
The background of the case involves an 18-year-old deaf mute minor whose fingers were severely injured by a moving train belonging to the defendant railroad company while he was attempting to rescue a barrel that had rolled under it. The minor's mother brought a negligence lawsuit against the railroad company on behalf of her son, claiming that he was in the employ of the company without her consent. It was alleged that the young man was not instructed on the dangers of his work environment by the railroad company and that the company's agents and servants had invited him to work. In response, the railroad company pleaded contributory negligence, suggesting the minor was responsible for his injuries. During the trial, the jury was instructed that the burden was on the railroad company to prove that the minor had enough judgment and discretion to be chargeable with contributory negligence, and that the company was not required to warn the minor of the risk of the act he was attempting. The jury also was allowed to consider future pain and suffering in their assessment of damages. The railroad company appealed the judgment from the District Court of Navarro County (Texas) which had awarded the minor damages.

Verdict:
The court considered the evidence and the applicable law in rendering its decision regarding the claims of negligence and contributory negligence. They found that the trial court’s instructions regarding the burden of proof were erroneous; the defendant railroad company should not have had the burden to prove the minor's capacity for judgment and discretion placed upon them. The court analyzed the minor's age, knowledge, experience, and capacity to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for his own safety, noting that while he should be held accountable, his level of care was not necessarily equivalent to that expected of an adult.

The appeal court similarly found fault with the jury’s instruction regarding the failure to warn the minor. The court indicated that while the defendant had a duty to warn the minor of the dangers of loading and unloading freight if he was not capable of appreciating the risks due to his age, inexperience, infirmity, or lack thereof, the specific act of attempting to rescue the barrel under those given circumstances did not necessarily impose such a duty to warn on the defendant. Thus, it was for the jury to determine whether the minor’s act was within the scope of his duties, and whether a warning about the generic risks would have prevented him from attempting to rescue the barrel.

The court also disagreed with the district court's allowance for recovery for future pain and suffering, ruling that there was no evidence presented to suggest that the minor would suffer future pain and suffering from his injuries.

Therefore, due to the misinstructions to the jury about the defendant's burden and the issue of future pain and suffering, the verdict will reverse the judgment of the district court. The court would remand the case, implying that the district court would need to retry the case with the corrected legal standards and jury instructions, adequately addressing the issues raised on appeal regarding the instructions on the minor's employment status, his comprehension of danger, and the failure of the defendant to warn him of the risks. Additionally, the court would refuse to instruct the jury to allow damages for future pain and suffering unless there was substantial evidence to justify such a claim.
