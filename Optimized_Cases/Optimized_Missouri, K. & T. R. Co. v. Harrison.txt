Background:
The plaintiff, referred to as the traveler, sued the defendant, a railroad company, for personal injuries sustained while trying to rescue a pedestrian, Mrs. Parker, from being struck by the company's train. Mrs. Parker was walking on the company's platform towards the boarding area on a rainy day. A pool of water and company trucks obstructed the path, leading Mrs. Parker to walk close to the train tracks where a portion of the train extended over the platform. As the traveler attempted to pull Mrs. Parker out of the way, she was struck by the train, which then knocked her into the traveler. The traveler was injured after being hit by Mrs. Parker or by the train and propelled against the trucks and platform.

The traveler's allegations included that the railroad company negligently constructed and maintained the platform, leaving inadequate space for passengers to pass due to the position of the trucks and the presence of the pool of water, which resulted in the area being dangerously close to the moving train. Additionally, it was alleged the company's employees failed to take action or warn of the danger despite having the means to do so.

The defendant railroad company, while admitting the presence of the pool and trucks on the platform, contended this was not the proximate cause of the injuries. The defense argued Mrs. Parker's sudden movement towards the train was the proximate cause, and that the accident was too unforeseeable for the company to be held liable. During the trial, the focus was on whether the company was negligent in maintaining the platform conditions and if that negligence contributed to the traveler’s injuries. Contributory negligence by Mrs. Parker or the traveler was not claimed as a defense.

The lower court found in favor of the traveler, and the company's motion for a new trial was overruled, leading to an appeal by the defendant.

Verdict:
The reviewing court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The key reasoning will focus on the jury's role in determining the negligence of the company and whether said negligence was a proximate cause of the traveler's injuries. The possible contributory negligence by Mrs. Parker would not defeat the traveler's recovery as her actions and the company's alleged negligence would be considered concurrent causes of the accident.

The court will likely elaborate that the duty of the railroad company in providing a safe environment extends not only to passengers on the train but also on its premises, such as the platform. It will be emphasized that had the company been negligent, as alleged, it would be responsible for the foreseeable consequences. Even if Mrs. Parker acted negligently, contributing to her own peril, this does not shield the company from liability for its role in the sequence of events that led to the traveler’s injuries.

In summary, the court will predict that the railroad company had a responsibility to maintain a safe platform, foresee potential hazards to passengers based on the conditions present, and take necessary precautions. The failure to do so, as determined by the jury, constituted a proximate cause of the traveler’s injuries, independently of Mrs. Parker's actions, and thus the original verdict in favor of the traveler will be upheld.
