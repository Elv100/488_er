Background:
Harry L. Bowles, a minor, represented by his father, and his parents sued Dr. Lynn L. Bourdon for medical malpractice. On July 16, 1941, Harry suffered a fracture above his left elbow joint due to a fall. Shortly after the incident, Dr. Bourdon X-rayed the elbow, administered anesthesia, set the injury, and wrapped the arm to form a conical shape. Post-procedure, Harry's hand became very blue and cold, with purple fingernails, and he experienced pain. When Harry's mother reported these symptoms to Dr. Bourdon, he allegedly dismissed her concerns and suggested they visit the next day. Dr. Bourdon does not recall being informed of the hand's discoloration but admitted that he would have taken immediate action if such serious symptoms had been reported.

At the follow-up visit, Dr. Bourdon believed the bandage might have been too tight and loosened it slightly. Another doctor, Dr. Bloom, testified that as of July 25, Harry's arm was in "acute state of flexion" and that by August 21, Harry developed a "Volkmann's contracture," a permanent condition characterized by the clawing of the hand and muscle wasting, resulting in limited finger movement. The plaintiffs argued that Dr. Bourdon's negligence included overly tight bandaging causing a stop in blood circulation leading to the contracture, failure to examine the arm or loosen the bandaging promptly after being informed of the symptoms, and not recognizing or treating the contracture between July 16 and August 21.

The trial court instructed a verdict in favor of Dr. Bourdon, stating that the plaintiffs failed to provide expert testimony showing the doctor's negligence and its causation in Harry’s injury. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, which concluded that the evidence did not establish the doctor's negligence as the proximate cause of the contracture, and that when multiple potential causes exist, speculation by the jury is not permissible. The issue was then taken up to the Supreme Court.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court will likely affirm the judgment in favor of Dr. Bourdon. The verdict will be primarily based on the lack of expert medical testimony provided by the plaintiffs that could definitively link the alleged negligence - specifically the tight binding of Harry’s arm - to the development of Volkmann's contracture. The plaintiffs must prove through a doctor of the same school of practice as the defendant that the treatment provided was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the contracture. The evidence should go beyond mere possibility and speculation and must show a direct causal connection.

Expert witnesses in the case have indicated that there are multiple potential causes for Volkmann's contracture, without giving unequivocal testimony that the doctor's actions were the primary cause. The testimony presented suggests that the contracture could have been a result of the initial injury, other medical factors (e.g., thrombosis, arterial spasm), or possibly the tight bandaging. Since the plaintiffs have not provided conclusive evidence to single out the bandaging as the definite cause of the harm suffered, they have not satisfied the legal standard required to establish causation.

Consequently, because the evidence led by the plaintiffs does not meet the threshold for causation, and given that establishment of negligence alone is not sufficient without showing causation, the court will uphold the lower courts' decisions. There is not enough evidence of direct negligence leading to the injury to move beyond the standard of speculation, and thus a verdict for the plaintiffs would not be supported by the evidence presented. The court will note the consistent condemnation of verdicts based on conjecture when more than one potential cause exists, further substantiating the judgment in favor of Dr. Bourdon.
