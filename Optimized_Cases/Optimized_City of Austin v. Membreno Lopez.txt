Background:
This case arises from a tragic and fatal accident on a construction site at the OK Corral Night Club in February 2009. Jaime Membreno, an employee of Luis Romero d/b/a Luis Romero Construction (Romero) and part of the stucco crew, was fatally injured when he came into contact with a power line while standing on a metal scaffold and holding a 10-foot roll of metal mesh near the City of Austin's power line. Membreno was electrocuted while using metal wire-cutters on the mesh.

The City of Austin, also referred to as Austin Energy, owned the power line, which had been installed on the west side of the property in 1975 following an easement obtained in 1972. In November 2008, Saljar, the entity that operated the nightclub, remodeled the building and acted as the general contractor for the project. Saljar hired Romero for applying stucco around the building and submitted a construction permit application with a site plan that inaccurately omitted any indication that construction work would be performed on the west side of the building where the power line was located. The leasing documents failed to disclose a building overhang that extended the building three feet closer to the power lines.

Romero and his crew erected scaffolding that was dangerously close to the City's power lines. Despite the Texas Health and Safety Code and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations requiring de-energization of power lines for work performed within six feet, no one from Saljar or the crew contacted Austin Energy to request the lines be de-energized. 

Evidence presented at trial included photographs and sketches of the accident site, showing the proximity of the scaffold to the power line. Testimony from various witness including Austin Energy employees, and Membreno Lopez, the mother of the deceased's son, provided additional information about the site plan, the erection of the scaffolding, and the events leading up to the electrocution.

Maria Del Rosario Membreno Lopez, as Next Friend of Jaime Antonio Membreno Lopez (Membreno Lopez), sued the City for negligence and negligence per se on behalf of her minor child, claiming that Membreno was her child's father and sole heir. Membreno Lopez alleged that the City had been negligent in its operation, maintenance, and inspection of the utility line, leading to the dangerous condition that caused Membreno's death. Additionally, it was claimed that the City should have denied the construction permit to Saljar due to the omission of essential information regarding the scope of work and proximity to power lines.

The City's cross-claims alleged that Romero and Saljar, in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code, should indemnify the City for liability incurred due to Membreno's contact with the power line. Saljar similarly raised evidentiary sufficiency issues, contesting the apportionment of responsibility under Texas law.

The jury found the City, Romero, Saljar, and Membreno negligent, with varying degrees of responsibility. The jury also determined that Membreno Lopez's child is Membreno's biological son, concluding in a substantial award in damages. The trial court signed a final judgment ordering the City to pay damages and ordering Saljar and Romero to indemnify the City for the same amount. Both the City and Saljar appealed.

Verdict:
In addressing the City's appeal, it will be concluded that Membreno Lopez's allegations and expert’s testimony established that the City had a duty to exercise "good utility practice," involving regular inspection of power lines and poles. Given the City’s failure to remedy the leaning pole, which moved the power line too close to the building, this will be found as a breach of duty. The City’s negligence will be recognized as a proximate cause of Membreno's injuries, as expert testimony indicated that straightening the pole would have placed the line further from the building, avoiding the accident. 

Regarding the determination of Membreno Lopez's child as Membreno's legal heir, the verdict will affirm the findings. It will be established that paternity adjudication at trial was sufficient to confer heirship status upon the child under Estates Code Section 201.001 and Family Code Section 160.201.

Turning to Saljar's cross-appeal, the court will determine that Question No. 8 was not fatally defective and sufficiently reflected the statutory focus on responsibility for the proximity of the work to power lines. It will be established that Saljar controlled the detail crucial to the statute—the decision to have stucco applied on the west-wall overhang within six feet of the power lines. As the entity that decided where the work would occur, Saljar will be affirmed as the "person responsible" under Chapter 752 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

In conclusion, the judgment against the City and Saljar will be affirmed, upholding Membreno Lopez's negligence claim and the City's right to indemnification from Saljar and Romero for the damages awarded.
