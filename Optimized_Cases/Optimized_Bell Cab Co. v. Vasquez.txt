Background:
The case involves an appellant cab company seeking to overturn a trial court decision in favor of an injured son (Ascencion Gomez Vasquez) and his father, based on the rescue doctrine. Ascencion was struck by one of the cab company's drivers while attempting to rescue a girl lying in the middle of the road after a one-car accident. According to the facts, at approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 20, 1966, Ascencion was en route to his job when he witnessed a white car speed by and crash into a utility pole. As he approached the scene, he noticed several people fleeing from the crashed vehicle and saw the girl in the road. Ascencion, in an effort to help, stopped his car and, while attempting to attract the attention of an approaching taxi by waving his arms and shouting, was hit by the cab, fracturing his leg near the knee.

The cab driver, Daniel Vera Auces, was accompanied by a passenger and claimed to be traveling at 25 mph. He stated that he saw Ascencion's parked car but did not notice Ascencion himself until just before the impact. After hitting Ascencion, Auces stopped the cab a short distance away. Subsequently, it was discovered that the girl in the street had also been run over by the taxicab but left the scene with her friend post-accident. 

During the trial, the jury found that Auces had been primarily negligent for failing to maintain a proper lookout, appropriately apply brakes, or control the taxi's speed under the circumstances of his approach to the scene. However, the jury also found that Ascencion did not move out of the way in time, contributing to the accident. The jury then found that Ascencion had exercised ordinary care while attempting to rescue the girl by waving and shouting. The appellees did not request a jury instruction on a lesser standard of care applicable in rescue attempts, and the trial court ruled in their favor, awarding damages for medical expenses and loss of contributions, as well as a significant sum for Ascencion's injury and consequent reduced earning capacity.

The rescue doctrine acknowledges a person's attempt to aid others in imminent danger, accounting for the elevated risks taken under such circumstances. Ascencion's actions were found by the jury to align with those of an ordinarily prudent person under similar circumstances during the rescue attempt.

Verdict:
The appellate court will focus on the reconcilability of the jury's findings to determine the cab company's liability. The court will establish that the findings of the jury are in direct conflict: on one hand, the jury found Ascencion was negligent for not moving aside, which under normal circumstances could justify a take-nothing judgment in favor of the cab company; on the other hand, the jury also found that he behaved as an ordinary prudent person during the rescue attempt, which would normally negate the contributory negligence and support the trial court's judgment in favor of Ascencion.

The critical verdict component will be the standard of care required during the rescue attempt. Although the heroes' actions typically transcend those of an ordinary prudent person, the legal standard must accommodate the inherent risks in a rescue, which may require actions not aligning with typical standards of self-care. The appellate court will dissect whether the lower standard of care, such as "rash" or "reckless" behavior, was properly applied to Ascencion's actions during the rescue attempt, according to the instructions given to the jury.

The court will scrutinize how the jury was directed to reconcile the higher risks assumed during a rescue with the standard of care expected from an ordinary prudent person, absent the rescue context. Since the jury was instructed to apply the same standard of care, the findings may be viewed as incompatible, leading the appellate court to reverse the trial court judgment for a fundamental inconsistency. The court will likely parse the intricacies of the rescue doctrine and its implications on a rescuer's standard of care, ultimately concluding that Ascencion should not face a higher bar for contributory negligence during a rescue attempt. 

However, considering that there was no formal pleading or specific finding to support the lowered care standard during a rescue, and the rescue doctrine itself anticipates negligence by the defendant that created the peril, but without a specific finding on that issue, there may be a technical inadequacy in applying the rescue doctrine to justify the trial court's judgment.

In conclusion, the appellate court's reasoning will likely be grounded in the irreconcilable jury findings about Ascencion's care during the rescue attempt versus his contributory negligence, necessitating a reversal of the trial court's ruling and a remand for further proceedings consistent with the proper standards and interpretations of the rescue doctrine.
