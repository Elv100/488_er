Background:
The appellant in this case is an electric company, while the appellee is a landowner. On May 24, 1931, a high tension wire belonging to the electric company broke and fell on the landowner's property, igniting a fire. The landowner, a widow who managed her farm, attempted to extinguish the fire and, in doing so, received several electric shocks, causing personal injury. She was unfamiliar with electricity and its hazards. Her fences, which were composed of wire, became electrified due to being connected with the fallen power line.

The landowner filed a personal injury lawsuit against the electric company, alleging negligence. The jury found in her favor, concluding that the electric company had not taken proper precautions, such as grounding the wires of the fence under its power line and failing to maintain a circuit breaker that would cut off the current when the transmission line broke. The case hinged on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which allows a negligence claim to be made based on the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents. The appellant electric company argued that the trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor and challenged the jury instructions regarding grounding the fences and the adjustment of the circuit breaker.

The jury found that the electric company's failure to have a properly adjusted circuit breaker and the lack of sufficient grounding constituted negligence and were proximate causes of the injuries. Furthermore, the jury determined that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, despite the company's argument that she should have known the danger after receiving shocks.

Verdict:
The court is expected to affirm the judgment of the trial court. The reason for this is that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, given that electricity is a force that requires a high standard of care and the types of accidents that occurred in this case generally do not happen absent negligence on part of the entity controlling it. Moreover, the evidence provided demonstrated that the electric company did not act with due care.

The burden of proof shifted to the electric company to demonstrate due care, but they failed to do so, evidenced by their lack of a properly functioning circuit breaker. Additionally, the mere fact that the electric current was discharged from a fallen wire and the landowner suffered injuries makes a prima facie case of negligence. The court will observe that the electric company did not ground the fence sufficiently and set the circuit breaker too high at 80 amperes despite knowing that a lower setting might have prevented the injury. 

Furthermore, the jury's assessment will likely be considered reasonable and not subject to disturbance by the higher court. These findings indicate the companyâ€™s negligence in protecting the public. The electric company's defenses about the landowner's contributory negligence are not sustainable because she lacked knowledge of the danger, and her actions were in response to an emergency. Additionally, the potential juror misconduct discussed by the appellant will likely be considered irrelevant as it transpired after the verdict was already established. Hence, the appeals court is expected to uphold the original judgment in favor of the appellee (the landowner).
