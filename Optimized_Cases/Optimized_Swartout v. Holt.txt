Background:
In February 1952, the patient Elvira Louise Swartout was taken to a hospital and clinic operated by appellees Dr. R. D. Holt and Dr. J. T. Archer, Jr., in Meridian, Texas, due to abdominal pain and nausea. Dr. Holt recommended surgical intervention, which was scheduled for February 28, 1952. The parents informed Dr. Holt about their daughter's prior negative reaction to ether anesthesia during a tonsillectomy that required resuscitation. Despite the parents’ objections to the use of ether and the promise of spinal anesthesia, ether was administered, resulting in the patient’s death on March 2, 1952.

The parents of Elvira, appellants in this case, subsequently filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the appellee doctors. During the first trial, the jury could not reach a verdict, leading to a mistrial. In a second trial, the jury found in favor of the doctors. The parents claimed they informed Dr. Holt of the patient's previous reaction to anesthesia, which the doctors denied. The jury verdict found that the parents did not sufficiently inform Dr. Holt about the anesthesia allergy before the administration of ether and that no negligence resulted from this failure. As such, the child’s death was deemed an unavoidable accident, and no pecuniary loss was suffered by the parents as a result. The appellants challenged the trial's outcome through a motion for a new trial on the basis that the jury was not impartial, particularly focusing on juror C. E. Dansby who potentially had a conflict of interest.

Verdict:
The court rejected the appellants' claim of an impartial jury, citing there was no restriction on the voir dire (preliminary examination of a witness or a juror by a judge or counsel) process by the trial court. Also, there was no substantial evidence presented that would lead one to conclusively determine that Mr. Dansby conducted himself with partiality or bias. Given the jurors' verdict, the burden of proof for medical malpractice and the cause of the child's death falling on the appellants was not met, as defined by the precedent that a diagnosis or treatment must be proven negligent and causally connected to the injuries by a physician from the same school of practice. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence showcasing misconduct by the juror in question or any indication that the jury as a whole did not perform their duties impartially.

In consideration of these factors, the appellate court will predict that the denial of the motion for a new trial by the trial court did not constitute an abuse of discretion. There wasn't a substantial likelihood that any alleged misconduct by juror C. E. Dansby critically impacted the trial outcome. As such, the appellants have not convincingly demonstrated that they were deprived of a right to an unbiased and fair trial due to juror misconduct. Therefore, the verdict of the trial court will be affirmed, and the parents will not receive relief from the suit against the doctors.
