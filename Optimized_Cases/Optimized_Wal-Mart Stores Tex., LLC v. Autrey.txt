Background: Jennifer R. Autrey slipped and fell in a Walmart store in Palestine, Texas, resulting in a premises liability claim against Walmart due to alleged negligence which she claimed caused her fall and subsequent injuries. On September 3, 2016, a cashier at Walmart named Breanna Love was notified by a customer of an existing spill near the front doors and vision center. Love, trained to handle spills, attempted to address the situation by assessing and attempting to clean the spill, which stretched from the customer service area to the front doors. The spill was deemed too large for Love to manage alone, so she contacted maintenance and guarded the nearest part of the spill, warning customers. However, no warning signs were placed, as retrieving them would require Love to leave the spill unattended.

Autrey and her husband entered the store at that time, and despite Love's efforts, Autrey slipped and fell. There is disputed testimony regarding whether Love warned Autrey about the spill. Autrey immediately felt pain from the fall, and after the incident, her neck pain worsened, which led her to seek medical attention. The spill was confirmed to be unwarned and not cleaned prior to Autrey's fall. Autrey was diagnosed with aggravated pre-existing asymptomatic disc disease and required surgery, a spinal fusion, and a discectomy, followed by the implantation of a spinal cord stimulator.

Medical professionals that treated Autrey testified that the fall at Walmart exacerbated her preexisting condition, causing significant pain necessitating surgery. Walmart, however, appealed, arguing that the spill was an open and obvious condition, that the store took reasonable steps to address the spill, and that Autrey's injuries could be attributed to her pre-existing condition. Moreover, Walmart claimed a trial court error for refusing to give a jury instruction on sole proximate cause related to a man spilling a drink which could account for the spill leading to Autrey’s fall.

Verdict: The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In doing so, the appellate court found that there was legally and factually sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings. The court established that the spill was not open and obvious, and that Walmart had failed in both adequately warning Autrey and making the condition safe. Despite Walmart's arguments, the jury was entitled to determine that the spill posed an unreasonable risk of harm, and they were entitled to weigh conflicting evidence regarding if adequate warnings were given. 

The evidence showed that Walmart had actual knowledge of the spill and had failed to take ordinary care to make the premises safe since the spill wasn't cleaned up, nor proper warning given prior to Autrey's fall. As for the medical expenses, expert testimony indicated that Autrey's fall at Walmart did aggravate her pre-existing condition, justifying the medical treatments and associated costs. Thus, the judgment awarded her damages for past and future pain, mental anguish, and medical expenses. Regarding the rejected sole proximate cause instruction, the appellate court found that the actions of the man with the drink (possible alternative cause of the spill) did not negate Walmart’s failure to make the condition safe or provide adequate warning, hence affirming the lack of such an instruction in the jury charge. The court's reasoning emphasized that a defendant could be found negligent even when a third party may also share in causation, provided the defendant's own lack of reasonable care contributed substantially to the harm.
