Background:
The appellant, the family of the deceased patient Brett Gentry, initiated a wrongful death and survival action against Wise Regional Health Systems (formerly known as Decatur Community Hospital) and several nurses, claiming negligence and gross negligence in the diagnosis and treatment of Gentry, which they alleged resulted in her death. Gentry, a 16-year-old girl, initially saw her primary care doctor on December 17, 2002, for symptoms like high temperature, cough, congestion, and chest pain. Two days later, she visited the Decatur Community Hospital emergency room due to exacerbated symptoms, including coughing, cramping, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness. During her time in the hospital, Gentry also experienced difficulty breathing, chest pain, episodes of low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Two days after admission, while being moved to the ICU, she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be resuscitated.

The appellants (the hospital and the nurses) filed a plea to the jurisdiction claiming sovereign immunity, arguing that the family's allegations did not constitute a waiver of such immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act because they did not involve the condition or use of tangible personal property causing Gentry's death. Three expert witnesses were retained by the family, and depositions were provided. The family's pleadings included allegations that the defendant nurses misused tangible personal property, such as IVs, medications (including Stadol), a pulse oximeter, a blood pressure machine/cuff, an oxygen supply, an oxygen mask, and an ambu bag.

Verdict:
The appellate court was set to uphold the trial court's decision regarding the claims that involved the use of certain medications, acknowledging that the administration of medications by the hospital and nurses could be considered a "use" of tangible personal property. The court would consider the facts that were provided, such as the medical testimony suggesting that the medications administered contributed to Gentry's hypoxia and, when combined with her myocarditis, led to a heart arrhythmia which caused her death. Therefore, the appeals court would find that the family's pleadings were sufficient to establish a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the medications. In supporting the trial court's decision, the court would emphasize the family's expert witnesses' testimonies that stated the aforementioned sequence of medical events as well as the duty the nurses had to question the doctor's prescriptions based on Gentryâ€™s condition.

As for the family's claims based on the failures to act and allegations pertaining to the use of other medical equipment like the pulse oximeter, blood pressure machine, and other items, the verdict would have been different. The appellate court would determine that these allegations or any evidence that came forth during the plea to the jurisdiction did not sufficiently establish that these items caused or contributed to Gentry's death. In such claims, the court would reverse the trial court's order and dismiss those for want of subject matter jurisdiction given the absence of a proximate cause relationship between their use and Gentry's death. 

The appellate court would affirm the trial court's order in part, agreeing where there's sufficient evidence to establish a link between the use of certain medications and Gentry's death but reverse and dismiss the other claims where such a link is absent.
