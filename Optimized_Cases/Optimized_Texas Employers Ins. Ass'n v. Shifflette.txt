Background:
The case involves appellant Texas Employers Insurance Association, the workmen's compensation insurer of the employer, Fant Milling Company, and appellee Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, the surviving widow of the deceased employee, A. H. Shifflette. Mr. Shifflette suffered from a heart condition known as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle which is generally incurable but manageable with care against violent exercise, proper diet, and medical treatment. On the day before his death, he was compelled to climb the stairs to the fourth floor of his workplace because the passenger elevator was out of order and he was expressly forbidden to use the freight elevator. Later that day, Mr. Shifflette appeared ill to his wife and claimed he had fallen on the stairs. He passed away during the night. Mrs. Shifflette contended that the exertion of climbing the stairs placed undue strain on her husband's weakened heart, causing a rupture leading to his death. The insurer countered that Mr. Shifflette's demise was a natural result of his existing disease and not work-related.

The trial court ruled in favor of the widow, affirming the jury’s conclusion that Mr. Shifflette had suffered a work-related injury that contributed to his death. The evidence supported that the exertion of climbing the stairs was compelled by his employment and resulted in heart damage leading to his death. The employee's comments to his wife regarding his condition were deemed admissible as spontaneous utterances. The insurer appealed the judgment, raising two main points for consideration: (1) evidence insufficiency to prove that Mr. Shifflette died as a result of an injury received during the scope of his employment; and (2) the alleged hearsay nature of the deceased's statements to his wife should have precluded their admission in court.

Verdict:
The court is expected to acknowledge that the jury's finding that Mr. Shifflette suffered a work-related accidental injury contributing to his death is supported by substantial evidence. The evidence will likely be seen as demonstrating that, due to the malfunctions of the passenger elevator, Mr. Shifflette was obligated to climb multiple flights of stairs, subsequently straining his diseased heart muscle. Medical expert testimony will support the chain of events leading from myocarditis through exertion, rupture, hemorrhage, additional strain, and subsequent ruptures to eventual death.

It is likely that the court will consider Mr. Shifflette's declaration to his wife as part of the res gestae, meaning that the spontaneous statement arose so closely in time and causation to the strenuous activity that it is not overly prejudiced by reflection or fabrication. The comments will likely be considered spontaneous utterances induced by the event (exertion and fall), solicited in an inquisitive interaction from Mrs. Shifflette to explain his visibly poor condition. The court will probably evaluate that the circumstances, including the physical strain, pain, and nearness to the event, validate the trial court's admission of the statement as part of the res gestae exception to hearsay.

The court is expected to affirm the findings of the trial court and jury that the injury sustained by Mr. Shifflette in the course of his employment materially contributed to his death. They may also uphold that the deceased’s death was not solely due to his existing heart disease. As a result, the court will likely affirm the award of the statutory lump sum to the widow, Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, having determined that the legal basis for the judgment aligns with the evidence presented and the applicable law. The insurer's request for a peremptory instruction will be interpreted as appropriately denied, and the court will not find an abuse of discretion in the trial court's admission of Mr. Shifflette's statement to his wife as evidence.

In conclusion, the court will likely affirm the decision in favor of the appellee Mrs. Byrde Shifflette, resulting in the continued provision of compensation due to the work-related injury that contributed to Mr. Shifflette's death.
