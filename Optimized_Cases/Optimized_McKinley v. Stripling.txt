Background:
Geneva and Albert McKinley, husband and wife, filed a lawsuit against Dr. Dennis Stripling for malpractice related to surgeries performed on Geneva's hand without obtaining her informed consent. Geneva McKinley broke her right wrist in 1980 and was treated by an orthopedic surgeon, who set the fracture. However, a malunion occurred, and she also experienced numbness and tingling in her hand. After being referred to a neurosurgeon, she was then referred to Dr. Stripling regarding the malunion. Dr. Stripling performed an osteotomy on her wrist and, in a subsequent surgery, attempted to correct her thumb's restricted movement by performing a tendon transfer from her right index finger to her thumb, a procedure that was not discussed with Mrs. McKinley, nor were the risks involved disclosed to her. Despite the successful wrist repair, she could not move her index finger post-surgery, and a later surgery to correct this issue resulted in restricted movement of her middle finger. Another doctor eventually performed corrective surgery which restored some function.

The McKinleys sued Dr. Stripling for failing to disclose the risks associated with the tendon transfer surgery. During the trial, Dr. Stripling objected to the McKinleys' failure to include a jury issue concerning proximate cause, which Geneva McKinley argued was unnecessary and refused to submit. The jury found that the inherent risks of tendon transfer surgery could influence a reasonable person in consenting to the operation, and that McKinley had suffered restricted movement as a result of the surgeries. However, a finding of proximate cause (whether failure to obtain informed consent was the cause of McKinley's injuries) was not submitted as an issue to the jury.

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the McKinleys for $19,915.08 based on that verdict. The Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision, holding that proximate cause was a required element to establish negligence on the doctor's part and that failing to request a proximate cause issue to the jury amounted to a waiver of the right to recover on the claim. The court of appeals also mentioned that the correct standard for proximate cause should be objective, considering a reasonable person, and not subjective to the specific plaintiff. The case was brought to the Texas Supreme Court for review.

Verdict:
It is likely that the court will affirm the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeals, upholding that Dr. Stripling is not liable to the McKinleys for negligence in treating Geneva without informed consent due to the lack of a jury finding on proximate cause. The Supreme Court will likely argue that while negligence was established, recovery under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act of Texas requires a demonstration of proximate cause, in line with traditional negligence actions. The court will probably clarify that an informed consent cause of action, while based on a statutory duty to disclose risks of surgery, still demands a finding that the breach of this duty proximately caused the injuries for liability to arise.

The court should reason that proximate cause remains a necessary element, countering any notion of strict liability, and any omission of the term "proximate cause" in the statute does not abrogate the requirement for its evidentiary submission to a jury. The court will likely reiterate the objective standard for informed consent actions, asserting that it is a question of whether a fully informed reasonable person would have consented to the treatment, not the actual decision of the particular plaintiff. As the McKinleys conceded that causation is a component of their claim but failed to submit a proximate cause issue despite objection, the appellate court's decision will likely be affirmed, citing the plaintiffs' waiver under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279. There can be no recovery without a jury's finding on the causation element, and thus Dr. Stripling would not be found liable due to this procedural oversight by the McKinleys.
