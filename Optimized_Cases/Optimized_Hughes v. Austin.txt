Background:
The appellant, a property owner, sought review after the District Court of Travis County (Texas) ruled in favor of the City, sustaining demurrers (objections) and granting judgment for the City in a case where the property owner sought to recover damages. These damages were claimed for injuries and deaths of his livestock, which were said to be caused by mud banks and stagnant water. The water levels in the river adjacent to the owner's property had been lowered during the construction of a dam by the city, resulting in the formation of these dangerous conditions. The owner claimed that several of his horses died after getting mired in the mud, and others were injured or died from the effects after being rescued.

The appellant sought recovery for the value of the horses that died, the deterioration in value of the horses that were injured, and the expenses incurred in efforts to protect the animals from the hazard, treat their injuries, and feed them. The petition including these claims had paragraphs (12th and 13th) and a trial amendment detailing the damages, which were questioned on the grounds of certainty, remoteness, and ownership of the feed provided to the livestock. Demurrers to these concerns were sustained by the lower court, prompting the property owner to appeal the decision.

Verdict:
On appeal, it is anticipated that the court will reverse the decision of the lower court, finding that the city is liable for the damages sustained by the property owner's livestock due to the formation of mud banks as a natural and probable consequence of the city's actions. The reasonable expenses incurred in guarding the stock, moving them to safety, and returning them, as well as efforts to treat injured horses, will be acknowledged as recoverable damages. The court will likely reason that since the city's construction of the dam caused the hazardous mud banks, the property owner should not be precluded from using his property and protecting his livestock from danger. 

Furthermore, the court will opine that the owner has the right to engage in reasonable actions to safeguard his property from the dangers created by the wrongful acts of the city, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard should be covered. It is also projected that the court will hold the city liable for the difference between the expense and cost of keeping the livestock before the tort and the value of the hay and sorghum feed, if such expense was necessary and reasonable. Additionally, the court is expected to remand the case for a new trial to properly consider which specific damages are recoverable based on detailed and precise pleadings that avoid confusion around the number and condition of the horses affected, as well as to reconcile any inconsistencies in the amounts claimed. The court will encourage precision in establishing the recoverable damages, and only those that are proximate and not remote will be awarded. However, the court will not limit the property owner from pursuing the full measure of damages that naturally follow from the wrongful act, and will clarify that damages need not be foreseeable to be recoverable, as long as they are the natural and direct consequence of the wrongful act.
