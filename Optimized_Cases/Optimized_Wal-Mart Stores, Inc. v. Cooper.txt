Background:
Donna Rauner purchased a mattress and box spring from the Lewisville Sam's Club, where an employee tied both items to the roof of her Jeep Cherokee. Though the employee testified to advising Rauner not to exceed 35 miles per hour and to avoid major roads, Rauner claimed she received no such warning. Upon entering the Interstate 35 and reaching a speed of roughly 40 miles per hour, the mattress and box spring came loose, falling onto the highway—one on or near the right shoulder, the other between the center and left lanes.

Rauner stopped and called for help. Meanwhile, several vehicles managed to avoid the obstacles. Bevin Spence Cooper, alongside a co-worker, noticed the items and Rauner while traveling on the same interstate. Cooper parked in a nearby lot and ran across the service road and medians to the scene. As he attempted to drag the box spring across the lanes, he was struck by Tory Taylor's car, resulting in severe injuries to Cooper.

Cooper filed a negligence lawsuit against Taylor, Rauner, and Wal-Mart (operating the Sam's Club). The trial court denied Wal-Mart's motion for an instructed verdict, leading the jury to find Taylor, Rauner, Wal-Mart, and Cooper equally responsible for the accident, attributing 33 percent of the responsibility to each, except Taylor, who was deemed 1 percent responsible. Subsequently, Wal-Mart's motion for judgement notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) was also denied, and judgment was rendered based on the verdict.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment against Wal-Mart. The reversal will be due to a lack of sufficient evidence to establish proximate cause with respect to Wal-Mart's actions. Despite potentially accepting that Wal-Mart had a duty of care and may have been negligently responsible for the mattress and box spring coming loose from Rauner's vehicle, the link between Wal-Mart's actions and Cooper's injuries will not be seen as direct enough to satisfy the elements of proximate cause, which includes both cause in fact and foreseeability.

In this case, the causal chain connecting the original negligent act (improperly securing the mattress) with the resulting injury (Cooper being struck by a vehicle) will be viewed as too attenuated. The intervening actions of Cooper—running from a distant parking lot to the accident site and attempting to retrieve the box spring without caution—will be seen as separate from the influence of Wal-Mart's original negligence. Cooper's decision to enter the highway to attempt a rescue will be considered unforeseeable by Wal-Mart, breaking the causal nexus required for proximate cause.

Even if the rescue doctrine applies, which generally holds that a rescuer injured while aiding a victim in danger due to someone else's negligence can claim against the negligent party, it will still require the establishment of proximate cause. Therefore, Wal-Mart's negligence will not be considered a proximate cause of Cooper's injuries. The trial court's error in not instructing a verdict or rendering judgement n.o.v. in favor of Wal-Mart will be recognized, leading to the appellate court's directive that Cooper take nothing from Wal-Mart. The judgement will be rendered in Wal-Mart's favor because proximate cause is a fundamental element of negligence that Cooper will be seen as having failed to sufficiently prove against Wal-Mart.
