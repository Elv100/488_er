Background:
William Nami, a railroad employee of Union Pacific Railroad (Union Pacific) for 32 years, contracted the West Nile virus from a mosquito bite and sued his employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act ("FELA"), alleging that Union Pacific failed to provide a safe workplace. Nami operated a tamping machine in Brazoria County near Sweeny, known for its dense mosquito population, which increased following Hurricane Ike. The area surrounding the tracks where Nami worked was overgrown with weeds, high grass, and sometimes pools of water. Nami was frequently bitten by mosquitoes on the job, even inside the tamper, which had holes and a non-functioning air conditioner. Union Pacific knew about the risk that mosquitoes could carry the West Nile virus and had issued bulletins warning employees about the virus and recommending the use of mosquito repellent, though they did not provide repellent to employees.

Nami became ill with flu-like symptoms, which escalated and were later diagnosed as West Nile virus and encephalitis. His illness resulted in long-term health problems, preventing him from returning to work. Nami did not have prior knowledge of the bulletin or warnings from Union Pacific, was unaware of the risks of the West Nile virus, and did not take measures to prevent mosquito bites. At trial, a jury found both Union Pacific and Nami negligent, attributing 80% of the responsibility to Union Pacific and 20% to Nami, and awarded Nami $752,000 in damages.

Union Pacific appealed, invoking the common-law doctrine of ferae naturae, arguing that they owed no legal duty to protect against wild animals (mosquitoes in this case) indigenous to the property unless the landowner had attracted or controlled the animals, which they had not.

Verdict:
The verdict for the case will likely be that the doctrine of ferae naturae applies, which precludes railroad liability because Union Pacific did not attract or control the mosquitoes. The duty to provide a safe workplace does not extend to uncontrollable, indigenous wild animals unless the property owner has taken action to concentrate such animals on the property, has reduced them to possession, or knows of an unreasonable risk that can be mitigated or warned against. Since mosquitoes are indigenous to Texas, and there is no evidence that Union Pacific could have possibly attracted or controlled the mosquito population around its tracks or reduced the mosquitoes to possession, they had no duty to protect Nami from them.

In assessing foreseeability, while Union Pacific did issue a bulletin warning employees about the West Nile virus, which indicates some level of foreseeability, the risk of contracting it was relatively low, and less than 1% of cases develop serious illnesses. The mere presence of local mosquitoes, even in large numbers, does not itself indicate an unreasonable risk created by the employer, nor does it demonstrate that the employer's actions or inactions significantly exacerbated an existing natural risk. Moreover, Union Pacific's failure to mow the right-of-way or repair the tamper cab could not be definitively linked to creating an environment that attracted infected mosquitoes.

In light of these factors, the judgment of the lower court will likely be reversed, and a judgment rendered for Union Pacific, on the grounds that there was no breach of duty under FELA by Union Pacific when Nami contracted the West Nile virus. The application of the ferae naturae doctrine will be upheld, indicating that Union Pacific is not liable for Namiâ€™s injuries contracted from indigenous wild animals that they did not attract or control on the property.
