Background:
Sinue Miranda, a clerk at the Handi Plus #17 convenience store, suffered injuries, which resulted in paralysis from the waist down, during an armed robbery on April 27, 2007. The Handi Plus #17 store is owned by Global New Millennium Partners (Global) and was leased to TriStar Convenience Stores, Inc. (TriStar), a subsidiary of Gulshan Enterprises, Inc. (Gulshan). Gulshan had a contract with Motiva Enterprises, LLC (Motiva) under which Gulshan could use the "Shell" brand name under the condition of compliance with the agreement's terms including the operation of outlets in a secure manner to prevent criminal activity.

TriStar subleased the convenience store to Bhanu, LLC with the business agreement involving the sale of motor fuel and an understanding that TriStar could enter the premises for inspections and other purposes. Bhanu was required to conduct business lawfully and ethically. It was expressly forbidden to install revenue-generating machines without TriStar's consent. The store had illegal gambling machines ("eight-liners") owned by a third party, HNC Amusements, Inc., which were paid out in cash.

Miranda alleged that the presence of these gambling machines increased the risk of violent crime, like the robbery he experienced, and that there were previous instances of this. Managers from Bhanu and TriStar, including TriStar president Shoukat Dhanani, asserted that they either did not know about the machines or would have taken action had they known. A security expert opined that TriStar had a duty to ensure that illegal gambling did not occur and that their negligence in this matter increased the likelihood of the armed robbery.

Miranda sued TriStar and other entities for negligence, premises liability, negligent activity, and negligence per se. TriStar requested summary judgment, claiming Miranda could not establish the proximate cause between TriStar's alleged negligence and the robbery.

Verdict:
The trial court granted summary judgment in TriStar's favor, concluding that Miranda did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between TriStar's actions and the robbery. TriStar successfully argued that the assailant's conduct was uncontrollable by them and their connection to the property did not include management of substantive operations or security. TriStar further maintained that chapter 47 of the Penal Code, which addresses gambling, does not establish a basis for tort liability. 

Miranda, on the other hand, was unable to prove the foreseeability or causation of his injuries resulting from TriStar's failure to terminate the sublease based on the alleged illegal gambling. The prior instances of crime at or near the store did not rise to the same level of violence as the shooting and therefore did not indicate a likelihood of such an event occurring. The expert's opinion that the gambling machines increased the likelihood of violent crime was not backed by data comparing criminal activity in similar establishments versus the general population.

The appellate court must determine that the trial court did not err when there is no tangible evidence of proximate cause—cause-in-fact and foreseeability—between TriStar's actions and Miranda's injuries. Given that violent crimes at or near the store were not previously reported and that no other evidence suggested a likelihood of such an occurrence, the claim against TriStar for proximate cause is weak. With this deficiency in the evidence, it will be legally concluded that TriStar was not responsible for the robbery or Miranda's subsequent injuries. Miranda's inability to demonstrate that TriStar's alleged negligence was directly responsible for his predicament is central to the affirmation of the summary judgment. Therefore, the court will uphold the trial court's ruling and affirm the judgement in favor of TriStar.
