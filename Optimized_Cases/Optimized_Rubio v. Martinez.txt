Background:
The case in question involves the Rubio family (appellants, hereinafter referred to as "the Rubios") appealing against the 135th District Court of Victoria County, Texas, which granted summary judgment in favor of Guadalupe Martinez (appellee, hereinafter "Martinez"). The legal action by the Rubios stemmed from the wrongful death and survival actions that were related to negligent entrustment and negligence against both the driver Juan Lopez (hereinafter "Lopez"), and Martinez, the vehicle owner, involving an accident and subsequent death of Jose Rubio, who was rear-ended by a car driven by Lopez but owned by Martinez. Martinez was not present in the car at the time of the accident. Post-accident, Lopez fled the scene and his whereabouts remain unknown to Martinez. Jose Rubio was not found to be physically injured at the time of the accident following an investigation by the Victoria Police Department. Yet, approximately 26 days later, Jose Rubio committed suicide. 

The Rubios alleged negligent entrustment, claiming Martinez allowed an admittedly untrained, unlicensed, and incompetent driver to operate her vehicle. Martinez's primary defense was that Jose's committing suicide was the sole cause of his death, negating the liability of the owner of the vehicle involved in the preceding accident. Martinez filed for both traditional and no-evidence motions for summary judgment, with the court granting summary judgment as to the Rubios' wrongful death and survival claims, severing the claimed wrongful death and survival causes of action from the claims of negligent entrustment and negligence.

The Rubios contended that the court erred in granting the no-evidence motion for summary judgment for Martinez, claiming she provided implied consent to Lopez because of their dating relationship. They also argued that the suicide defense should not apply, as Martinez failed to establish it as a matter of law, and contested the striking of Paula Escobar's affidavit along with the enforcement of a supposed Rule 11 agreement regarding the scheduling of a summary judgment hearing post Martinez’s deposition, although the relevant documents were not presented in the appeal record.

Verdict:
The judgment will likely be affirmed due to failure on the part of the Rubios to present adequate evidence to counter the no-evidence summary judgment and to demonstrate that Martinez either expressly or impliedly entrusted her vehicle to Lopez. The court will find that the Rubios provided no evidence to suggest that Martinez foresaw or had any knowledge of Lopez being unlicensed, incompetent, or reckless that would raise a legitimate issue on Martinez's part regarding negligent entrustment. 

Furthermore, considering the affirmative defense of suicide, the court will determine that Martinez successfully established that the suicide of Jose Rubio was the sole cause of damage and death, unconnected to the earlier accident or any action of Martinez. As the Rubios' cause of action for wrongful death accrued upon the death of Jose Rubio, and the evidence including the death certificate and the accident report confirmed suicide independently of the accident, the burden shifted to the Rubios to raise an issue of fact showing that the suicide was caused by Martinez’s failure to comply with a legal standard – a burden they did not meet.

The court will dismiss Paula Escobar's affidavit as it did not relate to Martinez's negligence or liability and thus would not affect the summary judgment determination. Regarding the claimed Rule 11 agreement, the absence of documentation in the appellate record would lead the court to presume the correctness of the trial court's actions, dismissing that issue as well.

In conclusion, the appellate court will hold that Martinez is not culpable based on the evidence provided for the negligent entrustment, demonstrating that Martinez is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the Rubios' arguments on all issues presented in their appeal will be overruled, sustaining the trial court’s initial ruling.
