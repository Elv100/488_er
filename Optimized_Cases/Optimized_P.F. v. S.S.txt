Background:
This case pertains to P.F. and J.F., as next friends of their daughter, I.F., collectively referred to as Irsia, suing the defendants referred to as Dad, Junior, and Debbie for negligence and negligence per se in connection with sexual assaults committed by A.V. (Alvin), I.G. (Ivan), and J.A. (Joe) during a party at which Irsia was the victim. The party, hosted by Junior and supervised by Debbie, involved the consumption of alcohol and marijuana by ninth graders, and the attendance grew to about twenty to thirty males and four females, including Irsia. Dad, the father of Junior and Debbie, was away at the time, attending a college event. He had forbidden his children from having guests over during his absence, but his directive was disregarded. Junior organized the get-together with the anticipation of alcohol consumption, and among those invited were Alvin, Irsia, and other boys including Ivan and Joe. Debbie, upon discovering the party was happening, opted to supervise rather than stop it.

Debbie took some intoxicated children home during the party, and while she was away, Irsia became extremely intoxicated and was sexually assaulted by Alvin and possibly Ivan in the front or side yard of the home, followed by a sexual act with Joe. May, another supervisor, was aware of what was happening and informed Debbie but only locked the front door from the inside. Before these events, Alvin had been involved in a sexual act with Annette in the bathroom, which many at the party, including Junior and Irsia, knew about and which was publicly laughed at by attendees. Despite this knowledge, Debbie walked away from the situation in the bathroom after deeming it "disgusting."

The primary legal questions involve whether Dad, Debbie, and Junior, as hosts of the party, had a duty to act with care towards the event's attendees, and if so, whether their actions or inactions were the proximate cause of the assaults, as well as addressing the issue of superseding cause due to the criminal acts of Alvin, Ivan, and Joe.

Verdict:
The trial court affirmed part and reversed part of the judgment concerning the claims against Dad, Debbie, and Junior. As for Dad, the trial court's summary judgment was upheld because there was no evidence that Dad knew or approved of the party before leaving for the weekend or before the assault occurred. Hence, from Dad's standpoint, the criminal conduct of Alvin, Ivan, and Joe was a superseding cause of Irsia's injuries, and there was no material fact to suggest he could anticipate such an outcome.

However, the trial court's summary judgment denying recovery was reversed for the claims against Debbie and Junior as issues of fact existed regarding their potential negligence. The evidence suggested that during the party, Debbie and Junior exerted some level of control and oversight, which escalated to the point where Debbie considered herself mature enough to supervise the event and even reached out to May for help. Given her intent and efforts to monitor and even control certain behaviors like substance use and sexual conduct, a fact-finder could reasonably argue that Debbie assumed a duty to act with reasonable care, which may have been breached when she opted not to intervene more directly in clear instances of sexual activity (e.g., when Annette and Alvin were in the bathroom) and when the party escalated into a dangerous environment. Similarly, Junior had recognized the party's lack of control but failed to intervene further because he was drunk, essentially failing to exercise reasonable care expected from a supervising teen host.

The case raises material issues of fact regarding whether Debbie and Junior's failure to exercise care after assuming control of the attendees, particularly the underage teenagers consuming alcohol and engaging in sexual activities, contributed proximately to Irsia's eventual injuries. Therefore, Irsia is granted the reversal of summary judgment in terms of negligence against Debbie and Junior, allowing the case to proceed further in the lower court concerning their liability.
