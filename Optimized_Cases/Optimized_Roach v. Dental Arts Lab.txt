Background:
Appellee Dental Arts Laboratory, Inc. sued appellant Anna Roach and Stan Horton for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. The district court ruled in favor of the company, leading Roach to appeal the decision. The key points in the case include:
- Roach had entrusted her car to Horton, who had a known addiction to crack cocaine, for repairs.
- Roach and Horton's mother were aware of his addiction but believed he had it "under control."
- Horton had previously been successful in repairing Roach's car without incident.
- On June 22, 1998, Roach lent her car to Horton again for repair work and job hunting.
- Horton did not return the car as promised, leading to Roach reporting it to the police.
- The car was involved in an accident and abandoned; the driver at the time was never found.
- Investigation suggested Horton may have loaned or sold the car for crack cocaine.
- A police officer testified that while someone with knowledge of an addict's habits might foresee the possibility of the car being given away, Roach would not likely expect that outcome.
- The officer, having experience with drug cases, believed Roach's decision to entrust the car to Horton, despite his progress, wasn't unreasonable under the circumstances.

Verdict:
The appellate court is expected to reverse the district court's judgment based on the reasoning that:
- The proximate cause has two elements: cause-in-fact and foreseeability.
- While Roach knew of Horton's addiction, there was no evidence suggesting she should have foreseen that he would exchange the car for cocaine.
- The court would note that general knowledge of an addiction does not equal specific knowledge of behavior such as exchanging property for drugs.
- Given Roach's prior experience loaning the car to Horton without issues, it would be unreasonable to expect her to predict the specific criminal act of exchanging the car for drugs.
- The act of the third party (unidentified driver involved in the accident) constituted a superseding cause, which was unforeseeable by Roach.
- The lack of foreseeability in the exchange of the car makes any negligence on Roach's part not the proximate cause of the company's loss.
  
Thus, the appellate court's decision would focus on the lack of foreseeability of the specific criminal act and deem it a superseding cause outside of Roach's control, resulting in a judgment that Dental Arts Laboratory, Inc. take nothing from Roach on its claim.
