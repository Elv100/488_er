Background:
On September 16, 1989, a police officer named Thomas Airington brought a lawsuit against a group of protesters who were demonstrating in front of the Reproductive Services Clinic in El Paso. Officer Airington alleged that while attempting to physically remove protester Sylvia Salazar from the clinic after she refused a police order to leave, he injured his back. He claimed that each of the defendants, who were part of the protest, were negligent and that their negligence proximately caused his injury.

The defendants were Samuel Oppenheim, the organizer of the protest, and other protesters named Maria Juhl, Breck Landry, Martha Arellano, Richard D. Weiss, Betty F. Jameson, Grace Madrid, Barbara Shepard Baldwin, Shirley Riordan, James Gose, and Aileen Gose. Airington's lawsuit accused the defendants of actions such as creating a dangerous situation for officers, not leaving premises upon lawful order, and failing to assist the police in the removing of Salazar and themselves.

Most of the protesters had decided to go to the clinic to disrupt activities by refusing police orders and potentially subjecting themselves to arrest. In doing so, they intended to adopt a passive resistance method which involved "going limp." Before the protest, they were advised on how to respond if confronted by police; however, it was left up to each individual whether to obey police orders or resist and face arrest.

Following discovery, all the defendants except Salazar and Oppenheim moved for summary judgment. They argued that they had no duty to prevent Salazar from injuring Airington, that their actions or inactions were not a proximate cause of Airington's injury, and that no defendant controlled any other protester. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and severed the remaining actions to make its judgment final and appealable. The court of appeals reversed this decision, claiming that the defendants had not conclusively disproved either duty or causation.

Verdict:
The verdict will center on the conclusion that there is no theory under which the participating demonstrators can be held liable for the injury sustained by Officer Airington. The court will render judgment that the plaintiff takes nothing since the police officer's injury was not a foreseeable consequence of the protesters' conduct.

The court will articulate that the actions of the petitioners were not "highly dangerous or likely to cause serious injury or death," which mitigates against the imposition of liability. Further supporting the petitioners' case is the emphasis on individual choice—each protester decided independently how to respond to law enforcement. The lack of direct control over one another amongst the protesters means that liability cannot be grounded in group association alone.

The opinion will underline that no existing Texas case law automatically imposes liability of group members for the misdeeds of an individual member within that group. If the demonstrators were part of an unincorporated association, the court will reason that even within that context, liability should not be imposed based solely on group affiliation.

The court will dispel the "concert of action" theory as a basis for the respondent's recovery, as it requires an agreement to perform a tortious act, and no evidence suggests that the defendants either agreed to injure the police officer or intentionally engaged in dangerous conduct. The absence of substantial assistance or encouragement to engage in a wrongful act will also undermine causation arguments.

Moreover, the court will not find any defendants' actions as significantly contributing to the harm — they neither provided moral support to Salazar nor had any direct control over other defendants' actions during the protest. With a lack of foreseeability of the injury, given the trained and expected competencies of police officers, the summary judgment evidence will be found conclusive in disproving any recognized or theoretical duty breached by the petitioners towards Officer Airington. The court's overall reasoning will reveal the significant barriers to recovery for the plaintiff under the facts and the rule of law applied, hence reversing the court of appeals' judgment and rendering judgment in favor of the petitioners.
