Background:
Appellant Maria S. Urena, suing on behalf of her minor child L.U., pursued legal action against the appellee, an apartment building known as Front Royale Apartments (identified alongside its owners and manager), due to personal injuries incurred from a sexual assault of L.U. on the premises. The apartment building had a history of violent crimes, including an attempted sexual assault, multiple robberies, and homicides between March 1997 and October 1999. The assault against L.U. occurred on November 6, 1999, when L.U. was lured into another tenant's apartment by Miguel Angel Zuniga and was subsequently assaulted. Although Zuniga had traffic offense convictions, he had no prior record for violent or sexual crimes and fled the scene before police arrived, remaining unfound.

The appellant alleged that the appellees were negligent and liable on the grounds of premises liability, among other claims. The appellees previously terminated their building security services without a replacement. The appellant contended the appellees were aware of various violent crimes within their premises yet failed to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of their tenants. The trial court initially granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of the building, dismissing all of the appellant’s claims, which led to the appellant's appeal, contending that there was sufficient evidence of negligence and duty breach regarding premises liability.

Verdict:
The judgment of the 269th District Court was expected to be reversed and remanded regarding the appellant’s premises liability claim on the basis that there was sufficient demonstrable evidence to establish material fact issues. In considering whether the sexual assault was foreseeable, the court needed to evaluate proximity, recency, frequency, similarity, and publicity of prior violent acts at or near the premises. Since the apartment complex had a history of violent crimes and management was aware of them, there appeared to be a foreseeable risk of harm, and therefore, a legal duty could potentially exist for the appellees to protect the tenants from third-party criminal acts.

Proximate cause might be established as the assault could be perceived as a foreseeable consequence of the appellees’ failure to provide adequate security. The appellant's allegations suggested that the appellees not only knew about prior incidents but also failed to use ordinary care in addressing the risks, as they lacked proper documentation for tenants and disregarded predetermined security measures by not maintaining security services. Such issues were predicted to raise doubts as to whether the appellees exercised ordinary care to prevent the crime.

Ultimately, the court was expected to conclude that material facts concerning foreseeable risk, duty, and breach thereof were to be decided by a trial, not at the summary judgment phase, due to the complexity and gravity of the claims involved. Therefore, it would be determined that the trial court's summary judgment in relation to appellant's premises liability claim was to be vacated, thus warranting a remand for further proceedings, while the remainder of the judgment pertaining to other claims (breach of contract, implied warranty of habitability, and violations of the DTPA) not being appealed remained affirmed.
