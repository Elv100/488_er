Background:
The appellant in this case is a guaranty company which challenged the judgment made in favor of the appellees—a deceased employee's widow and minor children—regarding an award under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Law. The award was initially made by the Industrial Accident Board due to the death of W. C. Rochester, an employee of the Lone Star Gas Company, who was killed by lightning on July 30, 1924, while working on excavating a pipeline. The guaranty company was dissatisfied with the award and argued that Rochester was killed by an act of God and was not engaged in any duties that exposed him to a greater hazard than the general public, thus claiming it should not be liable under Texas law (Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5246 82).

The evidence provided was substantial, including eyewitness testimony stating that at the time of his death, Rochester was digging a ditch along a pipeline with other men. It was an open, flat country area with few trees and no buildings nearby. It wasn't obvious that a storm was approaching, and the accident happened without warning. Witnesses also described the electrical conditions that presumably attracted the lightning strike to Rochester, including the steel shovel he was using and the steel pipe line he was working over.

The trial court decided in favor of the appellees (the widow and her children), affirming the award by the Industrial Accident Board. The guaranty company then appealed the decision.

Verdict:
In reviewing the appeal, the court held that the witness called by the appellees as an expert in electricity was competent, despite the company's objections, and that the trial court correctly overruled the company's objection concerning his qualifications. The evidence was deemed sufficient to sustain the jury's finding that the deceased was indeed engaged in the performance of duties that subjected him to a greater hazard from the act of God responsible for the injury than ordinarily applied to the general public.

The appellant’s complaints about the sufficiency of the evidence and the court's interactions with the expert witness on electricity were considered unfounded. The court found that while the cases cited by the appellant might suggest otherwise, those cases often had a distinct finding that there wasn't an unusual risk incidental to the employment, which was not the case here.

The appellant also raised objections to certain questions the trial court posed to a witness and the language used by counsel for the appellee during arguments, but these concerns were not found to be of a character warranting a reversal of judgment. The court determined that any possible prejudice by such actions was mitigated by proper jury instruction to ignore those elements.

Predicting the court’s reasoning and based on available evidence, it is likely that the court will uphold the trial court’s judgment, affirm that the jury's finding had ample support in evidence and testimony, and further hold that the qualifications of the expert witness were satisfactory. The court will also likely dismiss the appellant's concerns about the trial court's conduct and counsel's language during the trial as not materially prejudicial to the outcome, especially considering the jury had been instructed to disregard them. Thus, the verdict will likely be that the court will affirm the trial court’s judgment and overrule the company's motion for rehearing.
