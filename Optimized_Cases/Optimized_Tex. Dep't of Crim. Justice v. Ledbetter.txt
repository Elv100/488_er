Background:
The wrongful death lawsuit under review involves the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (the Department), which is the appellant challenging the partial denial of its plea to the jurisdiction by the 342nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas). The appellees are family members, including the mother (Bonnie Ledbetter) and other relatives of John Ledbetter, an inmate who died while in the custody of the Department. The Department’s employees are alleged to have misused a transport van, handcuffs, and other restraints, contributing to John's death. 

On June 27, 2008, John Ledbetter was found non-coherent and vomiting in his cell. Instead of calling an ambulance, correctional officers transported him to another prison facility for evaluation. John was placed in handcuffs and additional restraints and laid on his side in the backseat of the transport van because he was unable to protect himself from vomiting. The appellees claim that due to the restraints' misuse, John asphyxiated on his vomit, leading to his death. 

The Department contends that it is entitled to sovereign immunity, as governed by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2), and that John Ledbetter's death was not proximately caused by the use of tangible personal property, i.e., the restraints, arguing that the cause of death was congestive heart failure as determined by an autopsy. 

The evidence examined by the trial court includes witness statements from officers, nurses, and an inmate, as well as an autopsy report. Statements describe that John had vomited, was confused, shaking, and eventually became unresponsive. He was placed in a lying-down position in the van, and upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, he wasn’t breathing and had a very faint pulse. Testimonies noted John's purple skin color upon arrival at Robertson Unit, which is consistent with asphyxiation. The autopsy report, however, indicated no foreign objects or materials in the airway, listing congestive heart failure as the cause of death.

Verdict:
The Department's plea to the jurisdiction will be affirmed based on the evidence presented. The trial court's decision is mainly hinged on whether the Department's evidence conclusively disproves causation related to the misused restraints. Although the autopsy report lists congestive heart failure as the cause of death, it does not completely negate the possibility of asphyxiation, particularly since the timing of when John's airway was cleared is crucial to the findings. The evidence from witnesses suggests that he may have asphyxiated as a result of being restrained while actively vomiting, which could have prevented him from clearing his airway.

Since the Department has not provided definitive proof that John's symptoms upon arrival at the Robertson Unit were inconsistent with asphyxiation, the autopsy report’s finding that the airway contained no foreign objects does not conclusively disprove the appellees' claim that the restraints were a contributing factor to John's asphyxiation. Consequently, in light of the plaintiff's allegations and the evidence favoring the nonmovant, it is not demonstrated beyond doubt that the use of restraints was not a proximate cause of John Ledbetter’s death. Thus, the trial court did not err in its partial denial of the plea to the jurisdiction, and the plea's denial will be upheld, allowing the case to proceed under the Texas Tort Claims Act based on the alleged misuse of restraints.
