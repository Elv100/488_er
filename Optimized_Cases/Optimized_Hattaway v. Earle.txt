Background:
In this medical malpractice case, appellant Robert Hattaway underwent a back operation performed by Dr. Stephen Earle on April 4, 1991. The surgery involved the insertion of a metal bone plate, screws, and a bone growth stimulator. In a seminar prior to the surgery, a manufacturer's representative warned against the stimulator leads coming into contact with the metal plate or screws. Despite this, during Hattaway's surgery, Dr. Earle wrapped the stimulator leads around the metal screws.

In October 1992, Hattaway experienced a significant increase in pain. Dr. Earle and Dr. Murphy, to whom Earle referred Hattaway, provided various explanations for Hattaway's pain and discussed the possibility of hardware-induced pain and instability above the Steffee plates. Throughout the follow-up care, Earle provided reasons for the pain but did not definitively inform Hattaway of a failed fusion or loosened hardware. In March 1994, Hattaway's sister informed him about a 20/20 program discussing back surgery and the absence of FDA approval for the hardware used in his spine. Subsequently, Hattaway sought legal advice and, in May 1994, had surgery to remove the hardware.

Hattaway filed suit in January 1995, outside the two-year statute of limitations, alleging that Dr. Earle was negligent in the performance of the back surgery and in failing to disclose issues surrounding the surgery and follow-up care. Hattaway argued that the summary judgment was erroneously based on limitations, claiming Dr. Earle fraudulently concealed the negligence, and raised issues about whether Earle violated the standard of care during follow-up care. The trial court initially ruled in favor of Dr. Earle. Hattaway appealed, and the appellate court considered arguments regarding fraudulent concealment, the open courts doctrine, and alleged errors in follow-up care. 

Verdict:
As the appellate court evaluates the appeal, it first assesses whether Dr. Earle fraudulently concealed his negligence, which would toll the statute of limitations. The court identifies two aspects of fraudulent concealment: actual knowledge of the wrong and a fixed purpose to conceal the wrong. Given Dr. Earle's undisclosed modification of the surgical procedure by wrapping the stimulator leads around the hardware screws despite being warned against it, a fact issue arises regarding whether his concealment was purposeful and therefore fraudulentâ€”a critical point for determining whether the limitations period was tolled. In addition, the court will deliberate the open courts doctrine, which posits that the limitations period should not bar a cause of action before the claimant has a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit. Since Hattaway did not learn about the absence of FDA approval (which could be a sign of fraudulent concealment) until after the limitations period, applying limitations would violate the open courts provision.

The court evaluates the reasonableness of the delay in filing the suit post-discovery of the lack of FDA approval. It appears that nine months elapsed between Hattaway's discovery and the filing of the lawsuit. The reasonableness of this delay is typically a factual question, making summary judgment inappropriate if the evidence is favorable to the claimant.

Regarding Dr. Earle's summary judgment motion on follow-up care claims, the appellate court scrutinizes the requirements for granting summary judgment and the non-movant's burden of raising material fact issues. The court will likely find that Hattaway's evidence regarding Dr. Earle's alleged failure to disclose the potential loosening of hardware and the failed fusion could raise such facts. As these matters are not for resolution in summary judgment proceedings but rather by a jury at trial, summary judgment on follow-up care claims will likely be deemed inappropriate.

In conclusion, the appellate court will reverse the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Earle. The reasonings will include that there were fact issues related to fraudulent concealment and violation of the open courts doctrine concerning the surgery, and genuine issues of material fact concerning Dr. Earle's negligence in follow-up care. The case will be remanded for further proceedings.
