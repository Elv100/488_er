Background:
Lavern Bracy, the appellant mother, filed a wrongful death action against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. after her daughter, Shayla Stewart, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The daughter had a history of mental illness, including bipolar affective disorder diagnosed in 1999 and a commitment for mental health services in 2002 after being found mentally ill. On March 29, 2003, Stewart became agitated in a Denton, Texas Wal-Mart, assaulted her mother and another customer, and was subsequently escorted out and cited by the police for assault by contact.

On August 21, 2003, Stewart purchased a shotgun from a different Wal-Mart store, lying on the federal firearms transaction record by stating she had never been adjudicated mentally ill or confined to a mental institution. The form contained abbreviations and an illegible manager's signature. Stewart died a week later on August 28, 2003.

In her lawsuit, Bracy alleged negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence on the part of the store. Wal-Mart answered and filed for summary judgment claiming that they did not breach a duty of care to Stewart, did not proximately cause her death, and asserting two affirmative defenses: the 'unlawful acts' rule due to Stewart's false answers and a defense under Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code section 93.001(a)(2), which provides a defense where the plaintiff's injuries result from suicide. Wal-Mart further alleged that Bracy could not recover exemplary damages due to the Texas Constitution and that there was no evidence of breach, proximate cause, or gross negligence. 

The 362nd District Court of Denton County granted summary judgment without specifying the grounds. Bracy appealed, focusing on the issue of whether Wal-Mart's breach of duty of care was the proximate cause of her daughter's death, failing to argue against the summary judgment granted on Wal-Mart's affirmative defenses.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment on procedural grounds because Bracy did not address each of Wal-Mart's independent grounds for summary judgment in her appeal. Even if Bracy had raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding Wal-Mart's negligence, she waived her right to contest the summary judgment granted on Wal-Mart's affirmative defense of the suicide defense under Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code section 93.001(a)(2). 

Bracy did not dispute that her daughter committed suicide, which is the first element of the defense. The second element required Wal-Mart to show that Stewart’s suicide was the sole cause of the damages. Wal-Mart provided ample proof that Stewart appeared normal and did not exhibit any intent to commit suicide or harm others at the time of the firearm purchase. Furthermore, Wal-Mart provided an affidavit explaining that Stewart’s episode of violence at a Wal-Mart store did not necessarily indicate a mental health adjudication or commitment that should have been recognized by the store where she purchased the firearm.

Bracy’s strategy to allege Wal-Mart's 'lackadaisical' selling of firearms focused on procedural form errors, but she did not show how these errors constituted a breach of care that proximately caused Stewart’s death. Wal-Mart's counter-affidavit clarified that the paperwork errors did not relate to Stewart's eligibility to purchase the rifle and stated that Stewart’s false declaration on the form was the only illegal conduct in the transaction.

Ultimately, the appellate court will rule that Bracy did not produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Wal-Mart breached any applicable legal standards or that any such breach was the cause of her daughter's death. Consequently, the court will determine that since Wal-Mart established the defense of suicide as the sole cause of Stewart's death, summary judgment was correctly granted, leading to affirmation of the trial court's decision in favor of Wal-Mart.
