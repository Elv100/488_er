Background:
The lawsuit was brought by William Maxwell and other adult children of the late Nancy Tasker against a railroad company, following an accident where a pipe connected to a heater on a train operated by the appellant railroad company exploded. The explosion caused significant damage to the train car and very much frightened Nancy Tasker, who was a passenger on the train. Although she did not sustain any external injuries, she experienced pain and vomited blood later that day. Over the subsequent months, she was treated for pneumonia and ultimately died of tuberculosis in November, eight months after the accident.

The central question was whether the train accident was the proximate cause of Nancy Tasker's death. The appellees argued that the traumatic event and subsequent "nervous prostration" weakened her condition to a degree that she became susceptible to tuberculosis. Before the incident, Tasker was in good health. The railroad company's defense was hinged on the argument that there was a lack of evidence showing the injuries sustained in the accident caused or even could cause tuberculosis, and they requested multiple instructions to be given to the jury, further contending issues with the amount of damages and double recovery.

Counsel for the appellant railroad company cited various authorities in support of their contention that the facts essential to the plaintiffs' cause of action were not proven, particularly that Nancy Tasker's death was not a result of the train accident. The appellant argued that the requested instructions should have been given – such as one regarding the concurrence of tuberculosis and injuries received from the accident leading to death, and another concerning assessments of damages made by the jury.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment entered in favor of the children in their negligence action against the railroad company. It is likely to be reasoned that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to determine whether Nancy Tasker received injuries from the train accident and that those injuries did not cause her death but possibly made her susceptible to the tuberculosis that did.

The court will likely address the appellant's assignments of error, concluding that the trial court rightly refused the peremptory instruction requested by the defendant because the evidence warranted that the central issues be decided by the jury. As for the issue of the proximate cause, it appears that while the evidence supported the finding that injuries occurred due to the accident, it did not conclusively prove that those injuries caused the tuberculosis that led to Nancy Tasker's death.

Further, the court will likely maintain that the damages awarded to the plaintiffs were not for the loss due to death but for injuries sustained while Nancy Tasker was alive and grounded on the argument that the claims survive to the heirs, citing Article 3353a of the Revised Statutes.

It is to be anticipated that the appellant’s arguments regarding double recovery in the damages and the misdirection in jury charges will be dismissed on the account that the trial court properly instructed the jury and that any alleged errors were non-material to the outcome since the facts stated in testimony were uncontradicted and supported by evidence presented in court.

The court will uphold the jury's role as the arbiter of evidence and witness credibility and reject the argument that the verdict was against the preponderance of the evidence, noting that the jury's verdict seemed to be supported by the evidence and was not influenced by prejudice or misunderstanding. Consequently, the verdict against the railroad company will stand, with the reasoning heavily relying on the jury's right to make determinations on the evidence presented.
