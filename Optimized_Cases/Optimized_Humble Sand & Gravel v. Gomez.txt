Background:
The worker (appellee) filed a lawsuit against the sand supplier (appellant) for personal injuries attributed to the use of silica-based abrasive supplied by the appellant to his employer for abrasive blasting work. Documented connections between silica sand and silicosis have been known in the industry since the 1920s, with safety codes enacted as early as 1938. The appellee performed abrasive blasting from 1984 to 1987 and contracted subacute silicosis, reducing his life expectancy by 20 to 25 years. The appellee had used the protective equipment but sometimes inadequately.

The warning on the product at the time stated, "May be injurious to health if proper protective equipment is not used." The appellee testified that he used an air-supplied hood and a paper dust mask for protection, assuming the hood was for protecting his face from rebounding particles and the mask for nuisance dust. The particles causing silicosis are invisible and can be inhaled without an awareness of danger. The appellant provided a Material Safety Data Sheet and Technical Fact Sheet to the employer that recommended using air-supplied hoods for "eye protection" but did not explicitly mention silicosis or its harmful effects.

In 1993, the appellant enhanced the warning labels following the appellee's diagnosis. Information known about the risks of silica dust and safety procedures when they first began selling the product in 1982 was only communicated in the revised warning labels in 1993. Under Texas law, a product is unreasonably dangerous without adequate warnings.

The appellant argued that they provided sufficient warning and maintained a "sophisticated user defense," claiming they were absolved from failure-to-warn liability on the premise that the product was only sold to industrial businesses who should know the risks. Appellant argued that they could reasonably rely on the intermediary (employer) to warn the ultimate consumer (employee). The trial court, however, found against the appellant, denying the "sophisticated user defense" and upholding that the appellant still had a duty to warn the appellee.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court examined several factors, including the magnitude of the risk, the product’s danger, the warnings provided, the intermediary's ability to communicate risks to the users, and the burden on the supplier to warn users directly.

In this case, the product was dangerous, and the warnings did not inform the appellee of the health risks or the proper safety measures. Despite some knowledge of risks at Spincote (appellee's employer), there was evidence that Spincote did not fully comprehend the hazards or adhere to proper safety standards. Therefore, the intermediary could not be considered a reliable conveyor of the necessary safety information to the appellee. Given silicosis can lead to severe health complications and death, the risk was significant, and the burden on the appellant to place an adequate warning on the bags was minimal.

The sophisticated user defense did not absolve the appellant because there was no reasonable assurance that the employer (intermediary) would inform and protect employees. The reliance on the employer to provide warnings was not reasonable due to the foreseeable deviations from necessary safety practices. According to Restatement (Second) of Torts § 388, if the product is highly dangerous and practical means are available for the supplier to directly inform users, such measures must be taken, especially when the supplier cannot reasonably trust the intermediary to do so.

Given this, the appellate court concluded that the appellant retained the duty to provide adequate warnings to the ultimate user and that their failure to do so justified the verdict. The sophisticated user defense was unavailable to the appellant based on the evidence. The appellate court also did not find error in the trial court's decision to exclude certain evidence concerning causation or its refusal to instruct the jury on the sophisticated user defense. Therefore, the judgment in favor of the appellee was affirmed.
