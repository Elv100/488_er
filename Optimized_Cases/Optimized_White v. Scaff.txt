Background:
Mrs. Christina White, the deceased, was a patient of Dr. Bruce Scaff. She was 38 years old, had undergone a kidney transplant as a teenager, and was suffering from stage four renal insufficiency at the time of the events in question. On September 26, 2005, Mrs. White visited Dr. Scaff complaining of severe right leg pain. Dr. Scaff diagnosed her with a stress fracture and renal failure and prescribed Hydrocodone w/APAP 5/500 # 25. She returned to see Dr. Scaff on October 3, 2005, still in pain, and he additionally prescribed Oxycontin ER 20 m.g. # 50. Mrs. White also saw a kidney specialist as per the referral from Dr. Scaff. On October 6, 2005, after taking the medications, Mrs. White became ill and briefly went to the hospital. She died at home on October 8, 2005. The cause of death reported in the autopsy was the ingestion of Oxycontin and Hydrocodone.

The appellants, acting as representatives for Mrs. White’s estate and others, filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Scaff, implying that the prescriptions he provided were improperly dosed given Mrs. White's renal condition, leading to lethal levels of narcotics in her blood and her subsequent death by overdose. They introduced expert testimony from Dr. Clive Fields and Dr. Horacio Adrogue, asserting that Dr. Scaff breached the standard of care, which included asserting that Mrs. White's leg pain was misdiagnosed and that the real cause was her statin medication, not a stress fracture. As a result of Dr. Scaff's prescriptions of Hydrocodone and Oxycontin, which were reportedly too high due to her renal insufficiency and also because the combination of these drugs without adjusting their dosage is highly toxic, Mrs. White's death ensued. The trial court excluded the testimonies of the expert witnesses and granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Dr. Scaff, suggesting that there was a lack of expert evidence to show causation in Mrs. White's death due to the excluded testimonies.

Verdict:
In predicting the outcome of the appeal, the appellate court will likely reverse the trial court’s decision to exclude the expert testimonies of Dr. Fields and Dr. Adrogue. The appellate court will find that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the expert testimonies, which were indeed based upon reliable evidence and thus, met the admissibility requirements under Tex. R. Evid. 702. The expert testimonies were grounded in scientific knowledge that was anchored in the methods and procedures of science, and they were designed to assist the trier of fact in making a determination on a key issue in the case—whether Dr. Scaff's prescription practices for a patient with severe renal insufficiency constituted a breach of standard of care that led to Mrs. White’s death.

The appellate court will determine that Dr. Fields and Dr. Adrogue are both qualified experts whose insights were based on a combination of scientific reports (autopsy and toxicology), medical literature, personal experience, as well as the principles of pharmacokinetics and the specifics of renal insufficiency's impact on drug metabolism. They both utilized differential diagnosis in making their medical determinations, a technique acknowledged and valid for reliability analysis, and their foundational data included medical records, pharmaceutical records, autopsy and toxicology reports, and established medical literature, which concede no significant potential rate of error.

Furthermore, the appellate court will dismiss the summary judgment granted to Dr. Scaff because, upon consideration of the expert testimonies, there is more than a scintilla of evidence, when reviewed in the light most favorable to the appellants, to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning Dr. Scaff's negligence and the causation of Mrs. White’s death. The summary judgment will also be overturned on issues regarding negligence in diagnosing the leg pain and the misprescription of Oxycontin and Hydrocodone. However, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's summary judgment regarding the appellants’ lack of claims on gross negligence and punitive damages, as the appellants have stipulated they would not seek these damages and provided no evidence to suggest gross negligence.

The case, consequently, will be remanded to proceed with the witnesses' testimonies admitted for consideration in further proceedings, except for the affirmed part related to gross negligence and punitive damages.
