Background:
Waleska Biaggi was injured as a passenger in a single-car accident caused by the intoxicated driver, Julio Rivera, who had been served alcohol at Patrizio's restaurant, where he worked. Biaggi took Rivera to work on the day of the incident and borrowed his car to visit a friend, but ended up driving the vehicle into a ditch and later required a tow truck. She never made it to her friend's house and had to pick Rivera up from the restaurant at the end of his shift. Upon her arrival at Patrizio's, Rivera was drinking heavily and was visibly intoxicated. Biaggi sat and drank with Rivera and a customer at the restaurant and informed the manager that she would drive both of them home. However, Rivera insisted on driving because she had earlier ditched his car. Despite knowing about Rivera's intoxication, Biaggi, without considering alternative transportation options and citing the fact it was late, decided to let Rivera drive.

While driving out of the restaurant parking lot, Rivera was traveling at high speeds, resulting in loss of control and collision with a commercial pole on the passenger side, leaving Biaggi unconscious and injured. Rivera was legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, while Biaggi was not. Biaggi admitted in her deposition and testimony that she knew the signs of intoxication from her experience in the restaurant industry, understood the dangers of drinking and driving, previously caused accidents due to impairment, and acknowledged making the wrong decision by riding with Rivera. However, she also expressed that she did not expect things to turn out as they did.

Biaggi sued Patrizio's under the Texas Dram Shop Act, alleging that the restaurant continued to serve Rivera when it was clear he was dangerously intoxicated. Patrizio's sought summary judgment, contending that because Biaggi chose to ride with Rivera knowing he was intoxicated, this act constituted a new and independent cause that broke the chain of proximate cause between the restaurant's actions and Biaggi's injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Patrizio's, and Biaggi appealed. The appellate court assessed whether Patrizio's had negated proximate causation as a matter of law and applied the proportionate responsibility framework to determine the extent of Biaggi's contribution to her injuries.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Patrizio's by determining that the restaurant did not conclusively prove that Biaggi's decision to ride with Rivera severed the causal connection between Rivera's intoxication and Biaggi's injury. The court will also establish that it is a jury's responsibility, not a court's, to apply comparative negligence analysis to establish the degree of Biaggi's responsibility. If the jury finds that her negligence was over 50% the cause of her injuries, she would not be entitled to recover damages. However, the court will conclude that Patrizio's liability is not ultimately extinguished by Biaggi's decision to ride with an intoxicated driver.

To predict the reasoning for the verdict, the appellate court will apply several factors from the case law related to the concept of a new and independent cause, which did not convincingly negate the proximate cause on Patrizio's part. It will be found that Biaggi's action in riding with an intoxicated Rivera is not an outside agency separating the causal link, and Biaggi's negligence – even if substantial – does not entirely alleviate the restaurant's liability for serving an obviously intoxicated patron who went on to cause an accident.

The court will reason that Biaggi's actions were not so unforeseeable to be considered extraordinary, and that the injuries resulted from a series of events not entirely detached from Rivera's intoxication and the restaurant's decision to serve him alcohol. Furthermore, since Biaggi's conduct did not create a new and independent cause, it does not outright dismiss the liability of Patrizio's under the Dram Shop Act. Instead, any negligence assigned to Biaggi will be assessed under the Texas Proportionate Responsibility Act during a trial, where jurors will determine the percentages of responsibility among Patrizio's, Rivera, and Biaggi. The appellate court will send the case back to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with their opinion, rejecting the application of summary judgment and allowing for a full jury evaluation of the comparative responsibilities.
