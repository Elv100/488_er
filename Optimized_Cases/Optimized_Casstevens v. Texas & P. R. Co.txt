Background:
Albert Casstevens, an employee of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, was injured when a piece of steel flew from a hammer and injured his finger. After the initial injury, he continued working for 14 days before seeking medical treatment and ultimately filed a lawsuit against the railway company for damages resulting from the injury. Casstevens claimed that the hammer, which was allegedly provided by the railway company, was defective due to being made of poor material and having been in long use, making it brittle and prone to flaking off in slivers. He alleged that the defects were known, or should have been known, by his superiors, Bill Dyer and D. W. Aiken, who were agents of the defendant, but they failed to furnish him with a non-defective hammer. This failure, Casstevens argued, constituted negligence and was the proximate cause of his injury.

Furthermore, Casstevens claimed that before the incident, he had notified his superiors about the hammer's defective condition and had been promised a new one, which he never received. He contended that his continued use of the hammer was not contributory negligence since he was acting under the promise of getting a replacement. During the trial, the plaintiff identified the hammer as the one that caused his injury, which the railway company's witnesses (Aiken and Dyer) denied having provided to Casstevens. Additionally, the defendants argued that railway employees would regularly bring their own tools for work. Furthermore, the testimonies of Aiken and Dyer, who had denied the conversations about the hammer defects and their promise of providing a new hammer, had been contradicted by Casstevens.

Casstevens' case went to a jury trial, where special issues were submitted regarding whether the railway company had furnished the hammer, whether the injury was brought to the attention of the superiors, promises made concerning a new hammer, knowledge of the defective hammer, and the cause of the plaintiff's illness. The jury's findings concluded that the hammer was not furnished by the company, was not defective, and that Casstevens' illness was a result of a disease rather than the workplace injury. There were also findings pertaining to the plaintiff's ability to have procured another hammer himself, the absence of contributory negligence on his part, and whether the injury was the result of an unavoidable accident.

During post-trial proceedings, allegations of juror misconduct emerged. A juror testified that the jury had preliminarily agreed to make decisions based on the majority rule rather than consensus, but the trial court did not grant a mistrial based on this alleged juror misconduct.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, essentially upholding the jury's verdict. The court found that the jury's determinations that the hammer was not furnished by the railway company, was not defective, and that the employee's illness was the result of a disease were in compliance with Casstevens' pleadings. Since the jury found that the illness was not caused by the workplace injury, any potential error in the instructions to the jury regarding the railway's negligence was considered harmless. 

The court also found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to grant a mistrial based on the alleged juror misconduct. The trial judge has considerable discretion in determining the impact of juror misconduct on the verdict, and the appellate court did not find that the trial judge had abused that discretion. 

Additionally, the appellate court reasoned that the agreement among jurors to determine their decision by a majority vote negated neither the jury's unanimous consent to the final verdict nor their individual responsible decisions. This conclusion was evidenced by the jurors' assent, through nodding or silence, when the court inquired if they agreed with the verdict. Thus, the appellant's right of recovery had been addressed appropriately based on the issues submitted to the jury, aligning with the pleadings. The jury's additional finding that Casstevens' illness resulted from disease independently validated the judgement, regardless of other findings about the hammer's condition or the company's negligence.
