Background:
On October 2, 1997, Dr. Mitchel Wong, a board-certified ophthalmologist affiliated with Austin Eye Clinic Association, conducted cataract surgery on George W. Graham's left eye. Postoperatively, Mr. Graham, a 73-year-old man at the time of trial, developed a series of complications that led to the complete loss of sensitivity to light in that eye. His subsequent treatment involving other physicians culminated in an additional surgery known as the "Gunderson flap" procedure, which he found disfiguring. The jury determined that the appellants' negligence proximately caused Mr. Graham's injury. They assessed damages for physical pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care at $200,000 for past damages and $462,500 for future damages; prejudgment interest increased the past damages to $248,690.53.

Following the surgery, Mr. Graham experienced substantial inflammation and decreased vision, eventually losing all light perception in the operated eye. Multiple medical experts testified on proximate cause and foreseeability, alleging Wong's failure to diagnose and treat either endophthalmitis or uveitis adequately – both possible postoperative conditions. Dr. Wong suggested Graham had non-infectious inflammation (uveitis), while independent experts proposed undiagnosed endophthalmitis, an infection requiring immediate intervention, as the cause of the vision loss. The evidence also critiqued the care provided by Wong, lack of appropriate testing, and insufficient chart documentation. Wong testified that he believed his treatment was appropriate, citing Graham's diminished likelihood of healing and the potential for pre-existing conditions contributing to the loss of vision.

The appellants raised issues concerning the use of evidence pertaining to an unrelated lawsuit involving Wong, sufficiency of the evidence for causation and damages, and the necessity of the damages awarded. Wong and the clinic argued that there was no clear segregation between damages caused by their care and other factors. However, sufficient evidence suggested that the Gunderson flap procedure, which resulted in Graham’s disfigurement, was the inevitable consequence of the appellant's treatment, and thus, appellants were held responsible for the resulting condition and disfigurement.

Verdict:
In affirming the judgment, it will be reasoned that appellee, George W. Graham, presented sufficiently detailed and compelling evidence proving both correctness and damages. The jury's decision is supported based on testimony from medical experts that Graham’s vision loss resulted from undiagnosed and inadequately treated endophthalmitis or, alternatively, uveitis. They posit that the appellants either failed to diagnose and treat the correct postoperative condition or properly manage Graham's persistent non-responsive uveitis, leading to his vision loss. The contention that Graham’s eye condition was worsened and his disfigurement resulted from long-term steroid eye drops used under Wong’s prescription will be supported. Further, it will be acknowledged that appellants did not sufficiently document Graham’s pain or effectively communicate his condition to subsequent doctors, exacerbating the persistence of his infection.

Additionally, it will be concluded that all damages suffered by George W. Graham were a direct result of appellants' treatment. Challenges to the award for damages for pain and mental anguish, impairment, disfigurement, and medical expenses will be dispelled based on the jury's prerogative to assess such compensations. Present and past evidence of Graham's significant physical and emotional pain, his functional impairments due to vision loss, and ongoing mental anguish will substantiate the jury's awards for both past and future damages. Any attempt by appellants to attribute the damages or their extent to factors other than their treatment will be dismissed as the evidence linking appellants’ negligence to the injuries and damages incurred by Graham is legally and factually sufficient. Thus, the judgment will be affirmed, upholding the significant award of over $700,000 in damages and prejudgment interest to Mr. Graham.
