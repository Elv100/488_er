Background:
Nathaniel Cooper, who was diagnosed with a congenital heart block, underwent multiple heart surgeries, had four pacemakers, and suffered lasting heart damage from malfunctioning pacing wires. Employed by UPS as a supervisor, he worked in an un-air-conditioned warehouse in Houston and was placed on light duty due to his heart condition and a previous cardiac event. On June 3, 2005, Cooper collapsed at work, suffering a heart attack that led to his death. The medical examiner attributed his death to heart complications.

Terrica Barnes, Cooper's fiancée and the mother of his son Kainan, filed a workers' compensation claim under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act as next friend of the child. However, the claim was denied by the DWC hearing officer based on the finding that Cooper's work was not a substantial contributing factor to the cardiac arrest, instead attributing it to the natural progression of his preexisting heart condition. This decision was not appealed by Barnes and consequently became final.

Barnes then filed a wrongful death lawsuit against UPS alleging gross negligence, accusing UPS of failing to install proper ventilation and to shield employees from excessive heat. UPS moved for summary judgment, arguing the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel, suggesting Barnes's claim had already been litigated and resolved in the workers' compensation forum. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS.

Barnes appealed, disputing the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel. She contended that her right to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence, as a surviving heir, is constitutionally and statutorily protected, and that different factual and legal questions are pertinent to the gross negligence claim compared to the workers' compensation claim.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's summary judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings because the issues resolved in the prior workers' compensation claim are not identical to those presented in the gross negligence lawsuit. While both proceedings entail the same underlying facts, Barnes couldn't have raised the gross negligence claim before the DWC, which means the claim is not barred in the subsequent lawsuit.

Additionally, the causation burden under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 408.008 for the workers' compensation claim necessitates the demonstration that Cooper's work was the predominant factor contributing to his heart attack, as opposed to the natural progression of his preexisting heart condition. This is distinct from the causation burden in a gross negligence claim, where the plaintiff must establish that the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing injury but does not have to be the primary or sole factor.

Because establishing a claim under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 408.008 involves a unique and more stringent comparison or weighing of factors beyond what is required in a gross negligence case, the issue of causation was not fully and fairly litigated in the workers' compensation hearing in the context necessary for a gross negligence claim. Thus, Barnes is not barred by either res judicata or collateral estoppel from pursuing her gross negligence suit against UPS.

The appellate court will highlight these distinctions in causation standards and the inability to raise the gross negligence claim during the DWC proceedings to justify its reversal of the summary judgment. The court will likely affirm the right of an heir or surviving spouse to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence independently of the workers' compensation system, aligning with constitutional and statutory protections.
