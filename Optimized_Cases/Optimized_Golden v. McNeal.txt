Background:
William David Golden was charged with possession of a controlled substance, represented himself pro se initially, and then had attorney Donald Ray McNeal and investigator Shirley Alfred Johnson appointed to assist with his criminal defense. Following his conviction and the exhaustion of the appeals process, which included the affirmation of his conviction by the Texas Court of Appeals, refusal of his petition for discretionary review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, and denial of his petition for writ of certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court, Golden received a forty-year prison sentence. 

After his appeals were completed, Golden sued McNeal and Johnson on the grounds of professional malpractice, negligence, violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. Most of Golden's claims alleged that McNeal failed to properly object, question witnesses, or argue certain issues during trial. Golden's grievances against Johnson were primarily focused on her alleged failure to locate potential character witnesses. There were extended difficulties with service of process, particularly with respect to McNeal.

Both defendants argued that any damages claimed by Golden were solely due to his own criminal conduct. Additionally, they contended Golden's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, and McNeal also argued that Golden lacked diligence in serving process. Summary judgment was granted separately in favor of Johnson, labeled "Partial Summary Judgment," and McNeal, labeled "Final Judgment."

On appeal, Golden contended that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment, failed to address the issue of service of process, refused to file findings of fact and conclusions of law, declined to hold a hearing on the motion for new trial, and did not act on the motion to disqualify the visiting judge.

Verdict:
In reviewing the case, the appellate court would likely determine that Golden could not sue investigator Johnson for her conduct during his criminal defense because the proximate cause of any damages resulting from his conviction was his own criminal behavior, consistent with precedent from the Peeler case. As Golden did not develop any breach of contract claims specifically against Johnson, and she did not have a fiduciary duty to him, it would be anticipated that Johnson's summary judgment would remain upheld. The appellate court would not find any breach of contract or fiduciary duty claims against Johnson in Golden's petition.

Concerning Golden's action against attorney McNeal, it is predicted that the appellate court would find that the lawsuit was not time-barred by the statute of limitations because the timeframe would be tolled until all of Golden's rights of action in his criminal appeal had been exhausted. With McNeal acknowledging that he had filed an answer in the case, the appellate court would deduce that the requirement for serving a citation upon him was rendered moot, thereby indicating that the summary judgment in favor of McNeal was erroneously granted.

In addressing the remaining issues raised by Golden, it would be established that findings of fact and conclusions of law are not applicable in summary judgment proceedings. Concerning the refusal to hold a hearing on the motion for new trial, courts generally do not have an obligation to hold a hearing when motions are overruled by operation of law. Lastly, since there was no evidence of any timely objection or motion to disqualify the visiting judge, it would be deduced that there was no error on this matter by the trial court.

Thus, the appellate court would reverse the summary judgment granted to attorney McNeal, remand that portion of the judgment for further proceedings, and affirm the judgment in other respectsâ€”particularly the summary judgment granted to investigator Johnson.
