Background:
The case involves a lawsuit filed by E.J. Mitchell and his wife, Estella Mitchell, against the appellant, a streetcar company, alleging negligence. The incident occurred on June 4, 1919, around 11 p.m., when the Mitchells were aboard a streetcar operated by the company. They intended to alight at a usual stop near Collins Garden in San Antonio, but the streetcar did not stop at the designated place. Instead, the car stopped in a location where the tracks were two or three feet above the street grade and there were surrounding weeds, making the area difficult to see at night.

E.J. Mitchell, who had signaled for the stop a block earlier, disembarked with a baby in his arms and, realizing the hazard, warned his wife to be careful. She followed but fell while alighting, injuring herself with one foot out and the other bent under her. They were unaware that the streetcar had overshot their intended stop. Mrs. Mitchell was pregnant at the time, unbeknownst to Mr. Mitchell, and she was considered a healthy individual before the fall.

Following the accident, Mrs. Mitchell's health deteriorated. She gave birth to a child approximately nine months later, but both she and the newborn experienced significant health issues following the delivery. The child passed away a few months after birth. Mrs. Mitchell reportedly started coughing about three weeks post-injury and her condition worsened until her demise on April 11, 1920.

Medical evidence presented at trial indicated that Mrs. Mitchell had been healthy prior to the accident, having recovered from the influenza epidemic in 1918. There was no evidence of tuberculosis at that time, according to Dr. Stout, an expert specialist who had examined her in 1918. However, her health declined rapidly following the accident, leading to tuberculosis which, as argued, was a result of her injuries.

The District Court, after considering the presented medical testimonies, ruled in favor of Mr. Mitchell and his minor child, Edward Leonard Mitchell, awarding them a total of $10,000 in damages, apportioned as $3,000 for E.J. Mitchell and $7,000 for Edward Leonard Mitchell.

Verdict:
Given the precedent established in the Groner Case and other related citations, the court in the present case will affirm the judgment against the streetcar company. The reasoning for this verdict will focus on the fact that the company's negligence did not have to be the immediate cause of death but merely a contributing factor. The injury sustained by Mrs. Mitchell, as found by the jury, was sufficient to significantly weaken her powers of resistance to the onset of tuberculosis, which ultimately hastened her death. Even if Mrs. Mitchell had a predisposition to tuberculosis, the aggravation and acceleration of the disease due to the injury would still render the streetcar company's negligence a proximate cause of her death.

It will be argued that the injury acted as a catalyst for the tuberculosis infection by lowering her bodily defenses, and this weakened state allowed the disease to develop and expedite her demise. The court will highlight that the testimony was consistent, and the jury was within its rights to determine that Mrs. Mitchell's health prior to the fall was robust. They were also entitled to conclude that the accident and the resulting injuries were the primary reasons for the subsequent decline in her health and eventual death. There was no intervening cause shown between the streetcar company's negligence and Mrs. Mitchell's death that could mitigate the company's responsibility.

The streetcar company's appeal, which challenges the sufficiency of evidence and the connection between the injury and tuberculosis, will be found lacking as there was enough conflicting medical testimony to enable the jury to find in favor of the Mitchells. The verdict will not be considered excessive because the amount corresponds with the loss and suffering experienced by the Mitchells, which the jury deemed to be a direct consequence of the negligent act. Additionally, the law does not require that the defendant or its employees should have foreseen the specific result of their actions, only that some injury could naturally result from the negligence. The streetcar company's petition on the grounds of excessive verdict and newly discovered evidence will not be grounds for reversal. Every case holds unique facts that must be considered on their own merits when assessing damages. Therefore, the court's final judgment will lean towards affirming the lower court's decision and upholding the damages awarded.
