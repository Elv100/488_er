Background:
Robert Jerry Davis experienced an "impingement" in his left shoulder following a work-related incident, which was initially treated with physical therapy and ultimately with arthroscopic surgery performed by Dr. James Harris. Post-surgery, physical therapy was recommended for rehabilitation. Mr. Davis preferred undergoing therapy at Baylor Medical Center in Gilmer, Texas, where it was overseen by Johnny Lee-On, a licensed physical therapist, Penney Downey, a college student intern training to be a physical therapist assistant, and a third person functioning similarly to a secretary.

While engaged in therapy using a machine called the "Total Gym," Mr. Davis noticed that it was malfunctioning and informed Ms. Downey, who attempted to make adjustments. On a subsequent set of exercises, with Mr. Lee-On not present and Ms. Downey temporarily out of the room, the machine again malfunctioned, causing Mr. Davis's left arm to be pulled over his head, resulting in excruciating pain.

Dr. Harris examined Mr. Davis after the incident, noting worsened condition and difficulty in motion. A subsequent MRI revealed a torn rotator cuff, which required a second surgery. Dr. Harris's testimony indicated that the worsened condition and injury were consistent with the exercise machine incident described by Mr. Davis.

Mr. Davis's life was adversely affected following the incident, as he was in constant pain, unable to do ordinary activities, and lost his previously held job that paid $2,500 per month. His wife also felt the impact, as it affected their relationship and she lost her job due to the time needed to care for him, though she obtained employment later.

The Davises alleged that Rehabilitative Care Systems of America (RCSA) was negligent for not properly supervising Mr. Davis during the use of the Total Gym. Expert witnesses for both sides testified about the expected standard of care and procedures in such therapy settings.

Verdict:
The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The argument that expert testimony was necessary to establish the standard of care was rejected because the negligence claimed did not involve sophisticated medical treatment decisions, but rather the supervision of a patient handling potentially dangerous equipment, which falls within the understanding of average jurors. The Davises adequately showed through both lay testimony and expert opinions that a physical therapist should be in the vicinity of the patient to respond to any issue during such therapy sessions, and this did not require medical expertise to understand.

In terms of causation, expert medical testimony indicated that there was a reasonable medical probability of a causal connection between the injuries suffered by Mr. Davis and the lack of proper oversight during his exercise on the Total Gym. Dr. Harris testified that although he could not factually confirm the incident, the worsened condition and subsequent findings were consistent with the type of accident described by Mr. Davis.

For RCSA's contention about the factual insufficiency of evidence, the court deemed the jury's verdict as not being against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. It did not find the verdict to be manifestly unjust or indicating any bias. The Davises' account of the incident and the testimony supporting the consequential damages presented a reasonable basis for the jury's decision.

Given the testimony and evidence provided, including the worsening of Mr. Davis's condition after the incident and the standard of care expected in such therapy settings, the verdict leaned toward a decision favoring the Davises. All factors considered, the decision to affirm the trial court's judgment appears well-founded on the principles of negligence, specifically duty, breach, causation, and damages.
