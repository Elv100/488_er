Background:
Appellants Anthony F. Ambrosio, Jr. and Linda W. Ambrosio, individually and as Personal Representatives of the Estate of Alek W. Ambrosio, sued appellee Carter's Shooting Center d/b/a Carter's Country, a Texas corporation that operates gun stores, following the murder of their son, Alek, who was killed during a car jacking. The murder happened after a gun, previously stolen from one of appellee's stores, was used by the perpetrator, Jaime Guerrero. The appellants alleged four causes of action: negligence, negligence per se, strict liability, and gross negligence, claiming that appellee violated its duty to exercise proper care in the storage and display of firearms.

The gun, a nine millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun, was stolen by Rafael Monsivaiz from an unlocked display case at appellee's Katy Freeway store. After the theft, the gun was sold and changed hands multiple times before ending up with Guerrero. Appellee had knowledge of prior gun thefts from its stores, including a past incident where a stolen gun was used in a murder.

Appellee filed a general denial and a third-party action for contribution and indemnity against those directly involved in the carjacking and murder and moved for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment. The trial court granted the traditional motion and denied the no-evidence motion.

The appellants raised four points of error on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there were disputed material facts regarding foreseeability and causation; (2) the trial court erred in excluding government reports and expert witness affidavits; (3) the trial court erred in denying a motion for continuance; and (4) the trial court erred in denying a motion for new trial.

Verdict:
The ruling that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellee will be affirmed due to the legal principle that disproves the element of proximate cause, specifically cause in fact, as a matter of law. In this context, proximate cause requires both foreseeability and cause in fact. Foreseeability exists as appellee might have anticipated the danger that lax security could lead to stolen guns being used in crimes. However, cause in fact necessitates that the negligent act be a substantial factor in the injury, without which the harm would not have occurred. It must be shown by evidence that is substantive and not merely speculative, and cannot just furnish conditions that made the injury possible.

Here, appellee's failure to secure the firearms only created a condition that allowed the theft to occur. This, however, was too remote from the murder to constitute a legal cause. The chain of events from the theft to the murder included multiple transfers of the gun and a temporal, geographical separation between the store and the crime scene.

Given that cause in fact was negated as a matter of law, the negligence and negligence per se claims were correctly dismissed. There is no substantial evidence that directly connects appellee's conduct to the crime in a way that would not have happened otherwise. With regards to the second and third points, the evidence and testimony that were excluded would not raise additional material fact issues on the element of cause in fact. Denial of the motion for continuance was within the trial court's discretion as any further evidence would not affect the determination of cause in fact. The fourth point, along with the cross-points by appellee, become moot given the trial court's correct application of law in granting summary judgment.
