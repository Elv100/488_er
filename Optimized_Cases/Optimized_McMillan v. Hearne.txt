Background:
This case involves a personal injury lawsuit filed by Kelly Shane Hearne against his employer, Charles Duncan McMillan d/b/a Anthony Sign Company (McMillan), on November 2, 2016. McMillan is a nonsubscriber to the worker's compensation system. The incident in question occurred on September 14, 2015, when Hearne, who had been employed by McMillan for approximately twenty-five years, attempted to restore the marquee sign of the Grand Theatre in Paris, Texas. Hearne initially failed to reach the sign using the bucket of a company bucket truck and then decided to access the roof from the interior of the theatre. He asked McMillan to bring a thirty-foot-long extension ladder from his truck to aid in this attempt.

Upon McMillan's arrival, he and Hearne positioned the ladder to access the attic of the theatre, with McMillan holding the ladder from the bottom as Hearne ascended. When Hearne reached the attic and discovered that his flashlight was not working, he communicated his need to descend for a functioning flashlight or batteries. However, while descending, Hearne saw McMillan walking away, which he believed led to the ladder slipping and his consequent fall to the concrete floor, resulting in severe injuries requiring multiple surgeries.

McMillan contested these events, claiming that when he left to get the flashlight, Hearne and the ladder were stationary on the floor, and he never supported the ladder nor witnessed the fall.

The Occupational Injury Benefit Plan established by McMillan covered $65,271.88 of medical costs and past wages, along with a $250 deductible personally paid by McMillan. Hearne sued McMillan for negligence, and after a trial, the jury ruled in Hearne's favor, awarding him $162,818.38 in past damages and $265,000.00 in future damages. McMillan appealed, seeking an offset for the amounts paid to Hearne by the Occupational Injury Benefit Plan and contesting the jury's findings. The trial court found McMillan was entitled to a $91,911.02 offset and entered a judgment for the amounts awarded by the jury, less this offset. Hearne cross-appealed, asserting errors including the trial court's handling of past damages and the offset applied. The appeals court took up the matter to decide these issues.

Verdict:
The appeal will result in the affirmation of the trial court's judgment as modified. Regarding McMillan's liability for Hearne's injuries, the court will find that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish negligence on McMillan's part. Hearne's testimony that McMillan ceased supporting the ladder served as some evidence of negligence since McMillan owed and breached a duty to provide a safe working environment, including adequate assistance for safe work performance.

In relation to proximate cause, Hearne's fall and subsequent injuries will be considered foreseeable consequences of McMillan's negligent action. The foreseeability will rely on McMillan's own admission that he would never leave someone alone on the ladder due to the potential dangers. Given that and Hearne's recount of events, the jury had enough information to determine that McMillan's negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries.

Addressing the handling of damages, the appeals court will find that the trial court was within its discretion in determining an offset of the past damages post-verdict since there was no factual dispute over the amounts paid by the Plan, rendering the collateral source rule inapplicable. The substantial and primary purpose of the plan was for the employer's protection, rather than a fringe benefit for the employee. Hence, the trial court's award of the offset was not in error.

However, the appeals court will hold that McMillan is entitled to an offset of $65,521.88 rather than the $91,911.02 applied by the trial court. The greater amount improperly included payments made to third-party negotiators, which were not direct benefits described by the Plan as eligible for offsets against any judgment. Consequently, the judgment will be modified to reflect the correct offset amount, resulting in an award of $97,296.50 for Hearne's past damages. As modified, the trial court's decision will be affirmed.
