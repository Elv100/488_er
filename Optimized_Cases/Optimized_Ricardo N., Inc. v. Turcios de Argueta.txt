Background:
Juan Luis Argueta was a seaman on the shrimping vessel the Betty N, owned by Ricardo N., Inc. He jumped overboard in the middle of the night approximately eighty miles off the Texas coast. It is speculated that he was distressed over rumors of his wife's infidelity. After jumping, the crew radioed for help and searched for him throughout the night, but he was not found.

Argueta's wife, Maria Margarita Turcios de Argueta, filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself, Argueta's estate, and their four minor children, alleging negligence under the Jones Act (46 U.S.C.S. § 688) and unseaworthiness under the Death on the High Seas Act (46 U.S.C.S. § 761). The trial court ruled in favor of Turcios, awarding actual damages, punitive damages, and pre- and post-judgment interest. The court of appeals reversed the punitive damages and judgment against the vessel but affirmed the actual damages and interest against Ricardo N. The case then went to the Supreme Court of Texas for further review.

The trial court had determined that the Betty N was unseaworthy due to improper equipment and lack of crew training for emergencies. The ship did not have flares or cable cutters to jettison the nets in an emergency, and it was questionable if the ship's life preservers met Coast Guard regulation requirements. The crew members lacked emergency training, and safety materials were in English when only the rigman could read English. The use of sideband radios was unclear. The crew's response to the overboard incident lacked immediacy and the vessel lacked the proper emergency equipment, impacting the potential for a successful rescue operation.

Ricardo N. denied that adequate evidence supported findings of unseaworthiness and negligence but did not argue reversal based on this. Instead, Ricardo N. contended that there was no evidence the unseaworthiness and negligence could have caused Argueta's death.

Verdict:
Given that the plaintiff (Turcios) bore the burden of proving causation in both the Jones Act negligence claim and the unseaworthiness claim under the Death on the High Seas Act, and considering the available evidence, it is predicted that the court will rule that she failed to meet this burden. The verdict should assert that Turcios was required to demonstrate that the defendant's (Ricardo N., Inc.) actions or lack thereof, resulted in Argueta's death, but despite the light burden of proof required under the Jones Act (where a defendant's negligence only needs to contribute 'in the slightest degree'), Turcios could not establish causation.

The argument that the crew should have thrown flotation devices to Argueta will be dismissed on the basis that he was not visible once he entered the water, and that speculative actions without proof of causation are insufficient grounds for liability. The plaintiff’s own expert's testimony that even if everything had been executed perfectly by the Betty N, it would likely not have changed the outcome, will be particularly influential in determining the lack of causation.

The traditional requirement for proximate cause in unseaworthiness claims will not be met either, as no evidence will be able to show that the vessel's condition or the crew's actions could have prevented Argueta's death.

Additionally, the court will likely consider that Argueta's own actions in jumping overboard under risky conditions at night without a life vest made it extremely challenging for Ricardo N. to disprove causation. Thus, pursuant to cases like Britt v. Marine Transport Lines and Schlichter v. Port Arthur Towing, where the plaintiff's inability to prove causation resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants, the court will find that Ricardo N. did not breach any statutory or regulatory requirement, and equitable considerations do not favor a presumption of causation against them. As a result, the verdict rendered will be that Turcios should take nothing against Ricardo N., reversing the appellate ruling and affirming the judgment in favor of Ricardo N., Inc. to the extent permissible by the reviewed claims.
