Background:
Paul Tatum was the son of John and Mary Ann Tatum. At seventeen, he was involved in a severe car accident on his way home from a fast-food run. No evidence suggested he was under any substance influence, but the crash was significant. Paul made his way home, began drinking, and called a friend, indicating erratic behavior. Concerned, the friend visited and found Paul with a firearm. After the friend left the room to alert their parent, a gunshot was heard; Paul had killed himself. The Tatums, linking research on traumatic brain injuries to suicidal ideations, concluded the accident caused Paul's mental state leading to his suicide. They wrote an obituary stating Paul died "as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident," wishing to attribute his suicide to the accident rather than a mental illness. Over 1,000 attended Paul’s funeral.

Columnist Steve Blow wrote a piece in The Dallas Morning News titled "Shrouding Suicide Leaves its Danger Unaddressed," critiquing the tendency to disguise suicides and quoted Paul's obituary without naming the Tatums. The column indicated that Paul's death was suicide, previously undisclosed in the obituary, and emphasized the importance of openness regarding suicide. Blow did not contact the Tatums before writing, and they recognized the article referenced their son. 

The Tatums sued for libel and libel per se against Blow and the paper, claiming the column had a defamatory gist. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants without specifying reasons. On appeal, the court held that the column could be construed to suggest that Paul suffered from untreated mental illness and that his parents failed to honestly confront it, which is defamatory, and remanded for libel claims. The appellate court did not find the column to be an opinion and rejected every possible summary judgment ground.

The News petitioned for review, arguing: the column isn’t capable of defamatory meaning; it expresses non-actionable opinion; it is substantially true; and the court of appeals failed in analyzing actual malice.

Verdict:
The column is reasonably capable of implying that the Tatums acted deceptively in their wording of the obituary, and this implication can be defamatory. However, the accusation will be considered an opinion because the context of the column, using a first-person, informal style with subjective statements, indicates it is presenting a subjective viewpoint rather than an objective assertion of fact. Although the article does not refer to the Tatums by name, the implication that they were deceptive is evident, as Blow uses their obituary as an example to support his viewpoint on society's handling of suicide. 

Moreover, the column’s statement regarding the Tatums’ alleged obituary deception is true. The obituary led readers to believe in a cause of death (automobile accident) that wasn't entirely accurate as it omitted the critical fact of suicide, regardless of the Tatums’ reasons or beliefs. Blow’s column merely reveals the truth that the obituary left out, and therefore it cannot be more damaging to the Tatums' reputation than what is true. Consequently, the trial court's grant of summary judgment will be reinstated, ruling in favor of Blow and The Dallas Morning News, on the grounds that the accusation in the column was an expression of opinion and was, to the extent it implied deception, a true statement.
