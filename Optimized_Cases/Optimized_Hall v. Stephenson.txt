Background:
The appellant, Julie Anne Fagan Hall, filed for divorce in 1987 and was represented by six different attorneys during her divorce proceedings. Post-divorce, Hall sued her former attorneys and law firms, along with her consulting accountant, alleging professional malpractice, gross negligence, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Her allegations against the attorneys were that they failed to perform their duties properly, such as not filing inventories and appraisals, not seeking sanctions against her ex-husband for non-compliance, and withdrawing from her representation without adequate cause. With regard to her consulting accountant, she claimed he failed to testify about a conflicting 1986 corporate tax return during her divorce trial.

The attorneys filed motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted after severing the claims into two suits. Hall attempted to file motions for new trials, which were initially granted on limited questions about overlooked assets, but later the summary judgments were reinstated when Hall did not properly respond to the court's questions. Hall then appealed the reinstatement of the summary judgments, acting pro se, claiming that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding her claims, and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate. Her appeals involved questioning the procedural conduct of the trial court, including assertions that a new trial had been improperly granted and challenging the basis on which the summary judgments were affirmed.

Verdict:
The appellate court upheld the summary judgments in favor of all appellees, finding Hall's arguments unpersuasive. The court applied the legal injury rule to establish that the second attorney was not liable for malpractice, as Hall's claim against him was filed outside of the statute of limitations. In terms of the remaining appellees, the court determined that Hall failed to establish a prima facie case for attorney professional malpractice based on negligence due to lack of evidence about the producing cause of liability. Hall also did not succeed on her claims of gross negligence because she failed to provide competent controverting evidence that demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the challenged element. Regarding her DTPA claims, Hall's actions were considered barred by the Act's statute of limitations.

The court's reasoning was that Hall did not provide evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Hall's affidavits, used to respond to the summary judgment motions, were either based on preliminary opinions or referred to a large volume of attached documents without specifically interpreting them or identifying where they demonstrated genuine issues. By not properly guiding the court through the evidence to point out material factual disputes, Hall effectively failed to meet her burden as the nonmovant in a summary judgment situation. Thus, the summary judgments were affirmed on the basis that Hall did not properly toll the applicable statutes of limitations and could not demonstrate a producing cause for liability under the DTPA.
