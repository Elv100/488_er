Background:
Alfredo and Frances Moreno, plaintiffs, brought a medical malpractice action after their daughter, Bernadette Moreno, died at Del Sol Medical Center under the care of Dr. Edward Juarez and Physician Assistant Roy Malphurs. Bernadette was in hypertensive crisis, experiencing respiratory distress with high blood pressure and low blood oxygen saturation. Nurse Ruddy informed Cardiologist Dr. Joseph Quintana about Bernadette's condition at around 3:30 a.m., after which Dr. Quintana ordered medication to lower her blood pressure but did not physically examine her. Despite treatment, her blood pressure remained elevated. After an attempt to prepare Bernadette for a CAT scan using contrast dye, she went into emergency respiratory distress due to congestive heart failure. Dr. Adolfo Palomino attempted intubation, during which Bernadette went into a pulseless electrical heart rhythm and died following complications from the failed intubation.

The parents filed suit against Dr. Quintana and Del Sol Medical Center alleging medical malpractice and negligent credentialing of Physician Assistant Malphurs. The defendants filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted, leading to take-nothing judgments against the Morenos. The trial court sustained objections to exclude expert witness testimony from Dr. David Ostrander and struck documentary evidence of Dr. Quintana's orders for Bernadette’s treatment.

On appeal, the Morenos argued the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence and contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgments. The appellate court evaluated whether the trial court properly excluded evidence, including expert affidavits and deposition testimony, and whether summary judgment was correctly awarded under no-evidence grounds on the issues of breach of standard of care and proximate cause.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court’s awards of summary judgment, as the trial court improperly granted both motions. First, on evaluating whether Dr. Quintana breached the standard of care, the issue will focus on what information Nurse Ruddy provided to Dr. Quintana during the 3:30 a.m. call. The credibility of Nurse Ruddy's account that he indeed informed Dr. Quintana of Bernadette’s vital signs will play a crucial role because it contradicts Dr. Quintana's assertion that he lacked sufficient information to warrant a personal evaluation of Bernadette. Since summary judgment is improper when the resolution of a material fact relies on the credibility of witness testimony, the trial court will be found to have erred in this respect.

Regarding the proximate cause element, the evidence will suggest that Dr. Quintana’s failure to provide aggressive treatment contributed to Bernadette's deterioration and subsequent need for intubation. Thus, a fact issue will exist on causation as the Morenos presented more than a mere scintilla of evidence that could lead reasonable minds to different conclusions about the cause of death.

As for the negligent credentialing allegations against Del Sol Medical Center concerning Physician Assistant Malphurs, the court will hold that Texas Occupations Code Section 160.010(b), which offers immunity for credentialing activities absent malice, does not apply to the credentialing of a physician assistant. Therefore, the Morenos will not need to demonstrate malicious intent, as such credentialing does not necessitate this higher burden.

Ultimately, since native evidentiary rulings and the trial court's no-evidence summary judgment grounds will not support the court's judgment, the appellate court will sustain the appeal based on the issues raised by the Morenos and remand the case for trial. The court will underscore that genuine issues of material fact exist, and issues of witness credibility and weight are the province of the fact-finder rather than summary adjudication. The reversal will allow the Morenos the opportunity for a trial to examine the full extent of the evidence and determine liability for the alleged malpractice and negligent credentialing.
