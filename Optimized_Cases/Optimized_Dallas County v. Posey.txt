Background:
Bryan Posey was arrested for assaulting his mother. During the intake process at the jail, Posey denied having attempted suicide in the past or currently having suicidal thoughts or tendencies. The intake officer failed to complete a part of the Mental Disability/Suicide Screening Form, specifically the section evaluating whether Posey was a risk for medical issues, mental health concerns, or suicide. Despite this omission, Posey was seen by a nurse for an injury on his hand, who then referred him to a psychiatrist for an anger management evaluation. Initially, Posey was placed in a holding cell with a cordless telephone, from which he made several harassing calls to his mother. His mother requested that the calls stop, resulting in Posey being transferred to another cell that contained an inoperative corded telephone. Tragically, Posey used the cord from this inoperable telephone to hang himself and commit suicide.

Following his death, Posey's parents filed a negligence lawsuit against the county, alleging that the county was negligent in assessing Posey's risk of suicide and in placing him within a cell that had a corded telephone. It came to light that the county had previously ordered the replacement of corded phones with cordless models, which suggested awareness of the potential suicide risk associated with telephone cords. The county responded by filing a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that it was immune from lawsuit under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. ยง 101.021(2). Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals denied the county's plea, prompting the county to appeal to the supreme court.

Verdict:
The supreme court will decide whether governmental immunity is waived in the case where a prisoner used a telephone cord to commit suicide, as per Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code ยง 101.021(2). The court will determine that the county's immunity is not waived, citing that the county merely allowed Posey to use its property (the telephone cord) without causing the incident themselves. The court will distinguish between mere provision of property and actual causation by government use, paralleling Posey's case with Cowan, where the government also did not misuse tangible property, but rather the patient misused it.

The court will observe that the failure of the county to replace the corded telephone with a cordless one constitutes a non-use or misuse of property, which does not waive immunity under the aforementioned statute. Moreover, the court will conclude that the condition of the telephone (exposed wires) having a defective nature, was not proximately causing Posey's death as it would need to pose a hazard in its intended and ordinary use. Since the exposed wires did not actively cause the injury, this precludes establishing the necessary causal nexus between the condition of the property and the injury.

Lastly, the quality of Posey's suicide risk assessment would be deemed irrelevant to the county's immunity status, even if Posey had been identified as a suicide risk. This is because the assessment did not have a direct bearing on the county's placement of Posey in the cell with the corded phone which he used in his suicide. The court will affirm that governmental immunity remains intact under the narrow conditions that waive immunity, which the court finds absent in this situation.

Therefore, with these reasons, the court will grant the county's petition for review, vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, and dismiss the case.
