Background:
National Health Insurance Company ("National Health"), an underwriter, entered into a business relationship with CRS Marketing Agency ("CRS") and National Plan Administrators, a third-party insurance administrator owned by CRS. National Health contracted with CRS to exclusively market their policies, while National Plan Administrators would handle administrative tasks. The relationship was formalized through a "Request for Proposal" process and legal agreements which delineated responsibilities and profit-sharing.

Over time, CRS began searching for other insurance carriers and eventually entered negotiations with Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford"). While still under contract with National Health, CRS, through its owner, Sommerlatte, started facilitating the transfer of National Health's active-at-work policies to Hartford, sharing proprietary policy information with them.

National Health's insurance rating was declining, and their book of business was not growing. CRS took advantage of this to make deals with Hartford. When National Health planned to exit the market, it was negotiating with United Teachers Insurance Association to sell the policies but allowed National Plan Administrators an opportunity to find an alternative buyer. However, CRS and National Plan Administrators worked towards moving the policies to Hartford on an active-at-work basis, without fully informing National Health of the actions or intentions, causing National Health to lose a significant part of its book of business.

National Health filed suit, alleging breaches of contract and fiduciary duties, as well as trade secret misappropriation, seeking damages and attorney's fees. The jury found CRS and National Plan Administrators operated as a single business enterprise, found breaches of contract and fiduciary duty against National Plan Administrators, and awarded damages. The trial court rendered a judgment for actual and exemplary damages.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. Overall, the court deemed that National Plan Administrators owed National Health a general fiduciary duty, grounded in the statutes regulating third-party administrators, the specific details of the written agreements between parties, and the broader common-law principles concerning the duties of agents. The jury's findings, which assessed that CRS and National Plan Administrators functioned as a single business enterprise, were supported by the evidence showing the intermingling of operations and the presentation of both entities as a unified front in negotiations. The actively-at-work offer was directly tied to National Plan Administrators' actions constituting a breach of fiduciary duty, and the evidence suggesting malice was sufficient under the definition stipulated in the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. ยง 41.001(7)(B) (1997), as the acts involved extreme risk and indicated a conscious indifference to the rights of National Health.

Despite CRS's contention that the single-business-enterprise doctrine was not a valid theory under Texas law for imposing joint liability, the court determined that the doctrine was appropriate for piercing the corporate veil in this scenario given the integrated business operations and common pursuit of business aims by CRS and National Plan Administrators. Consequently, the imposition of damages, notably punitive damages, jointly against CRS and National Plan Administrators did not contravene Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. ยง 41.006, and thus was ruled permissible by the court.
