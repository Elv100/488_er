Background: The underlying incident is a three-vehicle freeway collision that resulted in one death and serious injuries. Evelyn Lane (decedent) ran over debris and stopped her car on the freeway. Thomas Hurst (plaintiff driver) stopped his postal truck behind her. Defendant driver, operating a tractor-trailer owned by defendant corporation, subsequently hit Hurst's truck, causing it to collide with Lane's car, which led to an explosion. Both Lane and Hurst filed negligence actions against the defendant driver and corporation, seeking damages for the collision. These suits were consolidated and tried before a jury. The jury found Lane to be 30% negligent, Hurst 30% negligent, and the defendant driver 40% negligent. The trial court awarded plaintiffs 70% of the damages. The defendants appealed, claiming that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of a potential fourth vehicle's involvement. The witness, Joseph Horn, was prevented from relaying a statement from the driver of this fourth vehicle—a light-colored pickup—which could corroborate the defense's account of the accident circumstances. They also claimed the exclusion of evidence about a gasoline can in Lane's car affected the causation issue, arguing it directly contributed to the fire and Lane's death. The defendants further contended that the trial court erred in its submission of general negligence and proximate cause issues to the jury, the severance of the third-party claim, and the treatment of contributory negligence in the final judgment.

Verdict: The court will likely reverse and remand for a new trial, finding errors in the trial court's handling of the excluded witness testimony and the gasoline can evidence. The testimony about the fourth vehicle's involvement, regarded as a spontaneous declaration under the hearsay exception rules, was improperly excluded, which likely prejudiced the defendants' case. The defendants should have been able to present the gasoline can as part of the causation evidence, considering its potential role in the fatality. Therefore, these exclusions probably impacted the jury's verdict. Regarding the general negligence and proximate cause issue, the court will probably recognize concerns related to the combined submission of negligence and proximate cause but may not consider these to warrant reversal due to the defendants' insufficient specificity in their trial court objections. However, a more specific submission upon retrial may be suggested to avoid ambiguity. The court will likely not find that Mrs. Lane's estate was an indispensable party since the defendants had the responsibility to include them and did not sufficiently show diligence. However, a motion to consolidate third-party action in the retrial may be given consideration. The negligence attributed to Lane in carrying a gasoline can may be deemed relevant to damages but not as a contributory negligence factor in the accident. The court will also likely address the allocation of negligence among parties and how it affects each plaintiff's award. The comparative negligence statute may be interpreted as requiring each plaintiff's recovery to be assessed separately, without considering the negligence of the other plaintiff. This arrangement avoids altering substantive rights due to procedural consolidation. The percentages of negligence may not need to total 100%, and each plaintiff’s recovery may be diminished in proportion only to their own negligence compared to the defendant's negligence. Therefore, the defendants' request to diminish plaintiffs' recovery or dismiss the case on combined negligence will likely be refuted. The court will address these and potentially other issues, setting forth a verdict that mandates a fair and legally sound retrial.
