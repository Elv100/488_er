Background:
Russell Engledove, an employee of O. L. Gregory Vinegar Company, died while attempting to rescue a fellow employee, Thomas Nelson, from a vinegar vat filled with poisonous gas. The incident occurred on October 29, 1914, during a regular cleaning process necessary for the vinegar manufacturing operation. Engledove, while eating his lunch, responded to a cry for help from Herman Ingram, the company's foreman, and disregarded warnings about the danger. He wrapped a saturated gunny sack around his head and entered the vat to assist Nelson, successfully attaching a hook and rope to Nelson's belt for extraction. However, Engledove was overcome by the gas and perished.

Appellant, the General Accident, Fire & Life Assurance Corporation, Limited, an insurance carrier for the vinegar company, contested the claim that Engledove was acting within the scope of his employment when he died, thus challenging an award set by the Industrial Accident Board of Texas, favoring Engledove’s widow, Alice Engledove, and their minor children. Appellant's position was that Engledove's actions were contrary to express commands from superiors and thus situating him outside the scope of employment and eligibility for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Texas.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, upholding the judgment confirming the award by the Industrial Accident Board. The rationale was that where an employee's life is jeopardized through the employer's negligence, a third-party, who intervenes to rescue them, is not simply volunteering but is acting in the interest of the employer. Thus, their actions are within the scope of employment, and eligibility for compensation follows. Engledove's intervention was seen as an attempt to preserve life that was in the vinegary company's interest, as employers depend on the lives and labor of employees. Whether Engledove's actions were against a direct command was for the trial court to determine, and the court found no commanding evidence to suggest such instruction was given as an authoritative command, but rather as a suggestion of danger. If a command were proven, the question arose whether that would render Engledove's action outside the scope of employment and disentitle benefits under the Act—a perspective that wasn’t definitively concluded. However, the court opined that a servant's violation of a master's orders, while acting within their employment scope, might not deny them compensation claims.

Finally, the court also addressed the legality of the judgment itself regarding installment liabilities, affirming that the compensatory approach aligns with the statute and that due execution can be enforced if installments are not voluntarily paid. The judgment was fully upheld as the court concluded that Engledove was entitled to compensation, and the decision of the Industrial Accident Board stood as conclusive and final, with the trial court's judgment affirmed.
