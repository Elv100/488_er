Background:
The appellant, a telephone company, appealed against a judgment made by the District Court of Llano County (Texas), which was in favor of the appellee, a husband whose wife was struck by lightning and sustained serious injuries while inside their home. The lightning was alleged to have been conducted into the house through the company's wires. The home that the husband and wife moved into previously had telephones from both the appellant company and another business, and when the telephones were removed, the company's wires were left in place. It was presented in evidence that the company did not employ a lightning arrester, a common device used to prevent such accidents, and there was conflict over whether the wires were properly grounded and disconnected from the main line. Testimony indicated that a lightning arrester was more effective than grounding the wires, and the most secure way to prevent lightning danger was to completely remove the wires, which was not done by the appellant company. The trial court ruled in favor of the husband, awarding damages for personal injuries to his wife and the diminished capacity of the wife to perform household duties and earn money.

The appellant company contended that the court's charge to the jury was erroneous and misleading, suggesting that it would be negligent for leaving wires in a residence after removal of the telephone instrument if those wires could conduct lightning. The appellant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's award for the diminished capacity of the wife to discharge her duties and earn money.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court based on the evidence that shows the injury to the appellee's wife was caused by the negligent failure of the appellant company to remove its wires from the house or to safeguard the wires with approved appliances to prevent injury from lightning. The court will hold that the telephone company owed a duty not just to use precautions known to it or its agents, but to exercise reasonable care in selecting and using the best methods known to science to protect from such injuries, considering it operated a dangerous agency.

The court will find that the failure to give a requested special charge about the grounding of the wires as protection was not error. It will reason that elementary care required is higher than just using methods known to the company; it involves taking all reasonable precautions known to prevent lightning damage.

The court will further determine that the main charge, when read with other parts of the charge and an additional special charge given at the appellant's request, was not significantly erroneous or prejudicial to the appellant company.

Regarding the jury’s award for the wife's diminished capacity, the court will conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the award. It will refer to the principle that the value of a wife's services can be inferred from the nature of her injuries and can be assessed by the jury without direct testimony regarding their monetary value. The jury's common knowledge and the circumstances in which the husband and wife lived are deemed sufficient for them to ascertain a reasonable value for such loss of services.

Taking all the evidence into consideration, the court will find that there is no reversible error in the trial court’s judgment or the jury's verdict, and will thereupon affirm the judgment against the telephone company. Writ of error will be refused, upholding the ruling in favor of the appellee husband.
