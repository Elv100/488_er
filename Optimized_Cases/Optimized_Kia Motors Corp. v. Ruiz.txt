Background:
Andrea and Lawrence Ruiz owned a 2002 Kia Spectra. On January 16, 2006, Andrea was driving with her daughter Suzanna as the front-seat passenger, both wearing seat belts, when they were involved in a head-on collision with a truck driven by Harvey Tomlin. While Suzanna's air bag deployed causing minor injuries, Andrea's did not, ultimately leading to her death at the scene from severe neck injuries. The Ruiz family sued Kia Motors Corporation and Kia Motors America, Inc. (collectively, Kia) claiming that the air-bag system was defectively designed, specifically faulty wiring connectors, leading to the failure of Andrea's air bag to deploy during the collision.

The jury found that Kia's negligence in the design of the vehicle's air-bag system was a proximate cause of Andrea's injury, with responsibility for the injury apportioned 45% to Kia and 55% to Tomlin. They awarded the Ruizes compensatory and exemplary damages, though punitive damages were later dismissed because the jury was not unanimous on Kia's negligence. The trial court's final judgment awarded the Ruizes $887,400 in damages, and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.

Further details of the case involve the discussion of section 82.008 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which offers a nonliability presumption to manufacturers if their product complies with federal safety standards. Kia argued that its air bag design complied with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), specifically FMVSS 208, and therefore, it was entitled to this presumption. However, the court found FMVSS 208 does not govern the risk of an air bag's failure to deploy, but rather assumes deployment and measures occupant protection, making the presumption inapplicable in this case.

Other issues included whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other similar incidents from a spreadsheet containing 432 paid warranty claims, only 67 of which involved the same error code related to Andrea's case. The court concluded that although some of the claims were admissible, many were not relevant to the underlying proceedings, consequently the admission of the spreadsheet as a whole was deemed erroneous.

Verdict:
The Texas Supreme Court will likely hold that although the trial court correctly refused to apply the statutory presumption of nonliability to Kia, as FMVSS 208 did not govern the product risk of an air bag failing to deploy, the trial court committed reversible error by admitting the spreadsheet of warranty claims. The Supreme Court will conclude that the evidence of the code-56 claims on the spreadsheet, which implicated the same connectors as in the Ruiz case, could have been admissible for their design-defect finding. However, admitting nearly 85% of other irrelevant claims based on the spreadsheet without proper distinction between relevant and irrelevant claims will be seen as prejudicial to Kia.

Additionally, the verdict will likely emphasize that while the Ruiz family provided sufficient evidence to support their claim of a design defect, the errors in admitting the spreadsheet potentially influenced the jury's judgment due to the volume of irrelevant information presented. Thus, the Supreme Court will find that the error probably resulted in an improper judgment, leading to reversing the trial court's decision and remanding the case for a new trial, focusing on the relevancy and proper admission of similar incident evidence. The verdict might also likely address procedural aspects regarding objections and limiting instructions under the Texas Rules of Evidence.
