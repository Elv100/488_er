Background:
Dorman Smith, a self-employed drywaller finisher, utilized joint compound products in his work from around 1955 to the mid-1980s. In early 2005, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma—an aggressive cancer commonly associated with asbestos exposure. Following the diagnosis, Dorman and his personal representatives, Rosemary Smith, Brady Smith, and Donna Hubbard (collectively, the Smiths), initiated a products liability lawsuit against several defendants, including Kelly-Moore Paint Company, Inc. (Kelly-Moore), alleging that Dorman's mesothelioma was proximately caused by exposure to asbestos in the defendants' joint compound products. Dorman Smith died on December 9, 2005, after the lawsuit had been filed.

The case was moved to the 11th District Court for pretrial proceedings. Kelly-Moore moved for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, maintaining that there was insufficient evidence that asbestos exposure from its products was responsible for Dorman Smith’s mesothelioma. The basis for their argument was the substantial factor causation test from the case Borg-Warner Corp. v. Flores, requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate frequent, regular, and proximate exposure to the product as well as reasonable quantitative evidence of increased risk. Following the court's decision for a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore, the case returned to the 153rd District Court for trial, but with all other claims against remaining entities either settled or dismissed, the summary judgment against Kelly-Moore stood as final, prompting the Smiths' appeal.

During the initial and appellate procedures, various pieces of evidence were presented. Dorman had worked with many brands of joint compound, including Kelly-Moore's, which he used until the mid to late 1970s—around the time Kelly-Moore removed asbestos from its products. Brady Smith testified to using Kelly-Moore ready-mixed joint compound on a "pretty regular basis" but less frequently than others due to its cost. Dorman's son also provided estimated percentages concerning the time spent sanding and mixing joint compound on the job.

Dr. Ronald Dodson conducted a tissue burden analysis of Dorman's lungs post-mortem, finding chrysotile fibers longer than those commonly found in the lungs of the general, non-occupationally exposed population. Patricia Hall offered an estimate of Dorman's exposure duration and fiber count, while Dr. William Longo provided fiber release measurements corresponding to typical work activities involving joint compounds. All evidence pointed towards exposure exceeding recommended limits.

Dr. Arnold Brody and Dr. John Maddox provided expert opinions on causation. Dr. Brody spoke to the general capacity of asbestos fibers, regardless of type or length, to cause genetic errors, while Dr. Maddox explicitly connected significant exposure to asbestos dust with Dorman's mesothelioma, criticizing the concept of a minimum threshold of exposure above background levels as "logical nonsense." Maddox also cited studies indicating that various forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are capable of causing mesothelioma.

Verdict:
In determining the verdict, the appellate court will uphold the trial court's judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore. The court will have noted that, while there is some evidence to suggest how often Dorman used Kelly-Moore's products, and therefore of his exposure to its compound, the Smiths will not have provided sufficient scientific evidence of a minimum threshold of exposure to chrysotile asbestos alone that poses an increased risk of developing mesothelioma. Given the precedent set in the Borg-Warner case, the court will expect the Smiths to offer a quantifiable level of exposure to Kelly-Moore's compound that could be considered a substantial factor in causing Dorman's mesothelioma.

While the Smiths will raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the Lohrmann factors (frequency, regularity, and proximity of exposure), there will have been no evidence to pinpoint a minimum threshold dose of chrysotile asbestos from Kelly-Moore's product above which mesothelioma does not occur. The absence of this crucial information will be most influential in the court's reasoning, supported by the Smiths' failure to distinguish between different asbestos types in epidemiological studies and lacking correlation in case reports and animal studies between exposure thresholds and the increased risk of mesothelioma.

Ultimately, the court will emphasize that the Borg-Warner "substantial factor causation test" applies to all asbestos-related claims, regardless of the asbestos disease type. Thus, without the necessary minimum exposure level evidence, expert testimonies will be seen as lacking the required foundation to raise a fact issue as to specific causation. Therefore, the Smiths' inability to establish specific causation, as required by Borg-Warner standard, will be the key to the court affirming the summary judgment in favor of Kelly-Moore.
