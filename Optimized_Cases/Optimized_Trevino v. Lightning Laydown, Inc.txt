Background:
This case involves a wrongful death and survival action brought by the appellant survivors against the appellee tortfeasor, International Bank of Commerce (IBC), following a deadly collision caused by a detached trailer which struck the vehicle of Jose Trevino. The plaintiffs also included other defendants in their suit - the owner of the trailer, Lightning Laydown, Inc., its manufacturer, Garber Industries/South Texas Tong, Inc., and the driver, David Riley. All parties except IBC settled before trial through a "Mary Carter" settlement agreement.

At trial, the jury found that IBC was 5% at fault for the accident due to negligence and that the settling defendants were 95% at fault. The jury identified IBC's conduct as gross negligence—a want of care indicative of a conscious indifference to the safety of others—but did not award exemplary damages, only compensatory damages proportional to IBC's 5% fault, totaling $110,300. The appellants argued that, due to the finding of gross negligence, IBC should be responsible for the entire amount of damages found by the jury, not just the percentage corresponding to its assigned fault. They contended that the trial court incorrectly applied the comparative negligence statute, asserting that the statute did not cover actions based on gross negligence.

The appellate court had to determine whether the comparative negligence statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2212a, applied to the case even though gross negligence was found, and whether gross negligence was a separate cause of action from ordinary negligence that could not be compared for the purposes of reducing damages under the comparative fault framework.

Verdict:
Considering the reasoning set forth in previous relevant Texas cases, such as Burk Royalty Co. v. Walls and Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., the verdict will maintain the application of the comparative negligence statute. The court is likely to uphold the trial court's award of damages based on the percentage of fault allocated to the appellee IBC. The comparative negligence statute allows for tortfeasors' respective fault to be compared, and damages to be apportioned accordingly. The court will argue that one cannot be grossly negligent without being negligent; hence, the underlying finding of negligence permits the application of the comparative negligence statute. The appellants' argument that gross negligence is a separate and distinct cause of action will not be persuasive to the court because under Texas law as iterated in Burk Royalty, gross negligence is considered an elevated form of negligence not entirely different in nature from ordinary negligence.

The court will assert that the differences between negligence and gross negligence are in degree and character and not in kind, relying on the description of gross negligence as "an entire want of care" reflecting "conscious indifference." Since gross negligence is an aggravated form of negligence, the comparative negligence statute remains pertinent regardless of this aggravated character. The court will also hold that, even assuming the comparative negligence statute was inapplicable, a system of pure comparative causation would yield the same result for appellants' recovery due to principles established in Duncan—which directs that compensation be apportioned among all parties responsible for the injury.

Therefore, the appellate court will reject the appellants' arguments, affirm the judgment of the trial court, and conclude that the comparative negligence statute was properly applied to reduce the appellant survivors' award according to the appellee's percentage of fault. The appellee will not be held liable for damages beyond the 5% fault attributed to them by the jury's findings.
