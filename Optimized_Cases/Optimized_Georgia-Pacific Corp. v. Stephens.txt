Background:
The case involves an appellant manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, seeking a review of a judgment awarded to the appellees, a painter, Fred Stephens, and his wife. The case originated in the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County, Texas, where damages were awarded to the Stephens due to the painter's asbestos injury – specifically, mesothelioma. 

Fred Stephens worked in occupations highly exposed to asbestos and asbestos-containing materials for over thirty years. He served in the Navy, worked on the Grand Coulee Dam, and later became a commercial painter, which further exposed him to various asbestos-related products.

The complaint alleged that Fred developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing joint compound products. According to testimony from the painter, his coworkers, and experts, Fred was exposed to multiple products that contained asbestos, and it was suggested that every exposure to such products could be a contributing factor to causing mesothelioma. No scientific evidence, however, was presented to establish a minimum exposure level to asbestos-containing joint compound that would lead to an increased risk of mesothelioma.

Georgia-Pacific Corporation argued that the evidence was legally insufficient because the Stephenses could not prove which specific asbestos product caused Fred's disease nor prove significant exposure to Georgia-Pacific's product specifically. Additional contentions included an error in excluding Fred's affidavit concerning exposure to asbestos gloves manufactured by Guard-Line, insufficiency of evidence to support mental anguish damages, and insufficient evidence to support a jury finding of malice. 

Throughout the case, the concept of specific causation became central, with varying views on the standards required to prove it. Prior cases provided different tests for determining specific causation, leading to uncertainty about the necessary level of exposure to establish liability. Fred Stephens and several coworkers had observed multiple asbestos-containing products at job sites, including Georgia-Pacific's joint compound, among other brands.

Procedural History:
The Stephenses originally sued multiple defendants but by the time of trial had settled all claims except against three defendants including Georgia-Pacific. The case was removed to federal court but then remanded back to state court. At trial, the experts’ testimony asserted that Fred’s asbestos exposure was at levels known to contribute to the development of asbestos-related diseases. The jury found for the Stephenses, but Georgia-Pacific contested the verdict.

Verdict:
The court will reverse and render judgment for the manufacturer, Georgia-Pacific, due to the legal insufficiency of evidence to support the causation finding. The reversal will be based on the application of the Texas Supreme Court's decision in Borg-Warner Corporation v. Flores, asserting that the testimony from the Stephenses’ experts does not satisfy the legal requirements for establishing specific causation. 

The reasoning for this verdict will contend that although the testimony established general exposure to asbestos-containing products, it failed to specifically pinpoint Georgia-Pacific’s joint compound as the substantial factor in causing the mesothelioma. Quantitative evidence about the frequency, regularity, and proximity of Fred's exposure to Georgia-Pacific’s specific product was lacking, which made it impossible to establish that exposure to this product significantly increased Fred's risk of developing mesothelioma.

Furthermore, there will be a requirement for reasonable quantitative evidence correlating the risk of exposure to the product with the development of the illness - a condition not met in this case. Additionally, the 'any exposure' theory will be deemed inadequate for lacking scientific consensus and not aligning with dose-response principles essential in toxic tort cases. Taking into account the epidemiological requirement set forth by the Texas Supreme Court, the verdict will rule out evidence of an 'any exposure' basis as insufficient for proving that Fred's exposure to Georgia-Pacific's joint compound was a substantial factor resulting in his mesothelioma. Thus, the Stephenses will not have met their burden of providing credible scientific evidence of specific causation under the refined standards demanded by recent legal precedents.
