Background:

Patsy Snodgrass underwent a heart bypass surgery on February 20, 2009, at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center. Post-operatively, she was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit, where she received care from nurses and respiratory therapists. However, she did not regain consciousness post-surgery. On February 21, during visitation, it was observed by her family and the nurses that the bed she was in did not maintain the intended elevation of about thirty degrees; instead, it spontaneously and gradually lowered itself. Mrs. Snodgrass was then moved to another bed. A February 23 MRI revealed significant brain damage, and she never regained consciousness, eventually passing away on March 4, 2009.

The plaintiffs filed a health care liability action on June 14, 2010, against Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center and its employees, as well as Hill-Rom Company, Inc., the manufacturer of the bed. They alleged that the spontaneous lowering of the bed's head most likely caused displacement of the oxygen-supplying endotracheal tube, resulting in a loss of oxygen and consequent brain damage. The plaintiffs claimed negligence by Hillcrest's staff in responding to the situation and also held Hill-Rom liable under theories of products liability and negligence.

The plaintiffs had until May 6, 2011, to file their designations of expert witnesses, which they did not meet. Hillcrest and Hill-Rom filed no-evidence motions for summary judgment on June 24 and June 30, 2011, respectively, asserting that the plaintiffs had no evidence of causation, which is a key element in health care liability claims. The trial court granted the motions after a July 26, 2011, hearing and signed a final judgment on August 19. This appeal followed.

Verdict:

In addressing the appeal, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed. In the causation element of a health care liability claim, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of the injury. In this case, the plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that met the legal requirement of establishing causation through qualified expert testimony. The affidavits of nurses Davis and Guercia, provided by plaintiffs, did not qualify as evidence of causation as neither were legally qualified to render an opinion on causation in a health care liability claim. Furthermore, their opinions were deemed speculative and not based on reasonable medical probability, which is necessary for establishing causation. Dr. Webb's letter also failed to provide any evidence regarding causation as he did not opine on the proximate cause of Mrs. Snodgrass's brain injury.

Regarding the discovery period, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering Hillcrest's no-evidence motion despite claims by the plaintiffs that they hadn't had adequate time for discovery. The expert designation deadline had passed without the plaintiffs designating a qualified expert on causation, which was essential for their health care liability claim. Therefore, neither the pending depositions nor the inspection of the bed by the "bed expert" would have remedied the absence of causation evidence.

As for the assertion that the court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Hill-Rom since the claim against it was of products liability and not health care liability, this argument by the plaintiffs was inadequately briefed and therefore considered waived. Even if it were properly before the court, the absence of evidence of causation still persists.

Finally, the plaintiffs' proposed application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not stand as it does not relieve the claimant of the need to prove causation, which was not established in this case. Therefore, reliance on this doctrine does not affect the absence of causation evidence.

In conclusion, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed as the plaintiffs have overruled each of their issues on appeal due to the failure to present evidence of causation and properly adhere to discovery schedules and expert designations.
