Background:
James Bailey, a deceased employee, was exposed to asbestos while working at Mobil's Beaumont, Texas, facilities intermittently between 1966 and 1972. His family and the administratrix of his estate brought a wrongful death action against Mobil, alleging that his lung cancer was caused by asbestos exposure on the employer's premises. The jury found in favor of the Bailey family, awarding $350,000 in actual damages and $500,000 in exemplary damages due to malice. Mobil challenged the verdict, claiming there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of causation, arguing that Bailey's heavy smoking history was the true cause of his lung cancer.

James Bailey had a long history of smoking, consuming a pack of cigarettes per day for the last forty to fifty years of his life. There was no medical evidence indicating typical signs of asbestos exposure, such as asbestos bodies in his lungs or scarring of lung tissues. During the trial, the central issue was the medical causation of Bailey's lung cancer, and whether it was caused by asbestos exposure at Mobil's facilities or by Bailey's history of heavy smoking. The Bailey family presented two medical causation experts, Dr. Gary Friedman and Dr. Richard Lemen, who testified about the increased risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure and its synergistic effect with smoking. The family's theory was based on the severe asbestos exposure at Mobil, whereas Mobil's theory pointed solely to Bailey's heavy smoking.

Mobil's appeal raised issues concerning the admissibility of the plaintiff expert's testimony on medical causation and the lack of "legally sufficient evidence" to support the jury's finding. The appeal considered the standards set forth in prior cases such as E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. Robinson, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, and City of Keller v. Wilson in determining the admissibility of scientific expert testimony. The reliability of scientific evidence in toxic tort cases was also a key consideration, as outlined in the Havner decision, particularly around epidemiological studies used to prove causation.

Verdict:
The appellate court will likely find the judgment in favor of the Baileys legally insufficient due to the unreliability of the expert testimony provided. Under the precedents set by previous Texas Supreme Court decisions, the court will require that the scientific evidence presented had a reliable foundation and was relevant to the case. The court will look for scientifically reliable evidence that specifically attributes the cause of the lung cancer to asbestos exposure, which must be more than speculation or subjective belief.

The causation experts for the Baileys are expected to fail in meeting these requirements because their testimony did not sufficiently negate the plausible alternate cause of Baileyâ€™s lung cancer: his heavy smoking history. Moreover, the Baileys' experts will be discredited for relying on medical literature and studies that have not achieved general acceptance within the scientific community and lacked the necessary detailed methodology and validation.

Despite the findings that asbestos can cause lung cancer and the typically higher risk in smokers also exposed to asbestos, the lack of direct signs of asbestos-related lung damage in Bailey, as well as the conflicting epidemiological evidence presented, will result in the conclusion that the Baileys have failed to exclude other plausible causes "with reasonable certainty." Therefore, the verdict will be reversed, and judgment rendered in favor of Mobil Oil Corporation, with the appellate court finding no legally sufficient evidence of medical causation to support the jury's original verdict.
