Background:
Melvin James Farmer, the appellant, initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Fred DeFrancesco, the appellee, after suffering injuries ostensibly due to medical treatment and care provided by Dr. DeFrancesco following an on-the-job accident where a piece of concrete fell on Farmer's left lower leg. The treatment included surgery and post-operative procedures. However, Farmer's wound became infected with various bacteria, leading to multiple hospitalizations, additional surgeries, and ultimately, the amputation of his leg.

Farmer consulted with Dr. DeFrancesco several times between February and July 1985, during which he underwent various treatments and procedures, such as an open reduction and internal fixation of the leg, antibiotic treatments, and skin graft surgery by another surgeon, Dr. Montoya. Despite these procedures and follow-ups, the infections persisted, leading to more drastic measures such as consulting with an infectious disease specialist and transferring Farmer for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which also failed, resulting in the amputation.

Dr. DeFrancesco filed for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. Farmer challenged the summary judgment, asserting that there was insufficient evidence to support it and claiming procedural errors, including the trial court's failure to provide him with an opportunity to depose an expert witness, Dr. William Mogabgab. Farmer also objected to the contents and consideration of affidavits by Dr. DeFrancesco's experts and argued that the trial court erred by requiring him to prove a prima facie case during the summary judgment hearing.

Two key affidavits were central to the trial court’s decision. The affidavit from Dr. Carl Vartian supported Dr. DeFrancesco's case by detailing the care provided, affirming that the standard of care was met, and stating that no act or omission of Dr. DeFrancesco was a cause of the loss of Farmer’s leg. Conversely, Farmer’s expert, Dr. Mogabgab's affidavit, failed to establish the expert's qualifications or articulate a standard of care, a breach of that standard, or a causal connection to Farmer's injuries.

The court’s review adhered to the standards outlined by the Texas Supreme Court for summary judgments. This included taking evidence in favor of the non-movant as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor unless the movant’s evidence is uncontroverted.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Dr. DeFrancesco because Farmer, the appellant, did not produce controverting evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on the elements of negligence and proximate cause, which Dr. DeFrancesco's evidence conclusively negated. The court will reason that Dr. Vartian's affidavit effectively negated the elements of breach of standard of care and the causal connection with harm suffered. Since Dr. DeFrancesco met his burden of showing an absence of a material fact issue, the burden shifted to Farmer to present evidence that there was indeed a genuine issue for trial.

Farmer’s reliance on Dr. Mogabgab's affidavit will be determined insufficient because it lacked statements on the relevant standard of care, how Dr. DeFrancesco’s actions may have been below that standard, or how those actions caused Farmer's injury. Because these are necessary components in a medical malpractice claim, and Farmer's evidence failed to address them, the court will find that there is no controverting evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact for trial concerning negligence and proximate cause.

The court will also find no abuse of discretion by the trial court for denying Farmer additional time to depose Dr. Mogabgab, as sufficient time was provided. Furthermore, the court will determine that procedural objections regarding Dr. Vartian's affidavit, such as the attachment of medical records and questioning of his expertise, were not preserved for appeal due to Farmer's failure to challenge these at the trial level.

The court will also overlook Farmer's procedural objections on the grounds that he did not adequately argue or provide authority for his points, effectively waiving these issues.

In summary, the decision to affirm the judgment will be based on procedural groundings and the substantive failure of Farmer’s evidence to raise genuine issues of material fact concerning the allegations of medical malpractice against Dr. DeFrancesco.
