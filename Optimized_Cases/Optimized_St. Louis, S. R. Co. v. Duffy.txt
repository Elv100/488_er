Background:
The personal injury action in question arises from an accident that occurred on the night of February 16, 1955, involving a car hitting a train during a switching procedure. David Duffy, an 18-year-old high school senior, was a passenger in a 1941 Chevrolet automobile driven by Irving A. Hoff when the vehicle collided with a train operated by the defendant Railroad at a crossing in north Dallas County. The train was blocking the crossing, with part of it sitting directly on the crossing, and the remainder, including a caboose, extending south of the crossing. There were no lights or signals to indicate the blocked crossing, the portion of the train on the crossing was unlit, and the accident happened after dark on a moonless night. The track ran north-south, and the crossing was at grade with Belt Line Road.

The jury answered several questions concerning the circumstances of the accident, finding that the railroad crossing was more than ordinarily dangerous during nighttime switching operations, and that the railroad should have known this. They found the railroadâ€™s failure to have a signal device or a flagman or to provide flares a proximate cause of the collision, while also finding that Hoff's manner of driving, including excessive speed and failure to keep a proper lookout, was negligent but not the sole cause of the accident. Plaintiff David Duffy was found not negligent.

The jury awarded damages to David Duffy for physical pain, mental suffering, loss of capacity to work, and earn money in the amount of $50,000. They also awarded Martin Duffy, David's father, $1,500 for medical expenses incurred. The railroad was aware of both the permanent and temporary conditions at the crossing and the high volume of traffic that passed through the area, as evidenced by prior traffic counts and a request from the county for the installation of signal lights at the crossing.

The Railroad's contention during the trial was that the crossing, being at a right angle with no curves or angles, would not be considered extra-hazardous, and any collision would result from the driver's negligence or a passenger's failure to warn. However, evidence from several witnesses, including past near-accidents and the lack of visibility of the train at night, supported the description of the crossing as extra-hazardous. The crossing was reportedly blocked frequently for switching operations, and this particular night the road would have been cleared in "three or four minutes."

The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs (Duffy), but the Railroad appealed, and the court reversed the decision. The Duffy plaintiffs then filed a motion for rehearing.

Verdict:
The motion for rehearing is going to be vacated because there is sufficient evidence that the crossing where the accident occurred was more than ordinarily dangerous at the time of night when switching operations were performed. This presents a fact issue that should be left to the jury to decide.

The court on rehearing will find that the Railroad had constructive knowledge of the dangerous conditions at the crossing due to the regularity of trains blocking the road for switching operations at night and the Railroad receiving a letter from the County Traffic Engineer expressing concerns about the crossing. The Railroad's failure to take action despite this knowledge supports a negligence finding.

In reaching a decision, the court will observe that the volume of roadway traffic is a significant factor in the character and risk assessment of a railroad crossing, as demonstrated by the daily traffic counts presented in evidence. Additionally, the lack of moonlight on the night of the accident contributed to the crossing's hazardous status, compounded by the dark-colored boxcars that were not reflective, causing approaching headlights to shine under the train instead of illuminating it.

The switching operations at this crossing differed from typical railroad crossings because the train was frequently stopped at the crossing for the interchange of cars. Coupled with the testimony of the train crew and a history of incidents, these distinguishing elements indicated an extra-hazardous condition. Observations from residents who had experienced near-collisions due to poor visibility of the train at night further substantiated the jury's findings.

The damage award for David Duffy will be upheld as reasonable and not excessive given the severe and permanent injuries he sustained, which were duly considered by the jury. The court will also conclude that there was no evidence of jury misconduct affecting the verdict.

For these reasons, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment for the plaintiffs, upholding the jury's determination of the Railroad's negligence and the award of the damages to David Duffy and Martin Duffy. The Railroad's contention that they were due a peremptory instruction will be dismissed, as the evidence supports the jury's finding of extra-hazardous conditions and the Railroad's failure to adequately signal the crossing. The Railroad's failure to investigate conditions at the crossing after being notified of traffic concerns will also weigh heavily against them. 

The trial court's original judgment in favor of the father and son plaintiffs will stand, confirming the Railroad's knowledge of the dangerous crossing conditions and its negligence in failing to provide adequate warnings for motorists.
