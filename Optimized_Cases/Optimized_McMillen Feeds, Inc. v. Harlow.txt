Background:
A products liability case was brought to court involving plaintiff turkey grower and defendant feed supplier. The defendant sold and delivered turkey feed under the brand "Master Mix" to the plaintiff, with the expectation that the feed would be used to feed approximately 250,000 turkeys during the year 1963. The grower added nothing to the feed except for mixing it with milo according to the defendant's specific instructions. The defendant financed all turkey feed, poults, and medication and supported the feeding process with expert visits and inspections. 

After the feed was distributed to various locations over central Texas, the plaintiff's turkeys, which were consuming the Master Mix feed, began to exhibit signs of illness, such as loss of color, becoming "droopy," and when dressed, emitting an unusual sour odor. These symptoms appeared simultaneously across diverse geographic areas among flocks that had only the feeding of Master Mix in common. The plaintiff sought the expertise of several professionals, who did not find disease to be the cause but recommended changing the feed. An experiment was conducted, where one group of turkeys was fed a competitive company's feed and displayed rapid improvement over the group that continued on Master Mix. The defendant's representative had expressed concerns about the performance of the turkeys. 

Numerous experts, both for the plaintiff and defendant, gave testimony regarding the turkeys' health, with diagnoses ranging from mycosis and bacterial infection to copper poisoning from Ema-sol, a product used in their water. Through these deliberations, the jury found that the Master Mix feed, containing 8.5% to 20% cottonseed meal, was harmful to the turkeys and it was the producing cause of the damages sustained. The defendant appealed, citing various points of error, including contractual disclaimers of warranty and effectiveness, and strict liability considerations.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff, concluding that the evidence provided, both direct and circumstantial, was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that the harm to the turkeys was a direct result of the cottonseed meal content in the Master Mix feed supplied by the defendant. The court upheld the rule of strict liability imposed on vendors of food products and dismissed the effectiveness of disclaimers on feed contracts that attempted to waive or limit liability. These contractual terms do not mitigate the vendorâ€™s strict liability in the event harm is caused by the product unfit for its intended purpose. 

Furthermore, the court determined that the disclaimer on the back of the contract was ineffective. Citing the case of Vandermark v. Ford Motor Company and Linn v. Radio Center Delicatessen, the court maintained that waivers that deviate from public policy by releasing manufacturers from strict liability for delivering unwholesome food products are invalid. Additionally, the sale of unfit feed also violated Texas Commercial Feed Control Act of 1957, which set standards for feed production, and any anticipatory release or waiver for violations of such a penal statute is universally held to be void. 

Based on the detail and correlation of the evidence across numerous witnesses and expert testimonies, the jury's findings concerning the specific damages and causes were upheld as they were not against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Damages were calculated in detail and supported by the plaintiff's profit and loss statements, bank statements, industry growth charts, and other documents, which indicated the financial significance of the turkeys' weight loss and failed growth. Interest was awarded from January 15, 1964, which aligns with the rationale of providing complete indemnity for the injured party, and the jury's verdict was not deemed excessive given the detailed nature of the evidence provided for each component of the damage award.

The judgment against the defendant feed supplier was a product of thorough and corroborated evidence that pointed to the feed's harmful cottonseed meal content as the primary cause of the plaintiff turkey grower's damages, affirming the rule of strict liability.
