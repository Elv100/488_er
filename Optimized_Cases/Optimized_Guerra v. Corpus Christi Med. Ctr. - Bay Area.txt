**Background:**  
The case revolves around a medical malpractice claim involving the death of Harold Guerra, following a cervical fusion surgery performed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr. John Halcomb on January 27, 2003. Post-surgery, Guerra was under the care of Nurse Melinda Quinonez LVN. Guerra's wife, Miguela "Mickie," reported to the nursing staff that her husband felt anxious and was having breathing difficulties around 2:30 p.m., shortly after being moved to his hospital room. Contrasting testimonies emerged about the timing of the complaints, with Nurse Quinonez testifying that shortness of breath was not reported by Guerra or his family until 3:25 p.m. The patient continued to experience difficulties, and at 3:45 p.m., a respiratory code was called. Despite attempts by medical staff to intubate Guerra and an emergency tracheostomy performed around 4:05 p.m., he was deprived of oxygen for too long and succumbed to brain death, passing away eleven days later. A jury awarded the plaintiffs, Guerra's survivors, approximately $2.2 million, but the trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of the defendants, the hospital and nurse employees, based on the claimed insufficiency of evidence to support the jury's verdict regarding causation. The plaintiffs appealed this decision.

The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rested on expert testimony, particularly from Dr. David J. Cullen, who asserted that Guerra would not have died if Dr. Halcomb had been notified of the patient's complications at 2:30 p.m., or even as late as 2:45 p.m. Other medical experts and nurses involved corroborated the view that an earlier notification could have led to lifesaving interventions. The defendants argued that insufficient evidence was presented to establish a causal link between the hospital's actions and Guerra's death, emphasizing that none of the medical staff were able to explain why intubation attempts failed. They compared the case to Jea v. Cho, where the court rejected a series of "ifs" as evidence.

**Verdict:**  
The reviewing court will reverse the JNOV granted by the trial court and remand the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. The reasoning will be based on the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding causation, which allows a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that the hospital's negligence proximately caused Guerra's death. The court will credit Dr. Cullen's expert testimony that establishes a reasonable medical probability that an earlier call to Dr. Halcomb would have provided enough time for a successful intervention, and the hospital's failure to make the call was a substantial factor in bringing about the fatal outcome. The court will consider that the jury is entitled to believe Mickie's report over Nurse Quinonez's conflicting account and that jurors may choose to believe one witness over another. Furthermore, the hospital's foreseeability argument will be addressed, with Nurse Quinonez's testimony inferring that Guerra's death was a foreseeable consequence of not addressing his breathing difficulties sooner. The court will distinguish the present case from Jea v. Cho, noting that in the Guerra case, there was expert testimony specifically articulating a reasonable probability of causation. The hospital's analogy to Cho will fail as the court will not accept the argument that expert opinions regarding causation merely constitute a series of speculative "ifs." Instead, the court will find Dr. Cullen's testimony sufficient to support the jury's finding. This detailed analysis of the testimonies and evidence in favor of causation will lead to the conclusion that the evidence meets the standard required for legal sufficiency, necessitating the reversal of the JNOV and upholding the initial jury award.
