Background:
In 2013, Bryan Stallworth was charged with assault on a family member, second offense, by impeding breathing. Randall Ayers was appointed by the criminal court to represent Stallworth, who was ultimately convicted. In September 2015, Stallworth, acting pro se, filed a civil lawsuit against Ayers alleging negligence in his representation during the criminal proceedings. He claimed that he provided Ayers with an affidavit from the complainant recanting her allegations, which Ayers failed to present to the court. Additionally, Stallworth alleged Ayers neglected to confront the state with an inadequate complaint under the Code of Criminal Procedure article 15.05(2).

Stallworth asserted that his incarceration was solely due to Ayers' negligence and not his own criminal conduct. He amended his petition to include breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, and violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). Stallworth never claimed he was exonerated from the assault offense by direct appeal, habeas corpus, or other methods. Ayers filed a motion to dismiss under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a, contending that as Stallworth was not exonerated, his conviction resulted from his own conduct, not any negligence by Ayers, therefore lacking causation in law for the alleged malpractice.

Verdict:
Upon reviewing the case, it is predicted that the trial court's dismissal of Stallworth's lawsuit will be upheld. The reasoning will largely rest on the application of the decision in Peeler v. Hughes & Luce, where the Texas Supreme Court established that legal malpractice claims against criminal attorneys are barred unless the plaintiff has been exonerated. The court will find that Stallworthâ€™s various claims, despite being labeled as breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, all fundamentally allege inadequate legal representation, and thus, fall under the category of legal malpractice claims. Since Stallworth did not allege exoneration, the court will determine that his criminal conduct is the legal cause of the conviction, and Ayers' conduct, even if proved negligent, would not be considered the proximate cause of the conviction.

Furthermore, the court will not accept the documents Stallworth presented (such as the complainant's affidavit or a fax cover letter to the court) as "official government documents" sufficient to overcome the Peeler bar since they were not generated by the government or judicial authority and did not demonstrate formal exoneration. The trial court will be seen to have properly applied Rule 91a, and Stallworth's claims will be considered as having no basis in law because they fail to meet the causation requirement for malpractice claims due to the absence of criminal exoneration. Consequently, not only will the dismissal of Stallworth's claims be affirmed, but Ayers will also be awarded attorney's fees.
