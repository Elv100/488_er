{Background: The case involves an appeal from the appellant employer, Heard & Heard, Inc., against a judgment in favor of the appellee car passenger, Louise Kuhnert, for a personal injury action subsequent to a vehicular collision. The collision occurred at night in Bee County, Texas, and involved a truck and trailer owned by the employer, driven by its employee, Charlie Bishop, who was acting within the scope of his employment; and a Chevrolet coupe operated by George Thomasson, with Tom Campbell and Miss Kuhnert riding as passengers. The incident resulted in fatalities (Thomasson and Campbell) and serious injuries to Miss Kuhnert.

Evidence for the case showed that at the time of the collision, the truck driver was partially on the wrong side of the highway, and the jury found this to constitute negligence and a proximate cause of the appellee's injuries. The appellant employer contested the verdict, claiming that the car's driver may have been the sole proximate cause of the collision and the related injuries, which the trial court refused to submit to the jury. The appellant also requested the submission of an "unavoidable accident" issue, which was similarly denied.

The case revolved around whether venue could be maintained in Bee County based on the allegations of trespass and crime, with Heard & Heard, Inc. having filed a statutory plea of privilege to contest venue, relying on exceptions in the Texas Civil Statutes; specifically, those concerning crimes, offenses, or trespasses and the ability to bring suits against corporations where the cause of action arose.

The central legal question hinged on the concept of "proximate cause" as an element of a venue fact, the court's responsibility to submit issues raised by the evidence to the jury, and whether the trial court correctly refused to submit the issue of "sole proximate cause" given the contentions by the employer.

Verdict: In determining the verdict, the reasoning should most likely focus on legal and evidentiary analysis within the context of venue and proximate cause. Assuming the detailed facts in the background, the Supreme Court will probably acknowledge that proximate cause, as an element of venue fact under the exceptions in Article 1995 used to establish venue over the appellant's plea of privilege, must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. If the evidence sufficiently indicated that an act by Thomasson, the driver of the car, could have been the sole proximate cause of the collision, the trial court should have submitted this issue to the jury. The trial court's refusal to do so could lead to a conclusion that it erred in this aspect, especially if there were evidence supporting this theory.

The verdict in this instance will likely reason that the right to challenge the element of proximate cause is integral to the appellant's defense, and its exclusion may have compromised the integrity of the judicial process by not allowing the jury to consider all theories substantiated by evidence. The verdict would potentially reverse the trial court's judgment based on the reasoning that all elements of a venue fact, such as the relationship between the alleged negligent act (proximate cause) and the injury, should be subject to jury consideration, and the appellant should have the opportunity to present its theory and disputations.

Additionally, since "proximate cause" is equally essential in this case for determining both venue and liability, resolving this element in a way that adheres to the standard rules (i.e., placing the burden of proof on the plaintiff and allowing the defendant to contradict plaintiff's evidence) would lead to the contention that core procedural fairness was breached by the trial court's rejection of relevant issue submissions by the appellant. Therefore, the verdict would reverse the judgment and remand the case to address these matters appropriately in line with legal standards. 

This means the original ruling in favor of the passenger, Kuhnert, will likely be set aside, and the case will be sent back to a lower court for a new trial, where the contested issues regarding proximate cause and resultant liabilities should be appropriately submitted to and deliberated by a jury. The court may also possibly provide guidance regarding the necessity for correct pleadings and issue submissions based on venue-related elements for civil actions in the context of personal injury and vehicle accidents.
