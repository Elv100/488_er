Background: Dennis Rayner, a long-haul truck driver with over thirty years of experience, was employed by Joe Tex Xpress, Inc. (Joe Tex). On July 23, 2010, Rayner was involved in a collision with Krista Dillon's Chevy Malibu while driving on Interstate Highway 30. Rayner changed lanes and struck Dillon's car from the rear, causing it to spin into the median. Dillon refused medical care at the scene but subsequently sought treatment for injuries and underwent surgeries. Dillon sued Rayner and his employer, Joe Tex, for personal injuries, eventually being awarded more than $1 million in actual damages and exemplary damages against Rayner and Joe Tex.

Evidence showed that Rayner had a history of falsifying his driver's log books, failing to submit required logs, and had driving schedule irregularities leading to questions about driver fatigue on the day of the incident. Rayner had previously been cited for nine DOT (Department of Transportation) violations for excessive driving hours and failed to submit thirteen driving logs in the month before the accident. There was also evidence of log-book violations on the date of the accident.

There had been a DOT audit of Joe Tex in April 2010, which resulted in lowering their safety rating due to safety-related violations, many of which were critical. Joe Tex's president, Joe Setina, admitted to being aware of Rayner’s log book falsifications before the accident and recognized that over-hour driving could result in driver fatigue, potentially leading to catastrophic accidents. Despite Joe Tex's policy stating that a driver's employment would be terminated after a fourth log book violation within thirty days, Rayner kept his job without any disciplinary action taken against him.

The gross negligence finding revolved around whether Rayner and Joe Tex were aware of the risks of driver fatigue and proceeded with conscious indifference to the safety of others, thus constituting gross negligence under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 41.001(11)(A), (B).

Verdict: The evidence supported the jury's finding of gross negligence against Rayner as he could not assert he was not fatigued on the day of the accident, did not see Dillon's car before the accident, hit her car from behind, and had a pattern of log book violations indicating driving excessive hours, reflecting a conscious indifference to the risks associated with driving while potentially fatigued given his extensive driving experience.

Similarly, the evidence substantiated the jury's finding of gross negligence against Joe Tex. Setina was acutely aware of Rayner’s long history of over-hour violations, which he acknowledged made a driver unsafe, well before the accident occurred. No adverse action was taken against Rayner, even though company policy required termination after multiple violations. Overall, Joe Tex's lax approach, despite awareness of the dangerous pattern, indicated that the company knowingly allowed Rayner to drive potentially fatigued, maintaining a practice that disregarded the safety of other motorists.

Therefore, both the objective and subjective components of gross negligence defined by statute were met by clear and convincing evidence. The jury could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction that both Rayner and Joe Tex's conduct was grossly negligent, which led to the harm experienced by Dillon. As such, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of Dillon against Rayner and Joe Tex.
