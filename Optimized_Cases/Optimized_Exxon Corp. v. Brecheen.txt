Background:
On March 10, 1970, William D. Brecheen Jr., a tank truck driver for Oil Transport Company, suffered injuries after being sprayed in the face with oil at Exxon's Baytown Refinery. Following the incident, he developed medical and psychological issues that had no previous history before the accident. He consulted with Dr. Larry B. Summers and Dr. James Peden, both of whom diagnosed him with severe mental illnesses like psychosis and schizophrenia deemed to be caused by the oil spraying incident.

Brecheen's condition led to erratic and unnatural behavior. Despite various treatments, there was no improvement in his mental health. On December 19, 1972, Brecheen committed suicide, leaving behind a coherent note for his wife, Sue Brecheen. After his death, Sue Brecheen filed a lawsuit under the Survival Statute, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 5525, and the Wrongful Death Act, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 4671, et seq.

The jury found Exxon guilty of negligence, which proximately caused both the oil spray incident and Brecheen's resultant mental illness and his death. The trial court awarded Sue Brecheen compensatory damages for hospital, medical, funeral charges, loss under Article 5525, compensation under Article 4671, and subrogation claims for Workmen's Compensation by Transport Insurance Company.

During the trial, the court excluded evidence of Sue Brecheen's ceremonial remarriage, a decision challenged by Exxon. Exxon presented three groups of points on appeal, including the exclusion of evidence regarding Brecheen's ceremonial remarriage and a release document signed by Brecheen upon entry to the refinery that purportedly released Exxon from liability.

Verdict:
The Court of Civil Appeals, and ultimately the Texas Supreme Court, reversed the trial court's judgment due to the exclusion of evidence of the ceremonial remarriage being deemed reversible error. The admissibility of evidence regarding Sue Brecheen's remarriage after her husband's death was mandated by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4675a, which became effective after Brecheen's death but before the trial.

The reversal is premised on the principle that the legislature's explicit instruction that evidence of a surviving spouse's ceremonial remarriage is admissible in wrongful death actions cannot be disregarded by the court. The court found that adjudicating the harmlessness of excluding such evidence would render the statute ineffectual, which would be contrary to the legislative intent and judicial duty to apply the law as declared by the legislature.

The Court also addressed Exxon's suicide defense argument, which contended that the suicide could not reasonably be anticipated as a result of the oil spray incident and that Brecheen may have committed suicide during a lucid interval. However, the court adopted the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS ยง 455, recognizing that a negligent act leading to insanity could render the actor liable for resulting self-harm during an uncontrollable impulse caused by that insanity. Nevertheless, the primary reason for reversal was the procedural error in excluding remarriage evidence, not the jury's findings on causation and negligence. The case was remanded for a new trial, allowing the evidence of Sue Brecheen's remarriage to be admitted.
