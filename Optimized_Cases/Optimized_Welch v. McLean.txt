Background: The heirs of a deceased patient, Delores McLean, brought a medical malpractice action against Dr. Robert Morrow Welch after Delores died from a massive pulmonary embolus. On April 24, 1996, Delores presented to the emergency room, complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain. Dr. Welch diagnosed Delores as suffering from sinusitis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypoxemia, but failed to diagnose pulmonary emboli. Over the next few months, Delores sought medical help several times, but not until July 8, 1996, did any indication of a problem other than pneumonia arise. She collapsed at home on July 9 and was pronounced dead shortly after midnight on July 10, 1996. Autopsy results revealed that the cause of Delores's death was a massive saddle embolus and showcased evidence of a left deep leg vein thrombosis. Microscopic examination of her lungs showed emboli that were present four to six weeks before her death, suggesting they were present during her visit to the ER on April 24, 1996. Based on this evidence and the omission of the full diagnosis, the jury found that Dr. Welch’s negligence had proximately caused Delores's death and awarded significant damages to the heirs.

Verdict: The appellate court will reverse the trial court's judgment that awarded the heirs the entire damages amount and will render a judgment that awards damages based on the cap. The reasoning will be that the Texas Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act’s noneconomic damages cap does apply to the jury's damages award, restricting the maximum amount the heirs can recover from Dr. Welch to the specified cap as adjusted by the consumer price index. This cap is in place regardless of the Stowers doctrine, which applies only to insurers, not to physicians or healthcare providers themselves. Therefore, the expert testimony by Simeon’s experts in conjunction with the autopsy findings will be deemed legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Delores was suffering from pulmonary emboli when Dr. Welch treated her on April 24, 1996. However, the trial court’s refusal to apply the damages cap to the jury's damages award and prejudgment interest was erroneous. The appellate court will conclude that former article 4590i, section 11.02(c) of the 1977 Texas General Laws, which does not lift the cap applicable to physicians, controls the outcome, as it only addresses the insurer's Stowers liability to the insured physician and does not affect the damages cap. The verdict will also maintain that prejudgment interest on noneconomic damages is subject to the damages cap and that a settlement credit is deducted from the total amount of damages to be recovered in the entire cause of action, not just the damages recoverable against a single codefendant. Thus, the trial court did not err in how it applied the settlement credit to the damages award. The heirs will be awarded specific amounts to Simeon individually and as heir to Delores McLean's estate, as well as next friend of Jamila Imari McLean and Imani Zakiya McLean, without any prejudgment interest, but with entitlement to postjudgment interest, court costs, and ad litem fees.
