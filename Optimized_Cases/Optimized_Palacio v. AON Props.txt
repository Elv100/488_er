Background:
James Palacio, also known by the nickname "Larry," was a victim of a shooting incident inside the Riveraine Apartments property where he was staying in an apartment with Margarita Morin-Gonzales's brother, Ruben Morin, and her two sons. The incident occurred around 1 a.m. while Morin-Gonzales was incarcerated. Ruben Morin answered a knock at the door to find a man asking for "Larry" to sell him a ring. After informing Palacio of the visitor, Morin left the door ajar, and when Palacio conversed with the visitor, a second man shot him. Palacio sustained severe injuries from the gunshot.

Palacio filed a lawsuit against the apartment owner, AON Properties; the management company, Greystar Management Services; and the security provider, Weiser Security Services, asserting allegations of negligence and gross negligence and seeking damages. His case contended that the defendants collectively failed to provide a safe environment, contributing to his injuries. The defendants joined "John Does 1-4" as responsible third parties. The trial court later granted summary judgment motions in favor of AON, Greystar, and Weiser, leading to Palacio's appeal. Central to the dispute before the appellate court was the issue of proximate cause and whether the deliberate nature of the third-party criminal act could be a superseding cause of the injury, negating the proximity of any alleged negligence on the defendants' part.

Verdict:
In the prediction of the verdict, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The defense will successfully argue that the specific, targeted nature of the criminal act which led to Palacio’s injuries constituted a superseding cause. This criminal act will be determined to be unforeseeable and extraordinary compared to the general kind of harm that might result from the defendants' negligence. The appellate court's reasoning will hinge on the principle that proximate cause consists of cause-in-fact and foreseeability, and that a superseding cause can negate the need to prove proximate cause when it concerns deliberate criminal conduct. 

Despite Palacio's judicial admission of the targeted, deliberate nature of the crime, even Morin's assertion of witnessing a single man at the door who later became an accomplice to a second, hidden assailant, will not suffice to establish liability on the part of AON, Greystar, or Weiser. The protective order and decisions regarding the identity and deposition of witnesses, including errors in preserving objections for appeal, will not play a significant role in the verdict. Palacio's inability to present evidence of any specific threat or reason the defendants could have anticipated the criminal act will lead to the upholding of the summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Moreover, the appellate court will determine that the defendants' actions or possible negligence did not create a situation that contributed to the execution of the crime, as the assailants' deliberate intent was independent of any security measures or lack thereof. The principles outlined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 442 will further support the court's analysis, reinforcing the view that the defendants could not have anticipated the highly targeted and individualized nature of this criminal act.
