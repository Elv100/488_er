Background:
A Texas widow, Mrs. Bessie McVeigh, filed a lawsuit against International Travelers Assurance Company seeking to recover benefits under an accidental death policy for her husband, Townsend A. McVeigh, who had passed away. According to the widow's account, her husband sustained serious injuries as a result of an accidental fall in the bathroom of his home on April 17, 1932, suffering injuries to his abdomen, organs within the abdominal cavity, and his spine. The injuries led to a ruptured appendix and subsequent peritonitis, causing his death on May 4, 1932. The insurance policy in question was against "loss resulting from bodily injuries effected directly, independently and exclusively, of all other causes through accidental means."

However, the insurance company opposed the claim, citing a peremptory instruction requested at the end of the widow's evidence. This was based on the discrepancy that the company named in the policy was different than the one the widow filed against. The trial court granted the company's motion and ordered that the widow take nothing. Additionally, the widow's evidence was challenged for failing to prove that the fall was the direct, independent, and exclusive cause of her husband's death. The trial court ruling emphasized the potential for a "fatal variance" between allegation and proof, mainly because the named entity in the policy, attached as an exhibit to the widow's petition, was the International Travelers Association, not the International Travelers Assurance Company.

During the trial, the widow and several witnesses testified about the circumstances of the fall, Mr. McVeigh's prior good health, and the immediate decline after his injuries. Medical experts provided differing views on whether the fall could have caused or aggravated the appendix condition leading to Mr. McVeigh's death. Opinions varied on whether pressure from the fall could cause such an injury, the possible existence of a chronic condition in the appendix prior to the fall, and the direct correlation between the fall and the ruptured appendix. The case was appealed, challenging the trial court's verdict.

Verdict:
Upon appeal, a justice held that the lower court erred in its ruling regarding the variance based on the name discrepancy between the insurance entities. The appellate court reasoned that the insurance company did not file a plea of non est factum, which would question the validity of the contract based on the naming issue. Furthermore, because the insurance company admitted its obligation to assume the contract in its pleas, it could not effectively contest the policy's validity. 

The court also found that Mr. McVeigh's health before the fall and the direct, severe impact following the fall raised a genuine issue for deliberation. This evidence supported that Mr. McVeigh was in reasonably good health prior to the incident, and his health significantly deteriorated post-injury. Legal principles favored interpreting the clause in a manner favorable to the insured unless the accident could be considered the proximate cause of death, irrespective of any existing disease. 

Further, the court held that a reviewing court must disregard any conflicts in the evidence and focus only on the evidence supporting the existence of the facts being contested in favor of the party whose evidence was being challenged. In this light, the experts' varied testimony still presented a sufficient basis that the accident may have been the direct and proximate cause of Mr. McVeigh's demise. 

Taken together, the court decided that the evidence presented a legally sufficient case to be adjudicated by a jury, rather than being dismissed through a directed verdict. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, effectively suggesting that a trial should be conducted where the jury would decide on the cause of Mr. McVeigh's death in relation to the accidental fall and its coverage under the accidental death policy. The insurance company's motion for rehearing was overruled, upholding the decision for a new trial.
