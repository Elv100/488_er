Background:
The background of the case involves an employee, hereinafter referred to as plaintiff, who suffered a hernia whilst working to remove a hand rail car from his employer's tracks along with his supervisor and another laborer. The plaintiff initiated a personal injury lawsuit against his employer, the appellant, arguing that the supervisor's negligence in dropping the car was the proximate cause of his injury. The plaintiff presented two grounds of negligence: 1) the negligence of the supervisor in improperly handling the hand car, and 2) the employer's failure to furnish an adequate number of men to safely carry out the task. 

At trial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $2,500 in damages. The appellant employer filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, leading to an appeal. During the appeal, the appellant contested the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury to return a verdict in its favor, among other things. The evidence presented in the trial showed detailed accounts of how the supervisor and the plaintiff attempted to move the hand car, the supervisor's sudden dropping of the car, and the immediate impact and pain experienced by the plaintiff. Additionally, testimony was given regarding the inadequate number of employees present to handle the car safely, and the supervisor's comments immediately following the incident that implied a recognition of inadequate staffing. The appellant attempted to argue that the plaintiff’s injury was the result of his physical condition and that he assumed the risks associated with the job, including the injury that occurred.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court will hold that the evidence sufficiently demonstrated the supervisor's negligence as the proximate cause of the plaintiff's hernia, thus upholding the jury's findings. The defense's first argument for a directed verdict will be rebuffed because the plaintiff's claims of negligence, particularly regarding the supervisor's actions, were supported by ample evidence that justified presenting the question to the jury.

The court will find that a peremptory instruction was not appropriate as the evidence was contested regarding the proximate cause of the injury and ordinary minds could infer that the injury was indeed due to the supervisor's actions rather than the inadequacy of the staff provided.
 
The court will also dismiss the appellant's contention that the plaintiff's pre-existing weak, sick, or diseased condition was the proximate cause of the injury. The court will establish that the plaintiff's physical condition did not contribute to the injury and that the evidence asserted this point clearly. 

Furthermore, the court will discount the appellant’s challenge to the introduction of testimony about the supervisor’s post-incident exclamation as it was relevant and qualified as part of the res gestae given its direct relation to the transaction. The court will suggest that any objection to the admission of this testimony should have been contemporaneously addressed at trial with a motion to strike or a directed request for the jury to disregard it, failure of which precludes the appellant from assigning reversible error on such basis at the appeal stage.

In conclusion, the court will uphold the trial verdict, finding no reversible errors in the record and substantiating the jury's determination of negligence on the supervisor's part as the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.
