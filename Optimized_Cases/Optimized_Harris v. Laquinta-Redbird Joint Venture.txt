Background:
A mother (appellant) filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a motel owner (appellee) following the drowning of her son, Ned Harris, in the motel's swimming pool. The case was heard in the 14th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), where a directed take nothing verdict was entered in favor of the motel owner, which meant that the mother received no compensation or relief from the court.

The mother contested that the motel owner was negligent due to the absence of a lifeguard, a lack of warning regarding the absence of a lifeguard, and non-compliance with Dallas City Ordinance No. 8479, which required certain safety equipment, including a "life pole or shepherd's crook type of pole," to be available at the pool. According to evidence, although there were two aluminum poles at the pool that bystanders used in an attempt to rescue her son, these poles did not have a hook or other pulling device, as arguably required by the ordinance.

Ned Harris had been swimming with others during an event called Explo '72. On the night of the incident, he began to struggle in the pool and called for help. His companions and other bystanders attempted to rescue him using the available aluminum poles, which lacked hooks or pulling devices, therefore they could only push him towards the shallow end. Despite their efforts, the rescue was delayed, and Ned Harris could not be revived once pulled from the water.

The interpretation of "life pole" as mentioned in the ordinance emerged as a key issue, with the mother's position supported by testimony from a city health department official who confirmed that "life pole" and "shepherd's crook" are synonymous and imply a pole with a U-shaped end designed for pulling.

Verdict: 
The court will reverse the directed take nothing verdict, concluding that the appellant mother presented a case justifiable for a jury to decide on the negligence and proximate cause regarding the motel owner's failure to provide a life pole according to the Dallas City Ordinance. The court will find that the verdict was improper because a life pole with a hook or other pulling device is technically different than a straight aluminum pole, which was what was provided.

The verdict will rely on the principle that if a local ordinance, aimed at preventing drowning by requiring a life pole that is suitable for lifesaving activities, is violated due to the absence of the necessary pole with pulling facilities, such a violation constitutes negligence per se. The evidence, including testimony, suggests that had proper equipment been available, a more rapid rescue could have been achieved, thus potentially preventing Ned Harris's drowning.

The court will also address the concept of proximate cause, suggesting there is sufficient evidence to infer that the lack of the correct life pole could have contributed to the inability to rescue the drowning victim in a timely manner. With this in mind, the mother will be entitled to have the negligence and the causal link between the motel ownerâ€™s actions and Ned Harris's death examined by a jury. Proximate cause, being a typical jury question, especially in cases where direct evidence of a rescue being possible is unlikely, will be considered as being based on the evidence that quick intervention could lead to successful resuscitation in many drowning incidents.

Given these points, the court will determine there was enough evidence presented to proceed to a jury on both negligence in the context of the ordinance and the proximate cause of Ned Harris's death. Thus, the mother's appeal will be successful, with the case remanded for a new trial where the jury will be tasked with deciding the issues laid out.
