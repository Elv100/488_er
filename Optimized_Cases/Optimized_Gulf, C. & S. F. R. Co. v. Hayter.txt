Background:
The case involves a railway accident in which a passenger was riding on a train operated by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company when it was struck by a freight train from the defendant railway company at a crossing. The collision did not involve a direct physical impact on the plaintiff's body, as he was not knocked off his seat but it caused him considerable fright. The plaintiff filed a negligence action against the railway company, seeking damages for personal injuries, claiming that the accident led to a nervous disorder known as traumatic neurasthenia. This condition was alleged to have been caused either by the physical jolt of the train's abrupt stop or the mental shock from the fright, or both. The trial court charged the jury with determining if the railway company's negligence led directly to the passenger's physical or mental shock, which then caused a disease or sickness. The jury found in favor of the passenger. The railway company argued that damages for fright or shock that do not accompany any physical injury or disturbance are not recoverable. They contended that such injuries are rare and not reasonably anticipated as a proximate result of negligence. Conversely, counsel for the defendant in error argued that if a railway company's negligence leads to a position of imminent peril that causes fright, and this fright then leads to illness, the negligence is the proximate cause of the injury and is actionable. They maintained that even if the physical harm consists mainly of nervous shock resulting in disease, the negligence can establish liability for fright. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the judgment.

Verdict:
Given the fact that the railway company's negligence resulted in a collision which caused direct mental and physical shock to the plaintiff, leading to the development of his condition (traumatic neurasthenia), the jury verdict is likely to be affirmed by the higher court. The reasoning will likely focus on the recognition of mental shock as a possible cause of physical injury when it is a direct result of negligence. This view is informed by modern science which acknowledges that mental emotions like fright can have tangible physical effects, such as in this case, where a mental shock resulted in a debilitating nervous disorder. The court's analysis will likely revolve around the concept of proximate cause, and whether the mental and resultant physical injuries could have been a foreseeable consequence of the railway company's negligence. Looking at the specific circumstances of this case, it's probable that the court will conclude that the foreseeable nature of the injuries and the proximate cause condition is satisfied. Therefore, the court's detailed reasoning will hinge on the significance of recognizing both mental and physical repercussions of a wrongful act, even if the injuries primarily involve mental or emotional disturbances with subsequent physical manifestations. The precedent set by prior similar cases and the testimony provided about the effects of fright on physical health will likely contribute to buttressing the validity of the plaintiff's claim and the decision to affirm the jury's verdict in favor of the passenger.
