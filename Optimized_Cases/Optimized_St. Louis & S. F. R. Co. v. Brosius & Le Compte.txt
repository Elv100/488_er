Background: 
The appellants, Brosius & Le Compte, were partners in a business that involved buying, shipping, and selling mules in Paris, Texas. On January 6, 1906, J.B. Brosius bought 24 mules in Lockwood, Missouri, which were to be shipped back to Paris, Texas, for sale. The mules were loaded into a car provided by the appellant, the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, around two o'clock in the afternoon and were shipped via Monett, Missouri, Ft. Smith, Arkansas, and Hugo, Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. The car with the mules arrived in Monett around 2:15 AM on January 7th and was held there until about 5 PM the same day. Brosius, who accompanied the train containing the mules' car, proceeded to Paris when he was informed the mules would not be unloaded in Monett. 

The mules were eventually unloaded in Monett the morning of January 7th, at around 9:30 AM, supposedly to comply with a federal law requiring stock to be unloaded, watered, fed, and rested, before being loaded back into the car around 5:30 PM. They reached Paris just after midnight on January 9th. Upon unloading, it was discovered that one mule had a large cut on its hip, while another, a large bay mare mule, was sick with pneumonia in its second stage and subsequently died. The case revolved around Brosius & Le Compte suing for damages to both the injured mule and for the value of the mule that died. They alleged the bay mule contracted a cold leading to pneumonia due to negligence on the part of the appellants, including unnecessary and unusual delay in transit and conditions endured whilst held at Monett. They alleged the injured mule was hurt due to negligent handling during loading and unloading in Monett and due to a projecting bolt in the car.

The appellants denied any negligence, claimed the trial court's instructions to the jury about their negligence were erroneous since they were not specific to each incident with each mule, and argued that there was insufficient testimony to support negligence causing the death of the mule from pneumonia.

Verdict:
Given the details of the background, the verdict will likely focus on issues of burden of proof, the differentiation of claims for each mule, and the sufficiency of evidence regarding causality of the alleged negligence. The verdict would likely reverse the trial court's judgment for the merchants and remand the cause for further proceedings, primarily because the trial court issued an undifferentiated jury instruction for negligence across both incidents. This could have confused the jury into attributing the same cause to both the injured and the deceased mule without proper evidence of negligence for each individual case. This generalized approach could lead the appellate court to conclude that, while there may have been sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence in the injury to the mule caused by a projecting bolt in the train car, that same assumption of negligence should not automatically extend to the case of the mule that developed pneumonia.

Furthermore, the appellate court may determine that the court erred in allowing the question of a valuable consideration in the contractual agreement between the merchants and the railway company to go before the jury, which should have presumed a valuable consideration for a written contract. Additionally, the court may find that the evidence was insufficient to support that any act or omission by the appellants led to the death of one of the mules due to pneumonia. The evidence presented to suggest that the mule with pneumonia had contracted the illness due to the exposure in Monett appears circumstantial, and the testimony does not conclusively establish that the appellant's actions were the proximate cause of the illness and death. Given these points, the appellate court will likely find that the merchants did not meet their burden of proving negligence on the part of the railroad company for the death of the mule from pneumonia. Thus, the decision will probably focus on remanding the case for retrial to more accurately assess any act of negligence concerning each animal and evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence surrounding the death of the mule due to pneumonia.
