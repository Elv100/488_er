Background:
The appellant, JCW Electronics, Inc. ("JCW"), a telephone service provider, entered into a contract with the City of Port Isabel to provide telephone services for the Port Isabel City Jail. As per the contract, JCW installed a coinless telephone inside each jail cell for inmates to make collect calls. Rolando Domingo Montez, a 19-year-old, was arrested for public intoxication and placed in Cell No. 1 of the Port Isabel City Jail. The day after Montez made several calls requesting bail, he was found dead in his cell, having hanged himself with the telephone cord. Appellees, Pearl Iriz Garza, individually and on behalf of Montez's estate, and Belinda Leigh Camacho, individually and as next friend of Montez's minor child, sued JCW claiming negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, strict liability, and misrepresentation.

The jury found in favor of the appellees on negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of implied warranty of fitness. No damages were found for Camacho in her individual capacity. Post-verdict, appellees filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, seeking judgment for breach of contract and fraud, which the trial court granted. The trial court awarded the appellees attorneys' fees, guardian ad litem fees, and costs. JCW appealed, challenging the trial court's judgment on grounds that breach of contract was not pleaded or tried by consent and that if appellees successfully pleaded fraud, they were barred from recovering damages due to the jury finding that 60% of the responsibility for the inmate's death was his own. JCW further disputed the sufficiency of the evidence for breach of implied warranty of fitness and the award of costs and attorney fees.

Verdict:
The appellate court found that the trial court erred regarding the breach of contract claim since it was not properly pleaded, submitted to the jury, or tried by consent. As breach of contract and breach of warranty are separate causes of action, they must be separately pleaded. Since appellees' pleadings did not explicitly state a claim for breach of contract, JCW was not required to file special exceptions to this unraised cause.

Concerning the fraud claim, chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code barred appellees from recovering damages because the jury found Montez to be more than 50% responsible for his death, disallowing damages in tort-based claims above that threshold.

The appellate court also acknowledged that there was more than a scintilla of evidence suggesting that the telephones were not safe for the particular purpose of unattended or unsupervised use by inmates. Thus, the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to show causation directly related to the presence of the telephone in the jail cell. Hence, the jury's decision for breach of implied warranty of fitness was supported.

Moreover, the court examined the award of attorney fees and costs. It concluded that the award of attorney fees was improper, as such fees are not recoverable for a UCC breach of warranty claim. The court modified the award of costs, affirming appropriate costs for filing, court reporter fees, and guardian ad litem fees and removing awards for expert witness travel, per diem expenses, and photocopying costs which were not required by law.

The judgement was reversed concerning the award of attorney fees and certain costs, and modified to emphasize breach of implied warranty of fitness as a cause of action. The verdict as modified was affirmed, supporting the findings of breach of implied warranty of fitness but not breach of contract or recovery of fraud, according to the evidence and given legal standards.
