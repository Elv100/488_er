Background:
The husband of a woman who swallowed glass from a bottle of soda produced by the Texas Coca-Cola Bottling Company filed a lawsuit to recover damages for his wife's injuries. The wife had consumed the soda, discovered broken glass inside, and was purportedly injured as a result. A trial court jury found the company negligent and liable for the injuries she sustained. The company appealed the judgment. They argued firstly that the jury should not have been informed about the company carrying indemnity insurance, which was disclosed during cross-examination. However, the court noted that such a revelation was volunteered by the defense, excusing the issue. The main contention of the appeal was whether the award for pain, suffering, and incapacity could include issues relating to pre-existing conditions the wife might have had. The husband confirmed she had had several operations prior to the incident but claimed she was healthy at the time of the glass ingestion. The company maintained that some of the wife's suffering was related to these prior conditions unrelated to the incident. Ultimately, the jury awarded the plaintiff $15,125, deciding the physical suffering was not solely due to previous health issues.

Verdict:
The appellate court reversed the trial court decision. The judges will likely conclude that the instructions given to the jury failed to adequately guide them to consider whether a portion of the wife's suffering and incapacity was attributable to pre-existing conditions that were not aggravated by swallowing glass.  Despite the jury finding that the suffering was not solely due to previous disease, the appellate court will reconcile this with the evidence suggesting that at least some health issues could have predated and existed independently of the incident. The testimony from medical professionals about the expected healing process for a cut in the stomach and the fact that ulcers are not commonly caused by ingesting foreign objects will be particularly persuasive. The court will emphasize that the defendant should only be liable for pain and incapacities caused by negligence (i.e., the glass ingestion), excluding those stemming from any pre-existing conditions unless those conditions were exacerbated by the incident.

The court will reference the Texas Supreme Court precedent set forth in the Ector case, offering clear guidance: where evidence raises an issue that part of claimed injuries could be due to pre-existing conditions, specific jury instructions should exclude damages related to those pre-existing conditions not aggravated by the defendant's negligence. As such, they will argue that standard explanations or definitions for damages should exclude those components not attributable to the defendant's actions, providing further context to the jury.

The verdict will similarly draw upon additional cases cited in the background illustrating the required precision in jury instructions to isolate damages directly linked to the alleged negligence from those which might stem from a previous or unrelated condition. Hence, the appellate court will assert that the trial court erred by not providing explicit instructions to the jury to evaluate and omit elements of damages unrelated to the glass ingestion. 

The reversal will lead to the appellate court remanding the case for further proceedings, potentially including a retrial where the jury will be properly instructed on what damages they can consider based on the defendant's proven negligence.
