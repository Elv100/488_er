{Background: Members of the Assembly of God Church in Kaufman, Texas, experienced a power outage on January 21, 1998, due to a lightning strike that hit a nearby transformer. Pastor D.G. Council called 9-1-1 and was informed that Texas Utilities Electric Company (T.U.) would restore the power as soon as possible. The church members left the building safely, and no one checked for tripped breakers. The next day, the church still had no power, and after multiple checks by church officials, it was clear there was no exterior damage to the church. In the evening, Gary Graves, the church's music director, reported the outage to Council, who then called T.U.'s emergency line, requesting to be informed when power would be restored. A senior serviceman from T.U. was dispatched, found lightning damage to the pole facility serving the church, and was instructed to replace the transformers that evening. The repair crew did not notify Council, despite his request and Council not answering when they tried to reach him. After repairs, power was restored, and within an hour, the church was on fire, ultimately leading to the sanctuary's destruction.

The church sued T.U. for negligence and gross negligence in repairing and restoring power. T.U. filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that their possible negligence did not exclusively cause the damages and citing a tariff that limited its liability. This tariff stipulated that T.U. was not liable for damages from faulty downstream wiring or acts of God unless T.U.'s negligence was the sole proximate cause. The church challenged the tariff as unreasonable and in violation of the Texas Constitution.

T.U. presented evidence from the repairs and the incident, including oral depositions, statements, experts' reports, and the tariff; the trial court granted the summary judgment without specifying grounds, leading to this appeal. The church argued that T.U. did not negate its negligence as the sole proximate cause; that T.U.'s conduct was grossly negligent; and that the service tariff was unreasonable and unconstitutional.}

{Verdict: When reviewing the appeals court's affirmation of the trial court's judgment, it will focus on the church's claims against T.U. and the reasonableness of the service tariff. The court will find that the tariff is indeed reasonable as it pertains to economic damages, as it has been approved by the Public Utility Commission (P.U.C.) and only holds the utility liable if its negligence is the sole proximate cause of damages. This aligns with Texas law, which traditionally finds such tariffs reasonable on their face when applied to economic damages caused by an utility's ordinary negligence.

As for the negligence claim, the appellate court will resolve that the church has not presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether T.U.'s alleged negligence was the sole proximate cause of the fire and resulting damages. The evidence will suggest that there were multiple proximate causes for the fire, including the initial lightning strike, possible damage to internal wiring, a failure by the church to turn off equipment after the outage, and the restoration of power. Since there cannot be one sole cause when multiple factors led to the fire, the court will hold that the church has not met the standard imposed by the tariff for T.U. to be liable.

Regarding gross negligence, the court will determine that the church has failed to present evidence that T.U.'s conduct both involved an extreme risk considering the potential harm and that T.U. had actual subjective awareness of that risk and nevertheless proceeded with conscious indifference. Without such evidence, the church cannot show that T.U.'s conduct went beyond ordinary negligence to gross negligence.

Consequently, the appeals court will overrule all three points of error raised by the church and affirm the trial court's judgment, meaning T.U. will not be held liable for the damage to the church's property.}
