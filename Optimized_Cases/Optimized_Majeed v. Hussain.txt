Background:
This case revolves around a premises-liability lawsuit filed by Sajjad Hussain, a clerk at a convenience store and gas station, against the owners of the premises, including appellant Tariq Majeed. Hussain attributes his injury, which resulted in permanent vision loss in his right eye, to an assault by an unidentified male who threw a can of "Fix-a-Flat Tire" through a sliding glass "drive-through" window at him during his shift. Hussain alleges that the owners, Majeed and a co-defendant, Muhammed Naeem, were negligent by failing to install bulletproof glass in the window and other reasonable security measures to protect against a foreseeable risk of crime, given that the incident occurred in a high-crime area. 

The trial took place without the presence of Majeed or Naeem, with Majeed represented by counsel and Naeem having left the country. Majeed was incarcerated at the time for unrelated offenses. Hussain was the only witness to testify in person, describing his responsibilities, the broken condition of the sliding glass window, and the circumstances of the assault. In the end, the jury found Majeed's negligence had proximately caused Hussain's injuries, rejecting Majeed's motion for a directed verdict, which was not re-urged after the close of evidence. They awarded Hussain $377,811.19 in damages.

Majeed appealed, contending there was insufficient evidence of a foreseeable risk of harm, a duty of care, a breach of duty causing harm, and the amount of damages awarded. Majeed also contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish cause in fact because there was only speculation about whether a bulletproof window would have been closed at the time of the assault. Furthermore, Majeed argued that other no-evidence complaints were preserved for appeal despite not re-urging the directed-verdict motion at the close of evidence because they were included in a motion for a new trial.

Verdict:
The appeals court will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new trial, focusing on the proximate cause issue. Predicting the court's reasoning, they will explain that to establish proximate cause, an act or omission must be a substantial factor in causing the injury without which the harm would not have occurred. The appeals court will find there is legally insufficient evidence or at best, factually insufficient evidence of proximate cause, particularly concerning the cause-in-fact. It will contend that the jury could only have speculated whether the window, if repaired and made of bulletproof glass, would have been closed at the time of the assault. Furthermore, since Hussain did not see the customer pick up the can and was surprised by the throw, it suggests that even if the window were capable of being closed, Hussain could not have foreseen and prevented the injury by closing the window.

The appeals court will also note that there is no evidence suggesting the presence of a security guard or other measures would have prevented the attack, given its sudden nature. Based on these factors, the court will determine that the injury would not necessarily have been prevented by the alleged negligence by Majeedâ€”that there is no evidence that Hussain's injury would not have occurred but for the lack of bulletproof glass or other security measures. Therefore, the court will conclude that the evidence of causation is either legally or factually insufficient, sustaining Majeed's second issue on appeal and rendering the remaining issues moot, resulting in a new trial focused on Hussain's claims.
