Background:
Charlcie Pink, widow of the decedent Veryl L. Pink, maintained a lawsuit against Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear) and several product suppliers, including Texaco Refining & Marketing, Inc. (Texaco), alleging that her husband's renal cell carcinoma was caused by exposure to benzene during his employment at Goodyear from approximately 1963 to 1997. Following Veryl Pink's death in 2005, the 172nd District Court in Jefferson County, Texas, granted a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Goodyear and a take-nothing judgment in favor of Texaco. The lawsuit against Texaco was voluntarily discontinued by the widow in trial court. The company had a duty to provide a safe workplace under Tex. Lab. Code Ann. ยง 411.103 (2006). The treating oncologist, Dr. Mahesh Kanojia, submitted an affidavit stating that the cause of Mr. Pink's renal cell carcinoma was probably exposure to benzene. The affidavit cited materials he consulted, including Mr. Pink's medical records, deposition testimony of Mr. Pink and co-workers, and scientific literature. Goodyear filed objections to the reliability of the oncologist's affidavit based on Borg-Warner Corporation v. Flores and Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Havner, arguing that it lacked the necessary analysis to establish a causal link between benzene exposure and the cancer. The trial court did not expressly rule on the reliability objections or conduct a hearing under Tex. R. Evid. 104(a) concerning this matter.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the judgment as to the claim against Texaco because the widow had voluntarily discontinued the lawsuit against Texaco at the trial level, and therefore, could not raise objections for the first time on appeal. However, the court reversed the summary judgment as to Goodyear, since Pink produced some evidence supporting the elements of her claim against Goodyear. The court opined that the treating oncologist's opinion was not conclusory as a matter of law because it referenced the materials consulted. Without an express ruling on the reliability of Dr. Kanojia's causation opinion, his affidavit remained part of the summary judgment proof, providing some evidence against the no-evidence motion for summary judgment on causation. The court will not consider Goodyear's reliability objections as implicitly sustained by the trial court due to the absence of a hearing on this issue under Rule 104(a). The case was remanded for further proceedings, as the necessary process missing was a hearing under Tex. R. Evid. 104(a) to examine the reliability of the evidence provided by Dr. Kanojia. The appellate court anticipated that the trial court may decide whether the expert's affidavit must be stricken due to unreliable foundational data, methodology, or technique, or may allow the opportunity to obtain additional evidence to support the claims. In conclusion, without a clear express ruling that the treating oncologist's causation opinion is unreliable, the reverse and remand decision is justified.
