{Background: The plaintiff, Monte Puryear, filed a malpractice suit against Dr. G. G. Porter, Dr. J. A. Finer, and anesthetist T. W. Baker, claiming that the improper administration of a spinal anesthetic resulted in his paralysis below the level of the sixth dorsal vertebra. The plaintiff asserted that the anesthetic needle was inserted between the first lumbar and sixth dorsal vertebra, causing a rupture and contusion of the spinal cord and resulting in total paralysis of his lower extremities. The jury found that Baker injected the spinal needle into Puryear's spinal cord above the level of the first lumbar vertebra, which they deemed to be negligence and the proximate cause of his injury. They awarded Puryear $134,860 in damages.

The physicians' defense focused on multiple points of error. They contested the location of the needle puncture, whether it was correctly found above the first lumbar vertebra, and whether the injection into the spinal cord was established as the negligence that proximately caused the paralysis. While there was testimony on the unusual nature of spinal needle injection above the first lumbar vertebra as a medical proposition, osteopathic physicians did not testify establishing proximate cause. Medical testimony suggested that paralysis like Puryear's could not be caused by an injection at or below the cauda equina (lower back), but there was no consensus from either osteopaths or medical doctors directly linking the needle injection to the paralysis.

Subsequently, the case raised questions about the roles and relationships between the defendants. Dr. Porter argued that Baker was acting under his payment and directives, rendering him a joint venturer and the anesthetist's acts as his duty. Dr. Finer, involved in the administration of the spinal anesthetic, was also implicated as engaged in a joint venture with Dr. Porter. The appeal challenged evidentiary support for negligence, proximate cause, the scope of employment of Baker, and the relationship between the doctors.

As part of the arguments, the plaintiff's attorney made inflammatory statements regarding an unrelated malpractice case concerning one of the defendants, prompting the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the advocate's comments.}

{Verdict: The appellate court will analyze each point of error meticulously. Concerning the location of the needle puncture and the evidence supporting the jury's negligence finding, the court will likely overrule the appellants' arguments, indicating that the evidence is indeed sufficient to support the jury's determination that the spinal puncture occurred above the first lumbar vertebra and that such a procedure was considered negligent according to medical experts from multiple schools of practice.

However, the court will concur with the appellants on the point concerning proximate cause. Due to the lack of osteopathic physician testimony directly linking the needle injection to Puryear's paralysis and the testimony from expert witnesses of both medical schools that a spinal needle injection into the spinal cord would not directly cause paralysis, the appellate court will find that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's finding on proximate cause. Consequently, this point will be sustained since negligence and proximate cause must be testified to by an expert from the same school of practice as the defendant in malpractice cases, and the plaintiff failed to provide such testimony from osteopathic physicians.

Regarding the joint venture and employment scope points, the court will find substantial undisputed evidence that both Dr. Porter and Dr. Finer were engaged in a joint venture and that Baker was acting within the scope of employment under Dr. Porter when administering the anesthesia, thus rendering Factors Four A, Four B, and Five moot in light of the sustained error on proximate cause.

The court will also address the irreparable prejudice caused by the plaintiff's attorney's inflammatory comments about an unrelated malpractice suit against a defense witness, noting that such statements could have warranted a reversal alone had they been preserved as a point of error on appeal. In the absence of that point, they will be dismissed with guidance for the next trial to limit evidence of witness interest to relevant, non-inflammatory information.

Ultimately, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed on the basis of the error in establishing proximate cause, and no testimony from any osteopathic physician substantiating this link, in conjunction with the court's findings on the other points of error. The case will be remanded for a new trial, where the plaintiff will have to provide sufficient evidence from an osteopathic physician to prove both negligence and proximate cause, and avoid prejudicial statements.}
