Background:
Thad Manchac, a 44-year-old with a bioprosthetic aortic valve, developed pneumonia and was hospitalized at Memorial Hermann - The Woodlands. After being discharged, he continued to experience health issues, including epigastric fullness and pressure in his abdomen. He was referred to a cardiologist, Dr. Brenda Peabody, to address the discomfort. An echocardiogram indicated severe issues with his aortic valve and a diagnosis of "1) prosthetic aortic valve regurgitation and 2) endocarditis of prosthetic valve." Dr. Peabody noted that Mr. Manchac required immediate aortic valve replacement and a consultation with a cardiovascular surgeon was needed. Despite this, Mr. Manchac was discharged after the outpatient procedure. 

Three days later, Mr. Manchac saw Dr. Charles Sims, an infectious disease doctor, upon Dr. Peabody's referral. Dr. Sims recommended valve replacement surgery, post-antibiotics period. Blood cultures were taken, but no immediate action or hospital admission was recommended. 

Mr. Manchac then suddenly passed away due to complications from aortic valve disease. An autopsy indicated a calcified thrombus obstructing Mr. Manchac's prosthetic aortic valve. The Manchac family filed a medical malpractice suit against St. Luke's Lakeside Hospital, Dr. Peabody, Dr. Sims, and Greater Houston Physician's Medical Association, alleging negligence in the treatment provided and the failure to prevent Mr. Manchac's early discharge from the hospital. They served expert reports criticizing the care provided, but each appellant (the defendants) contested the sufficiency of these reports and moved for dismissal, which the trial court denied.

The appellants appealed the denial of their motions to dismiss, arguing that the expert reports were insufficient and did not meet the requirements of the Texas Medical Liability Act - specifically, that the reports were conclusory, did not establish the required standards of care, and failed to demonstrate causation adequately.

Verdict:
The court considers each appellant's claim in turn, assessing whether the expert reports provide a sufficient connection between the alleged breaches of standard care by each medical provider and Mr. Manchac's death.

For St. Luke's appeal, the court concludes that expert reports from Nurse Kimberly Roberts and Dr. Paul S. Brown, when read together, link the nurses' alleged breach of standard care to Mr. Manchac's death. Specifically, Roberts' views on a nurse's responsibility to ensure patient understanding and coordination of care, and Dr. Brown’s views on causation establish the necessary connection. 

Regarding Dr. Peabody, the court finds Dr. Julie Anne Kovach's and Dr. Brown's expert reports sufficient. Both reports assert that immediate hospital admission was required after the TEE procedure, and had that occurred, the necessary surgery would very likely have been performed within 72 hours—potentially saving Mr. Manchac's life.

For Dr. Sims and Greater Houston Physician's Medical Association, the court again finds the reports of Dr. Stephen K. Felts and Dr. Brown adequate, as they lay out the expected course of action after the TEE results and the consequences of failing to admit Mr. Manchac for immediate surgical consultation.

The court will ultimately affirm the judgment, ruling that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions to dismiss. The expert reports are considered to represent a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the Act, providing a fair summary of how the medical providers allegedly breached their respective standards of care and how that breach was causally linked to Mr. Manchac's death. The reasoning accounts for the appellants' ability and authority to intervene and prevent the discharge or initiate further medical action. The reports do not merely speculate but draw from the experts' knowledge, experience, and the established standards of care within their respective fields. Thus, the verdict affirms that the claims against the appellants have sufficient merit to proceed, and the dismissal of the suit is not warranted at this stage of the litigation.
