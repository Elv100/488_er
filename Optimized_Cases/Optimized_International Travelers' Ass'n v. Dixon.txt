Background:
The insured, Thomas H. Dixon, while engaged in gardening activities on his property, encountered a weed difficult to pull from the ground. Upon exerting a strong pull, the weed gave way, causing Dixon to fall backward and strike the ground with considerable force on his right side, injuring his head, side, and leg. Shortly after the incident, Dixon experienced complete paralysis on the right side of his body. At the trial, Dixon's physician testified that such a fall and impact could cause the rupture of a blood vessel, which in Dixon's case led to paralysis due to this rupture impacting his brain. The physician also testified that if the rupture had occurred before the fall, Dixon would not have been able to walk into his house as he did. Prior to this event, Dixon claimed to have been in perfect health, with no symptoms indicative of an imminent rupture.

The insurer contended that Dixon’s paralysis was not caused exclusively by an accidental fall but was due to a pre-existing condition of high blood pressure, which could have contributed to the rupture of the artery. The trial court jury found that Dixon’s fall was accidental and was the direct and proximate cause of his paralysis. The insurer appealed, disputing the trial court's judgment and maintaining that the findings were contrary to the evidence.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the trial court's judgment. The reason is that the evidence demonstrated that the rupture of the artery, leading to Dixon's paralysis, was directly and proximately caused by the fall. It is likely that the court will reason that while the insurer raised the possibility of Dixon's high blood pressure being a contributing factor, there was no direct evidence of such a medical condition at the time of the accident. The physicians’ opinions pointed out the potential for pre-existing high blood pressure without firm evidence that it existed in a severe form before the accident.

The court will find that the matter of causation was appropriately left to the jury, which concluded that the accidental fall was the emanative cause of the injury Dixon suffered. It will be determined that even if Dixon had some pre-existing susceptibility due to blood pressure, it does not negate the liability for the accident since the rupture and subsequent paralysis were the immediate results of the fall.

Furthermore, the court will address the insurer's argument regarding the conditions of the policy. The appellate court will clarify that the policy covers injuries that occur through purely accidental means even if they aggravate or accelerate a pre-existing condition, provided the accidental means were the sole cause at the time of occurrence. The requested instructions by the insurer that were refused by the trial court will be deemed unnecessary, as the jury was adequately and correctly guided to decide whether the fall was accidental and directly caused the paralysis, exclusive of any other conditions.

Overall, the appellate court will reject the insurer's contention that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and affirm the trial court's findings in favor of the insured, Dixon.
