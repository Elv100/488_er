Background:
In 2000, Eloisa Casas was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A year later, medical professionals believed the cancer was in remission. However, on July 10, 2001, she was admitted to Rio Grande Regional Hospital with abdominal pains, fever, and a mildly elevated white-blood-cell count, suggesting a potential infection. Dr. Carlos Garcia-Cantu, her surgeon and primary physician, consulted with infectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Jelinek. Dr. Jelinek prescribed Maxipime and Flagyl on July 11 to prevent certain intra-abdominal infections.

Casas underwent major abdominal surgery on July 13, revealing metastatic cancer perforating her colon, allowing material to leak into her abdominal cavity and causing an intra-abdominal abscess. Dr. Garcia-Cantu drained the abscess, repaired the colon, and inserted a drain to prevent further issues. The antibiotics were continued post-surgery, and a culture revealed an E. coli infection effectively treated by Maxipime. The hospital staff, however, failed to renew the prescriptions after five more days, causing a four-and-a-half-day lapse in medication between July 18 and 23. During this period, Casas did not receive Maxipime or Flagyl but was prescribed Diflucan for Candida (a fungus) and Vancomycin for coagulase-negative staph infections, neither of which Maxipime nor Flagyl would have treated.

Casas developed an abscess in her wound on July 23, which was drained by reopening the wound. The next day, the wound emitted a foul smell. Upon learning of the prescription lapse, Dr. Jelinek immediately prescribed different antibiotics, Levaquin and Vancomycin. After a CAT scan showed no abscess, the drain was removed on July 25. Casas was discharged on August 23, readmitted in early September, and died two months later.

Several family members filed a lawsuit against the Hospital, Dr. Garcia-Cantu, and Dr. Jelinek in May 2003, claiming their negligence caused Casas to suffer extreme pain and mental anguish beyond what would have occurred with proper care. An expert report was submitted, and Dr. Jelinek later filed a motion for sanctions and dismissal because the expert report did not sufficiently establish causation between the negligence and the injury. The trial court denied the motion. Before trial, the family nonsuited Dr. Jelinek and Dr. Garcia-Cantu.

At trial, the jury found the defendants' negligence caused Casas's injury, assigning the majority of fault to the Hospital and a smaller percentage to each doctor. $250,000 in damages were awarded for Casas's pain and mental anguish. The Hospital and Dr. Jelinek appealed the decision, with the latter contesting the denial of his motion for sanctions and dismissal. The court of appeals affirmed all issues.

Verdict:
The court of appeals' judgment was reversed, and a new judgment was rendered that the family take nothing due to insufficient evidence connecting the Hospital's negligence to Casas's additional pain. Despite admitting the antibiotics should have been continuous, the absence of evidence suggesting an infection treatable by the omitted antibiotics negated the claim since Casas experienced other infections during that time which accounted for her symptoms.

As for Dr. Jelinek's petition, the court agreed that the trial court should have granted his motion for sanctions and dismissal because the expert report failed to establish causation adequately. The expert report concluded, without explanation, that Dr. Jelinek's breach of the standard of care resulted in increased pain and a prolonged hospital stay for Casas. As the plaintiff bears the burden of proving negligence caused the injury, the report did not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the claims had merit.

The expert's testimony did not explain why an undetected, anaerobic infection was more probable than the other known infections and dying tissue, leaving the jury to speculate. Expert testimony must explain the basis of its conclusions and link them to the facts. Without a more definitive explanation drawing a connection between the negligence and the injury, this expert testimony was not found legally sufficient.

Consequently, the case was remanded to the trial court for an award of attorney's fees and costs against the Casas family and their counsel. The supreme court granted Dr. Jelinek's request for review, wherein the testimony of family members and the absent expert testimony linking the prescription lapse to additional pain and suffering were found insufficient for establishing causation. The jury verdict was thus based on legally insufficient evidence, reversing the previous decision and rendering a judgment for Dr. Jelinek to take nothing.
