{ Background: The appellant beneficiary initiated a lawsuit to recover from an insurance policy after the employee, Eli H. Landman, covered under the company-provided accidental loss benefits policy, died following an automobile accident. The insurance policy was issued by the appellee, Union Mutual Life Insurance Company, to Binswanger Glass Company, and provided accidental loss benefits to eligible employees, including Landman, who died after an accident on December 1, 1969. The insurance policy defined "injury" as bodily harm caused by an accident that results directly and independently of other causes. The policy excluded coverage for any loss caused by or resulting from disease. The appellee insurance company presented an affirmative defense in the suit, contending that Landman's death was not solely from accidental injuries sustained in the accident but was also proximately caused or contributed to by his pre-existing heart and lung diseases. The case focused on conflicting evidence about Landman's cause of death. The autopsy report listed the cause of death due to hepatic lacerations and external trauma but also noted significant conditions such as pulmonary emphysema and cardiac hypertrophy.

During the trial, the jury was presented with several material issues, specifically around the cause of deathâ€”whether it was a result directly and independently from the automobile accident (to which the jury responded 'Yes') and whether Landman's pre-existing lung and heart diseases were proximate causes of his death (to which the jury also responded affirmatively, indicating these diseases were proximate causes). Based on these seemingly contradictory answers, the trial court entered a take-nothing judgment in favor of the appellee, against which the appellant is now appealing. 

The appellant contends that the answers to the jury's special issues are so irreconcilably conflicting that the judgment based on them should be reversed for a new trial. The appellant refers to rules indicating that conflicting findings on material facts create a fatal conflict, which means the verdict cannot stand. It is emphasized that in insurance cases where accidental injury is at play, it is the plaintiff's burden to show the injury was independently of all other causes. Similarly, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that any alleged disease was not a proximate cause when the insurer has presented such a condition as an affirmative defense. The Supreme Court has previously indicated that "independently of all other causes" means "solely," "only," or "standing alone.". 

Verdict: Based on the detailed background, the judgment is predicted to be reversed and remanded due to the irreconcilable answers provided by the jury. The jury found that the death resulted both independently from the accident and was also caused by pre-existing diseases. This presents a conflict since the insurance policy requires the cause of death to be solely due to an accident. The juridical principle that conflicting findings cannot legally support a judgment will likely lead to the original judgment being set aside. The appellate court will probably not accept forced or strained constructions of the jury's findings to reconcile the contradiction. As a result, the judgment in favor of the appellee will be overturned and the case sent back for a new trial because the appellant was entitled to a verdict in her favor based on the answer to Special Issue No. 1 alone, while conversely, the appellee was entitled to a verdict based on the answers to Special Issues No. 3 and No. 4 alone. Therefore, the appellate court will conclude that the answers are in fatal conflict, necessitating a reversal and remand for a new trial where these issues can be resolved without contradiction. }
