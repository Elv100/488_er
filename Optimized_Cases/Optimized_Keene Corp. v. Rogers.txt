Background:
Jessie Rogers and Robert Lofton, two individuals who suffered from asbestos-related illnesses, along with their wives (Eleanor Rogers and Jo Emma Lofton), filed two consolidated cases against Keene Corporation, a manufacturer of asbestos-containing products. Rogers, a former boilermaker and insulator helper, was diagnosed with asbestosis, while Lofton, a former longshoreman, had mesothelioma, both due to occupational exposure to asbestos products, including those made by Keene. The plaintiffs alleged their ailments resulted from occupational exposure, seeking compensation for loss of consortium and other damages. During the trial, all defendants except Keene settled with the plaintiffs. 

The trial was presided over by Judge Joe Brown, whose son-in-law, Andy Waters, became an associate at Baron & Budd, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, during the course of the trial. Keene Corporation filed a motion for Judge Brown to recuse himself on this basis, which the trial court denied. This denial was confirmed by the Presiding Judge of the First Administrative Judicial District. Keene's motion centered on concerns about the impartiality of the judge due to his familial connection to an employee of the plaintiffs’ legal firm.

The trial resulted in judgments for five plaintiffs, but Keene only appealed the judgment for the Rogerses and the Loftons. They were awarded a combined $1.8 million in damages; after offsets for settlements with other defendants, the combined sum was $780,700. 

Keene raised several points of error on appeal. These focused on the recusal issue, the exclusion of "frequency, regularity, and proximity" from the term "exposure" in the jury charge, the exclusion of foreseeability from the definition of proximate cause, definition of "unreasonably dangerous," and procedural errors including the admission of hearsay and unauthenticated expert testimony. Specifically, Keene took issue with admitting a video deposition of Dr. Joseph Wagoner, an epidemiologist, along with two reports allegedly written by him, questioning the authenticity and evidential basis. The appellants’ firm counsel contended that the video deposition was hearsay and not properly authenticated, claiming it had been wrongfully admitted into evidence.

Verdict:
The appellate court upheld the trial court's decision, ruling against Keene Corporation’s contentions. It found no abuse of discretion regarding the recusal of Judge Brown, based on the lack of evidence that his son-in-law, being a salaried employee who is not tied financially to the case's outcome, was substantially affected by the trial's outcome or that the judge’s impartiality could reasonably be questioned. The court also ruled that the term "exposure" did not require explicit definition linking it to causation, as jury questions were adequate in addressing causation later in the charge. 

The verdict reaffirmed the jury's instructions which excluded foreseeability from proximate cause, in alignment with Alabama law, which applied to the case, and upheld the term "unreasonably dangerous" as defined for the ordinary consumer and determined the trial court did not err in these respects.

Errors recognized by the court regarding the admission of Dr. Wagoner's video deposition and reports were deemed harmless as evidence was deemed cumulative of a large body of other evidence that was properly admitted. The appellate court emphasized that such erroneous admission was not calculated to cause the rendition of an improper judgment.

Consequently, Keene’s appeal of the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was not successful and the decision was affirmed, maintaining the award for damages to the Rogerses and the Loftons. Keene could only have prevailed on the appeal if the court had found the alleged errors to have been harmful rather than harmless.
