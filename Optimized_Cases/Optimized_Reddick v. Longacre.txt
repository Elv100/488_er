Background:
The incident in question involves a collision between a butane truck, owned by appellant J. E. Reddick and driven by his driver, J. T. Abbott, and a produce truck. Following the collision, the butane truck caught fire and rolled into a ditch and up onto a railroad. The appellee, Ward Longacre, witnessed the incident and, seeing Abbott slumped over the wheel and appearing unconscious, bravely rescued him from the burning butane truck. However, as a result of the rescue effort, Longacre was injured when the truck subsequently exploded. Longacre then sued Reddick and Abbott for his injuries. 

Reddick and Abbott, suggesting that the collision was caused by the negligence of the produce truck's driver, filed for contribution against the second truck's owners and operators, Bailey, McCurdy, and Jackson. The trial court found in favor of the rescuer, Longacre, and against Reddick and Abbott. It also denied recovery for contribution from Bailey, McCurdy, and Jackson, thus rejecting the motions by Reddick and Abbott for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury.

The court noted that the jury was asked to resolve a factual dispute concerning the movement of the butane truck and the actions of the produce truck driver to avoid a head-on collision. The jury answered several issues, determining that Abbott was negligent in various ways such as driving on the wrong side of the road, failing to stop, and failing to keep a proper lookout. The jury found that these negligent acts were proximate causes of Longacre's injuries. Additionally, the jury found that Abbott had discovered a perilous situation in time to avoid the accident but failed to do so, which was also a proximate cause of injuries to the rescuer.

The jury determined that Longacre acted correctly in his attempt to rescue Abbott, holding that one who attempts to rescue another cannot be found contributorily negligent unless he or she acts in a rash or imprudent manner. The jury also determined that Longacre did not act rashly or assume risk when aiding Abbott. Contributions from the owner and operator of the produce truck were denied because their actions were not found negligent. They were also found to have acted in a way that a reasonable and prudent person would under similar circumstances.

Verdict:
The appeals court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court explained that the jury had thoroughly reviewed the facts and resolved whether the driver of the produce truck was negligent and whether the truck's sudden leftward movement to avoid a collision was a reasonable and prudent action. As determined by the juryâ€™s fact-finding role, their verdict was against Reddick and his driver, establishing that Longacre was entitled to damages. 

The appellant Reddick's liability was justified because the negligence of his driver, Abbott, while acting within the scope of his employment, was legally chargeable to Reddick. The principle of rescue applied, deeming that one who attempts to aid someone in imminent peril is not contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Longacre's actions were deemed neither rash nor imprudent.

The court opined that the failure to stop, failure to keep a proper lookout, and failure to keep the truck under control were prima facie negligent acts that contributed to Longacre's injuries. The court disregarded the argument that Longacre assumed the risk because he did not act rashly when attempting the rescue. Similarly, the court rejected the contention that an emergency situation absolved the defendants of their negligence.

The court also upheld the jury's determination that no new and independent cause, which could absolve the defendants of liability, was presented. The judgment in favor of the appellee Longacre for $20,000.00 was affirmed because the evidence supported the jury's findings, and it was clear that all acts of negligence committed by Abbott were chargeable to Reddick. There were no errors in the trial court's proceedings, and appellants' points were either overruled or found to be irrelevant to the outcome of the case.
