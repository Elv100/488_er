Background:

On April 25, 1997, McWilliams was driving home with his wife, son, and son's friend after a basketball game during a harsh winter storm. While attempting to return to the right-hand lane after passing Masterson's truck, McWilliams' vehicle struck cattle on the highway. Masterson's truck then collided with the rear of McWilliams' vehicle, resulting in the death of McWilliams' wife and injuries to other occupants.

McWilliams sued Masterson and his employers for negligence, and the trial court provided jury instructions on the theories of sudden emergency, unavoidable accident, and act of God. McWilliams objected, arguing that the inclusion of unavoidable accident was no longer permissible, the evidence did not support its submission, and there was no proof to support an act of God instruction.

The trial unfolded with evidence presenting conflicting conditions regarding the snowstorm and road status. Testimony revealed that the cattle, belonging to the Gabels, had escaped from well-maintained confines by trampling a gate. The incident was attributed to instinctive cattle behavior during the storm. Witnesses indicated that reasonable cattle owners would not expect, nor could they prevent, cattle escaping under such conditions.

Several experts provided differing conclusions about the possibility of Masterson avoiding the collision with McWilliams' vehicle after it struck the cattle. Furthermore, evidence suggested that the unusual late-season winter storm contributed directly and exclusively to the accident without human intervention.

Verdict:

Considering the evidence presented, it's probable that the court will uphold the decision to instruct the jury on both unavoidable accident and act of God. The evidence reveals that the accident could have occurred despite all parties exercising proper care. For unavoidable accident, the icy conditions, speed regulations, cattle escaping due to the storm, and collective non-negligent behavior of McWilliams and Masterson justify the jury instruction.

As for the act of God, the evidence suggests that the late and intense winter storm led directly to the cattle's escape and subsequent presence on the highway, an uncommon event that could not have been reasonably foreseen or prevented. The court will likely find that, while human elements were present, their involvement did not constitute negligence directly contributing to the accident.

In conclusion, the court will probably argue that, since evidence supported the submission of each instruction, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court, nor was there an unwarranted comment on the weight of the evidence. Therefore, the court will likely affirm the trial court's judgment of no liability, maintaining that both the unavoidable accident and act of God theories were applicable and correctly presented to the jury based on the case's facts.
