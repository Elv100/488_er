Background:
Angela N. Holder, formerly known as Angela N. Hamilton, pursued legal action after being sexually assaulted by a Houston police officer, Calvin Potter, in a garage owned by Mellon Mortgage Company ("Mellon") and monitored by the City of Houston ("the City"). The incident took place on November 8, 1992, when Officer Potter, while on duty and using a City squad car, stopped Holder for a purported traffic violation and instructed her to follow him to Mellon's garage. This garage was poorly lit, easily accessible, unattended, and unsecured at the time of the assault.

Holder filed suit against Mellon and the City on June 27, 1994. Against Mellon, she claimed negligence per se for violations of city ordinances (deeming the garage a "dangerous building") and common law negligence for failing to prevent a foreseeable injury by leaving the garage open and accessible. She alleged gross negligence and also asserted a loss of consortium claim on behalf of her minor child. Against the City, Holder alleged negligence in their supervision of Potter and his use of the City patrol car.

Mellon requested summary judgment arguing: 1) the City Ordinance was not applicable, 2) Mellon owed no legal duty to Holder as she was considered a trespasser, 3) the criminal conduct was unforeseeable, 4) Mellon's conduct was too remotely connected to establish causation, and 5) the submitted loss of consortium claim was invalid without alleging serious, permanent, and disabling injuries. The City claimed immunity from suit, stating Holder's claims did not fall within the TTCA’s limited waiver. The trial court granted Mellon's motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds, upheld Mellon's objection to the security expert affidavit provided by Holder, and approved the City’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

Verdict:
Regarding the City's appeal affirmation - the appellate court found that the City was immune from the lawsuit, stating the City's immunity was not waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act due to the criminal nature of the police officer's intentional tort. It will predict that Holder failed to allege an injury related to the use of property under the TTCA, emphasizing that Holder's injury was caused by an intentional assault rather than negligence related to the City's use of property. Thus, Holder's claims against the City for negligence in the supervision of Officer Potter and the misuse of the patrol car will be dismissed, as these claims pertain to an intentional tort committed by a government employee exempt under the TTCA.

Regarding Mellon's appeal - the court will reverse the summary judgment in favor of Mellon since the summary judgment proof included evidence that led to fact questions regarding foreseeability, negligence, and gross negligence. The court will find that there were prior violent crimes reported in the vicinity of Mellon's garage, which could establish foreseeability of criminal conduct. Furthermore, the testimony provided by Mellon employees about crime concerns and the admission that parking garages in Houston are susceptible to criminal activity will contribute to demonstrating a foreseeable risk. Thus, Mellon may have had a duty to take measures to prevent such risks.

The summary judgment on Mellon's liability for common law negligence will be reversed based on the evidence asserting: 1) the existence of a high crime area around Mellon's garage, 2) the inherent risk of criminal activity in unattended parking garages, and 3) the feasibility and low cost of securing the garage using something as simple as a chain. The court will use the rationale that Mellon's garage provided a unique opportunity for crime due to its condition during non-business hours, which may have contributed to the assault's occurrence. Additionally, due to Mellon's actual knowledge of crimes in the surrounding area and the concerns raised by employees, the court will find that Mellon may have been grossly negligent by not taking reasonable security precautions.

Regarding the loss of consortium claim for Holder's minor child, the court will reverse the summary judgment because Mellon failed to file special exceptions opposing the pleading's sufficiency regarding the seriousness of Holder's injuries. This error in granting summary judgment will be identified because courts need to provide an opportunity to correct pleading deficiencies before issuing such judgments.

Finally, the court will reverse the trial court's exclusion of Holder's expert security witness’s affidavit, finding that the objection by Mellon was not specific enough and thus deprived the court of substantial evidence on foreseeability.

Ultimately, the appellate court will direct attention to factual questions related to foreseeability, duty of care, and causation that are inappropriate for summary judgment and should instead be decided by a trial.
