**Background:**

Kevin D. Murray ("Murray") was involved in a collision on FM 181 while traveling as a front-seat passenger in a vehicle driven by James R. Seymour ("Seymour"). Prior to the incident, Martin A. Gomez, Jr. ("Gomez") had experienced sudden electrical failure in his Dodge Ram pickup truck with an attached trailer and had to pull onto the improved shoulder of the highway due to non-operational lightsâ€”it was night, and the area was dark. Timothy M. White ("White"), driving a Nabors Well Service vehicle (owned by his employer), stopped to offer assistance to Gomez. White parked his truck opposite to Gomez's, facing southbound, and suggested Gomez use a flashlight to signal traffic while they tried to jumpstart Gomez's truck. White's vehicle had flashers on, but he did not set up triangles.

As Seymour's vehicle approached the area where Gomez's vehicle was parked on the shoulder, Seymour's vehicle departed from the lane and onto the shoulder, colliding with Gomez's trailer. This collision caused Gomez's truck and trailer to be pushed into White's parked vehicle, which was propelled backward. After the accident, Gomez's trailer and the Nabors vehicle were partially on the roadway. Murray sued Seymour, Gomez, White, and Nabors for negligence and negligence per se for alleged violations of Texas Transportation Code Sections 545.301(a) and 545.303(a). A default judgment was entered against Gomez, Seymour had been dismissed from the case, and the trial court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of White and Nabors.

**Verdict:**

The judgment in favor of White and Nabors was affirmed. The court ruled that White did not owe a duty to warn Murray or the general public of the presence of Gomez's disabled vehicle on the roadway. Moreover, even if White had a duty to warn about his own vehicle being on the roadside, any failure to notify was immaterial since White's vehicle did not contribute to the collision or the resulting injuries to Murray. The dispute regarding whether the Nabors vehicle had flashers was deemed not a material fact because the Nabors vehicle didn't factor into the accident's occurrence.

Regarding negligence per se claims, the court found that Murray did not present sufficient evidence that White and Nabors violated Sections 545.301(a) and 545.303(a) of the Texas Transportation Code. Moreover, even if they had violated these statutes, there was no evidence that such violations were the proximate cause of Murray's injuries. As a consequence, White and Nabors were entitled to the summary judgment on the negligence per se claims as well.

In conclusion, White and Nabors did not have a duty to warn about the presence of Gomez's vehicle nor was there evidence that they breached any such duty with respect to their own vehicle. Furthermore, there were no material facts in dispute that could suggest Nabors and White were negligent or that they engaged in negligence per se by violating the traffic statutes in question. Therefore, the summary judgment in favor of Nabors and White was upheld by the appellate court.
