Background:
The case involves the estate of Eugene Johnson, represented by the appellant administratrix, who brought a negligence action against Johnson County after Eugene Johnson hung himself with a mattress cover in his cell at the county jail. The central legal issue pertains to whether the county could be held liable under the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code Section 101.021 for his death caused by a condition or use of property. The county asserted governmental immunity, which generally protects political subdivisions in Texas, including counties, from lawsuits unless there is an express waiver of such immunity. The key contention focused on whether the county's provision of a mattress cover to the decedent in his jail cell constituted "use" within the meaning of Section 101.021, which waives immunity for death caused by the use of property if a private person would be liable under similar circumstances.

The appellant attempted to distinguish this case from past precedents where governmental immunity was upheld by arguing that Johnson County did more than make the mattress cover available; it actively issued the bedding, locked Eugene Johnson in the cell and compelled him to use the mattress cover even though he was known to be suicidal. The appellant cited other precedents where liability was found when an entity provided insufficient protective measures (such as a hospital bed without side rails) or issued defective property that lacked safety features integral to protecting individuals known to be at risk. In contrast, Johnson County relied on precedents such as San Antonio State Hospital v. Cowan, where the hospital was not held liable for a patient's suicide using his own suspenders and walker, with the court determining that the hospital did not "use" the items within the meaning of Section 101.021.

Verdict:
Given the legal precedents and the statutory context, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment that Johnson County is protected by governmental immunity. The court will reason that the county cannot be held liable for Eugene Johnson's death because it did not engage in "use" of the mattress cover as contemplated by Section 101.021 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code. The county's act of providing a jail cell equipped with a mattress cover will be viewed as neither constituting a use of property by the county itself nor converting it into a private user. The court will conclude that merely allowing someone else (in this case, Eugene Johnson) to use the property does not meet the definition of "use" that would waive governmental immunity.

The decision will rely on the interpretation of past cases like Cowan and Texas A&M University v. Bishop, suggesting that a governmental unit does not "use" property merely by providing it to others. The appellant's arguments attempting to align this case with those that found liability when safety components were absent will not be persuasive. The court will determine that Johnson County did not take affirmative actions amounting to "use" in a manner proximately causing Eugene Johnson's death. Rather, the county's actions will be seen as analogous to the scenarios in Cowan and Bishop where "use" was narrowly construed, and immunity was not waived. The court will differentiate this case from those involving an entirely lacking integral safety component, indicating that the conditions do not fall within the "outer bounds" previously recognized for liability under similar statutes.
