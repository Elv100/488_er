Background:
W.W. Chandler, a citizen of Montague County of unsound mind, purchased a tract of land in 1907, which is traversed by Jones Creek. The Bowie Sewerage Company, a private corporation, constructed a sewage disposal plant in 1914 on a tract through which Jones Creek flows, about a mile or a mile and a half northeast of Chandler's property. The disposal plant served the town of Bowie, and the waste matter was treated in a system designed to dissolve refuse, which was then released into Jones Creek in September 1925. The creek flows onto Chandler's property approximately a mile from the discharge point. After the operation of the disposal plant, the creek on Chandler's property began to emit offensive odors and potentially harmful disease germs, causing discoloration and pollution of the creek bed. The overflow from the creek also damaged Chandler's land used for growing vegetables, adversely affecting his crops and the value of his land. A further claim was made regarding Chandler's wife's illness caused by the conditions created by the company.

Chandler's next friend filed suit on his behalf alleging the conditions constituted a nuisance, specifically a permanent one, and sought damages for the devaluation of Chandler's land and the illness suffered by Chandler's wife. During the trial, several demurrers, special exceptions, and pleas of limitations were overruled, and the jury was presented with 27 special issues to determine. The jury found in favor of Chandler on several points, including the establishment that the company's disposal plant discharge was the source of offensive odors and disease germs. They assessed the decline in the value of Chandler's property caused by the nuisances. However, the jury found against Chandler on issues relating to his wife's health and issued conflicting answers regarding the source of the disease germs. Chandler was awarded $1,470 in damages with an additional six percent interest from January 1, 1926. Following the trial, the company's motions for mistrial, refusal of judgment, and a new trial were all denied, leading to the company's appeal.

Verdict:
Upon reviewing the details provided in the appeal, the court will conclude that Chandler's pleadings and evidence illustrate only a temporary nuisance that could potentially be abated by the defendant, not a permanent nuisance. The judgment for damages will be considered incorrect because the measure of damages applied was based on the assumption of a permanent nuisance. The court will opine that Chandler needed to plead and prove that the company's disposal plant was unsuitable for its intended purpose or negligently operated, which was not sufficiently demonstrated.

Furthermore, the court will take judicial notice of the disposal plant's intent, which was to treat sewage and prevent it from being a nuisance. Since the burden is on Chandler to prove it is a nuisance, and the proof presented falls short, the court will not sustain the trial court’s judgment on this ground.

The court will also find fault with the lay testimony accepted regarding Chandler's mental capacity, stating that a witness can only testify about the person's mental state after establishing qualification through fact-based observations. Additionally, the court will identify inconsistencies in the jury's findings, which should preclude judgment being based on the given verdict, and will disapprove of the trial court awarding damages with interest from a prior date, as it is not an established practice.

Moreover, the court will take issue with the submission of certain special issues to the jury, particularly regarding the necessity of expert testimony to establish the presence of disease germs and the failure to define the term "materially offensive."

Based on these considerations, the court will reverse the judgment from the trial court and remand the cause, meaning the case will be sent back to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court’s findings.
