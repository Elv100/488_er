Background:
The appellant, an injured party, sought review after a previous judgment from the 11th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, was not in his favor regarding his personal injury claim against the appellee cab company. The appellant had sustained injuries when an employee of the appellee cab company shot him following a traffic altercation. The crux of the appellant's argument centered around the claim that the appellee was liable for the negligence of its employee who was carrying a weapon during the altercation. The appellant contended that, due to the appellee's policies and regulatory control over drivers, the company should've been aware or should have reasonably foreseen that its employees could carry weapons, thus contributing to a dangerous environment. 

Specifically, the company did not forbid drivers from carrying guns nor inform them about procedures during traffic incidents. Evidence from the trial highlighted that cab drivers commonly carry guns, and there was at least one prior instance where a cab driver killed a man following a traffic incident. Additionally, a police officer testified to the commonality of armed cab drivers in Houston; the company's claims manager found a gun in a cab previously; and the president had admitted to a conscious decision not to ask its drivers about carrying guns. This was against a backdrop of frequent traffic accidents in Houston, which sometimes escalated to assaults and even murder, increasing the risk of shootings when drivers were armed. The trial acknowledged the negligence of the cab company, the driver (McIntyre), and the appellant, with the jury assigning causation percentages of sixteen percent, forty-two percent, and forty-two percent respectively to each, and damages of $3,077,500.00 to the appellant.

However, the trial court disregarded the jury's findings regarding the operation of the cab during the shooting and ruled as a matter of law that the cab company's negligence could not be a proximate cause of the appellant's injuries due to the shooting being an intentional act. This take-nothing judgment dismissed the appellant's claims against the cab company while allowing for recovery from the individual, McIntyre. The appellant's appeal challenged this ruling, particularly that the city code section 46-17 implying vicarious liability was misinterpreted, and that the appellee's negligence should be recognized as a proximate cause of his injuries.

Verdict:
The court will find that the evidence presented does indicate negligence on the part of the appellee cab company and that this negligence was a proximate cause of the appellant's injuries, contrary to the trial court's decision to grant a take-nothing judgment. The evidence will likely lead to a reversal of the trial court's judgment because it showcases a duty of care owed by the cab company that was breached due to foreseeable risk.

The court will determine that the appellant has established components of negligence: the appellee owed a duty, breached said duty, and as a result, damages were proximately caused to the appellant. It will be reasoned that the foreseeable risk of injury was high due to the company's failure to address the potential danger of its drivers carrying guns, combined with the commonality of violent outcomes stemming from traffic incidents. The frequency of aggressive encounters involving cab drivers and the knowledge that some drivers carried weapons will solidify the foreseeability factor of the risk, thus satisfying the duty component of negligence.

The verdict will likely articulate that the intentional nature of McIntyre’s act (the shooting) does not relieve the cab company of responsibility for creating a situation in which such an act could foreseeably occur. Evidence of prior similar incidents will reinforce the claim that the negligent act—a refusal to regulate or address the carrying of guns by drivers—was a substantial factor in precipitating the appellant’s injuries. 

In conclusion, the court will predict that such evidence supports findings of negligence and proximate cause and that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's answers. The court will likely order a reversal of the take-nothing judgment and render judgment in favor of the appellant, awarding him recovery from the appellee commensurate with the degree to which the appellee's negligence contributed to his injury. This reasoning will rest on the evidence and applicable law supporting a finding that the cab company negligently facilitated a foreseeable danger which led to the appellant's injuries.
