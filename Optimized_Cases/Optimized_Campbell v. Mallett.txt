Background:
Terry Campbell, the appellant, initiated a malpractice action against his former criminal defense attorney, Edward A. Mallett, the appellee. Campbell claimed that due to Mallett's negligence in preparing his defense, he was coerced into pleading guilty to federal procurement fraud and obstruction of justice. In response to these malpractice claims, Mallett filed a motion for summary judgment.

Prior to the malpractice suit, Campbell, his sister, a business associate, and two of Campbell's corporations were indicted on several counts related to federal procurement fraud and obstruction of justice. As part of a plea agreement, which entailed the dismissal of most charges and a lighter application of the sentencing guidelines, Campbell pled guilty to one count of fraud and one count of obstruction. Campbell was then sentenced to five years in prison. In his malpractice suit, he alleged he was coerced into this guilty plea and accused Mallett of breach of warranty under the DTPA, violation of disciplinary rules, and sought damages for himself and his family.

The court granted partial summary judgment in Mallett’s favor regarding all parties and causes of action, except for Campbell’s claim of negligence. This remaining negligence claim was also later granted summary judgment in Mallett's favor. Campbell appealed this decision, asserting that Mallett’s motion wasn’t well-founded. The appeal court's established review process required the movant for summary judgment to demonstrate an absence of any material fact issue and an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, taking all evidence favorably towards the non-movant, which in this case, was Campbell.

During the criminal proceeding, Campbell had confirmed under oath to the judge that he pled guilty freely and voluntarily and that he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation. Based on the testimony, Campbell admitted to the criminal conduct he was accused of. This testimony was used as evidence to support Mallett's motion for summary judgment. In response, Campbell provided a transcript from a hearing on his unsuccessful motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and an affidavit asserting that Mallett admitted to little trial preparation, alongside urging Campbell to plead guilty.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the summary judgment granted in favor of Mallett. The verdict will be supported by the reasoning that Mallett, as the movant, successfully demonstrated an absence of one essential element of Campbell's malpractice claim. In legal malpractice actions, Campbell would have needed to establish that he had a meritorious defense and that, but for Mallett's purported negligence, he could have proven this defense leading to a different outcome at trial. Campbell's sworn testimony during the criminal proceeding, wherein he admitted his guilt and expressed satisfaction with his counsel, would irreparably undermine his negligence claim. Furthermore, the court will note that this admission implies Campbell cannot establish that Mallett's actions were the proximate cause of his conviction; rather, it was his own criminal conduct.

The evidence that Campbell presented in his appeal, including the attempt to withdraw his guilty plea and the purported lack of trial preparation by Mallett, would fail to raise a material fact issue regarding the proximate cause of Campbell's damages. The affidavits and testimony submitted by Campbell would support the judgment and fall short in demonstrating that any negligence on Mallett’s part led to Campbell's plea. Campbell would be judicially estopped from asserting coercion in his guilty plea because of his prior contradictory oath. The court will find no issues with the reliance on Tijerina v. Wennermark, as the essential reasoning from this prior case — that the admitted guilt of a crime by a defendant without coercion establishes a lack of merit in defense and precludes malpractice claims — would apply to Campbell's case. As a result, Campbell would have failed to meet the shifted burden of establishing the existence of a material fact question by not demonstrating any proof of his innocence or defense against the accusations.

In sum, the court's affirmation of the summary judgment would rest on Campbell's failure to prove Mallett's negligence proximately caused his damages, the absence of a meritorious defense, and the fact that Campbell admitted guilt under oath and cannot claim a forced plea.
