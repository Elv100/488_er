Background:
On August 16, 2001, James Hicks joined an offshore fishing trip on the M/V LADY ANNA, owned and operated by Captain Elliott's Party Boats, Inc., along with his brother-in-law, Kenneth Carter, and his friend, Benjamin T. Smith. Captain Steven Odstrcil and two other crew members were operating the vessel that day. The trip left Freeport, Texas at 6:00 a.m. By 10:45 a.m., Hicks became ill, showing symptoms including vomiting, sweating, weakness, and a pale complexion. Initially, the crew thought Hicks was seasick and did not provide immediate extensive care. His condition deteriorated, and by 11:45 a.m. he was incoherent and lacked a heartbeat. CPR was administered by a crew member and passenger. Captain Odstrcil contacted the U.S. Coast Guard, and Hicks was airlifted, but he was pronounced dead upon arrival at a medical facility. His death was due to a heart attack caused by cardiovascular disease.

Sheila Hicks, James's wife, filed a wrongful death and survival action against Captain Elliott's Party Boats, alleging negligence in failing to provide care, respond appropriately to James's condition, and provide medical treatment. The company filed for both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, citing DOSHA preemption and asserting Sheila presented no evidence of negligence. On January 21, 2005, the motions were filed and on March 28, 2005, the summary judgment was granted in favor of Captain Elliott's Party Boats. Sheila then filed a motion for a new trial, which was also denied.

In appeal, Sheila contended that she presented evidence addressing all negligence claim elements. She submitted affidavits from Smith and Captain Richard L. Frenzel, highlighting the inadequacy of the crew's response and breach of care standards. Dr. George Burnazian's affidavit suggested that the crew's earlier intervention could have greatly increased Hicks's survival chances. However, this fell short of establishing a causal link between the actions of Captain Elliott’s crew and Hicks's death. Dr. Burnazian filed a supplemental affidavit with Sheila's motion for a new trial, postulating that the crew's failure to render aid was likely a significant factor in Hicks's death.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision to grant a no-evidence summary judgment in favor of Captain Elliott's Party Boats. The court will reason that Sheila did not provide sufficient evidence to raise a material fact issue regarding proximate cause, focusing on the test for cause-in-fact, which requires the circumstance that the act or omission was a substantial factor in causing the injury that would not have occurred otherwise. Despite the affidavits submitted by Sheila, she will be seen as failing to present more than a scintilla of evidence that Captain Elliott’s actions or inactions were the cause-in-fact of her husband's death. This deficiency will be crucial as it undermines her ability to establish the proximate cause element of her negligence claim.

Regarding the trial court's denial of Sheila's motion for a new trial, the appellate court will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion since Dr. Burnazian’s supplemental affidavit, filed with the motion, was not presented at the time the trial court granted summary judgment, thus it could not have been considered. The court will determine that evidence presented post-summary judgment cannot factor into the appeal and that Sheila's third issue regarding the denial of the motion for a new trial will also be overruled. The reasoning will focus on the procedural aspect that the record as it stood at the time of the summary judgment ruling is the basis for review, and additional evidence introduced later cannot be considered. The final verdict will be guided by examining the sufficiency of cause-in-fact and foreseeability without delving into post-judgment submissions.
