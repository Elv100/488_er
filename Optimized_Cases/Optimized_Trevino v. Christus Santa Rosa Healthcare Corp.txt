Background:
On August 21, 1997, Pearl Trevino, who was pregnant with her first child, woke up in the middle of the night experiencing symptoms that led her to believe she was going into labor. She was experiencing vaginal bleeding, frequent urination, and a lot of pain. Her mother drove her to Santa Rosa Hospital and registered her in the emergency room. While waiting, Trevino made several trips to the restroom. During her last trip, she yelled from the stall that she was in a lot of pain and that something was coming out. Trevino's mother informed Nurse Nichola Harlan of her daughter's condition, and Harlan replied that she would be there soon. A security guard, who had previously helped Trevino, went to check on her and upon seeing that the baby was coming out, alerted Harlan. Harlan proceeded to the restroom, saw the baby's head, asked the security guard to call for help, and assisted with the delivery. The baby was transported to the neonatal intensive care unit. Trevino was asked to walk from the restroom to a bed since the hospital bed could not fit through the restroom door, using a sheet to hold the umbilical cord, placenta, and fluids, while being half-naked and observed by a crowd that applauded her.

Trevino sued Santa Rosa Hospital and Harlan for intentional infliction of emotional distress, common law fraud, violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and medical malpractice. At trial, directed verdicts were granted in favor of the defendants on all claims, which Trevino appealed. Regarding the emotional distress claim, the court held that Trevino did not show she suffered severe emotional distress. As for common law fraud, it was deemed that the nurse did not know her statement was false when made. Trevino did not establish that the hospital fully billed her for the infantâ€™s labor and delivery to sustain the DTPA claims. Finally, due to her failure to offer expert testimony on proximate cause, her medical malpractice claim was also dismissed.

Verdict:
The appeals court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. As to the intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if Trevino could establish reckless conduct by the appellees, there was no evidence that she suffered severe emotional distress. In defining severe emotional distress, she needed to demonstrate that it was more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger, which she did not do. On the common law fraud claim, Trevino did not show that when the nurse made the statement about being there soon, she knew it to be false. For the DTPA claims, Trevino was unable to prove that the hospital's actions were unconscionable or that full billing took place without evidence of the hospital bill in the record. Additionally, the term "goods" in the DTPA did not apply to services offered to Trevino. Concerning the medical malpractice claim, Trevino was unable to establish the necessary proximate cause between the medical care received and the pain endured as she did not present expert testimony. Since she couldn't show with a reasonable medical probability that earlier triaging would have prevented her pain, expert testimony was crucial to her medical malpractice claim. The court emphasized that a plaintiff's failure to provide evidence on the element of proximate cause is fatal to maintaining a medical malpractice claim. Thus, the directed verdict was upheld, and the defendants prevailed on all claims raised by Trevino.
