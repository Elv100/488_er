Background:
The City of Athens, Texas, operates a water treatment plant near Lake Athens. The plant sits at the top of a hill, sloping towards the lake, from which raw water is drawn for processing. Directly downhill from the plant near the shoreline of Lake Athens live the Residents—the Runnings and Cindy Wilkins—who brought claims against the City and the Athens Municipal Water Authority (AMWA), asserting that releases of water from the plant's Clearwell No. 2 caused flooding that damaged their homes and properties in May 2015, December 2015, and March 2016.

The Residents filed negligence claims under the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA), state and federal inverse condemnation claims, and alleged violations of the Texas Water Code. The trial court dismissed the Texas Water Code violations and all the claims against AMWA but denied the City's plea to the jurisdiction regarding the negligence and inverse condemnation claims. The City filed a cross-appeal challenging the trial court's order on the grounds of governmental immunity.

As part of the negligence claim under the TTCA, the Residents alleged that the plant's equipment—specifically motor-driven equipment like pumps, valves, and monitoring equipment—was negligently operated or maintained by City employees, leading to the flooding. They submitted that the Clearwell No. 2 check valve became stuck in an open position, causing backflow, and that water pumped from the lake to the plant filters, combined with operator's failure to switch the filters from automatic to manual during a power surge, contributed to the overflow.

In the inverse condemnation claim under the Texas Constitution, the Residents argued that the government knowingly performed acts that caused their property to be damaged for public use, suggesting the City had a longstanding practice of releasing water when Clearwell No. 2 became too full. They also filed a similar federal takings claim under the U.S. Constitution's Just Compensation Clause.

Verdict:
The Residents' expert testimony regarding the cause of the overflow from the water filters provided only a scintilla of evidence—largely based on speculation—and failed to prove that the City's operation of the equipment was the actual cause of the flooding. Therefore, the Trial Court's ruling granting waiver immunity under the TTCA was reversed, as the testimony did not provide a link between the use or operation of motor-driven equipment and the damages suffered by the Residents.

For the inverse condemnation claim under the Texas Constitution, there was no evidence showing that the government knew or was substantially certain that flooding would result from the discharge of water. Claims of intentional releases in the past and conversations with City representatives did not evidence a substantial certainty of harm or demonstrate that the flooding was a necessary result of the City's actions. Hence, based on these facts, the Residents could not establish a viable claim for inverse condemnation under the Texas Constitution, and the City's challenge to jurisdiction was likely to be upheld.

Regarding the federal takings claim, it was contingent on the viability of the state inverse condemnation claim. Since the state claim was deemed nonviable, the federal claim as well was subsumed within it and thus could not stand on its own. The Residents' federal takings claim was likely to be dismissed due to the lack of a viable state claim, confirming the City's assertion in its plea to jurisdiction.

In conclusion, the higher court was poised to reverse the trial court’s denial of the City’s plea to jurisdiction across all counts, concluding that the Residents failed to provide sufficient evidence to waive the City's governmental immunity. The Residents' claims were likely to be dismissed on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and all costs would probably be adjudged against the Residents.
