Background: Willie J. Hardy, owner of Sunset Valley Mobile Home Park, had employed John Smith as a maintenance man since September 2015. John, like other residents, also lived at the park. Tasha Ernest Douglas, along with her husband Francisco "Frank" Douglas and other family members, were tenants at the park. Tasha fell behind on rent, and on December 8, 2015, an eviction notice was issued. Subsequent meetings to resolve the rent issue between Hardy, Tasha, Frank, and John led to an agreement for Tasha to vacate by December 16, although due to Tasha's hospitalization, moving out was delayed.

On December 18, 2015, Tasha finished moving out and told John that Frank had the keys. After Frank returned from work, he and Tasha went to return the keys to John. John had been drinking since early in the day. A confrontation occurred in which John, angered by their presence, shot and killed Frank. John Smith was later convicted of Frank's murder in a criminal trial. Tasha and others filed a civil suit against Hardy, claiming negligent hiring, training, supervision, and retention, as well as wrongful death and survival claims based on negligence and premises liability theories, seeking exemplary damages.

Hardy filed for summary judgment, stating that there was no evidence of proximate causation on the plaintiffs' claims and that John's criminal act of murder was not foreseeable. The trial court granted the summary judgment, which was appealed by the appellants. The appellants claimed that Hardy had failed to sufficiently identify the essential element he challenged, contesting the summary judgment's appropriateness.

Verdict: The trial court's summary judgment in favor of Hardy was affirmed. It was determined that at the time of John's previous discriminatory statements in September 2015, it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would commit murder months later during a disagreement over the return of keys. Imposing a duty on Hardy in these circumstances would make the employer an insurer against highly unpredictable events and would impose too great a burden on the employer-employee relationship. There was no evidence that Hardy's actions as a landowner caused the tenants' damages under their claims. No special duties were given to John that involved carrying a firearm or performing security, and there was no evidence Hardy knew of John's firearm. Thus, Hardy's hiring and supervision of John were not proximate causes of the incident, nor were John's later unforeseeable actions foreseeable based on his job.

Moreover, no duty by Hardy was established since there was no evidence of recent, similar crimes near the mobile home park that would have made future crimes foreseeable. Hardy was also not present during the altercation and had no direct knowledge of an imminent confrontation. John's previous comments did not amount to imminent conflict knowledge for Hardy. Thus, Hardy owed no general duty to the appellants as invitees to inspect, warn, or prevent against the dangers associated with John's individual actions.

Evidentiary complaints raised by the appellants were also dismissed, as Hardy's burden was not to establish entitlement to the summary judgment but rather the appellants' burden to produce evidence to create a factual issue. Even without Hardy's affidavit, the appellants failed to show Hardy owed a legal duty or that proximate cause was established between Hardy's actions and the criminal conduct resulting in Frank's death. Therefore, all appellants' issues were overruled, and the trial court's decision was upheld.
