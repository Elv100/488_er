Background:
Appellant insurer initiated a case seeking to overturn an award made by the Texas Industrial Accident Board granted to appellees, a wife and child of a deceased worker. The decedent was employed by the Gulf Refining Company at a gas plant in Port Arthur, Texas. On October 26, 1922, an accident occurred at the plant, resulting in the decedent inhaling chlorine gas after machinery malfunctioned. He was hospitalized for over two days and then sent home. Weeks later, he was diagnosed with double lobar pneumonia and subsequently died on December 2. The wife and child filed for compensation from the Industrial Accident Board, which awarded them $15 per week for 360 weeks. The insurer disputed the claim on the basis that the decedent's death was not the result of an "injury" received in the course of employment, according to the definition in the Workmen's Compensation Act of Texas.

Evidence showed the decedent's significant exposure to chlorine gas leading to his immediate and prolonged medical symptoms, including coughing and spitting blood. Testimony also indicated his weakened condition post-hospitalization and continued work despite his health issues. Although the insurer presented opinions from physicians that pneumonia was not related to chlorine gas inhalation, there was evidence, including expert testimony, suggesting that the injury to the lungs from the gas could naturally result in pneumonia.

During the trial, the jury's special issues verdict led to a judgment in favor of the wife and minor child, awarding half of the compensation to each, with the minor's share to be redeemed in a lump sum calculated at $2,240.11. The insurer appealed, arguing multiple points including that the disease of lobar pneumonia could not naturally result from chlorine gas inhalation, and that the court erred in not directing a verdict in its favor. They also challenged the adequacy of the minor's pleadings, the evidence, and the structure of the judgment in favor of both appellees.

Verdict:
In predicting the verdict, the court will uphold the district court's judgment based on the interpretation of the Workmen's Compensation Act and the broad definition of "injury" or "personal injury" within it. It will note that the requirement for an injury to be compensable is not that the disease must usually and ordinarily result from such an injury but that the disease naturally resulted from the accident considering human anatomy and common experiences. The verdict will be guided by the legislature's intent and the act's provisions, emphasizing that injuries received in the course of employment should be compensated, and restricting its interpretation to not require the element of proximate cause typically needed in actionable negligence.

Furthermore, the court will find the evidence presented at trial sufficient for a jury to conclude that inhalation of chlorine gas was the exciting and efficient cause of Smith's death from pneumonia. Therefore, the verdict will acknowledge that the act does not necessitate the disease to be a typical result of the injury, but that it must naturally follow the injury considering the facts of the case.

Additionally, the court will reject the appellant's argument regarding the structure of the compensation judgment, as it will recognize the court's discretion in awarding a lump sum to one beneficiary while providing weekly payments to another, considering their different circumstances. The court will detail that there is no legislative or judicial precedent prohibiting such a judgment structure and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in meeting the minor's specific needs through a lump sum payment.

In conclusion, the detailed reasons for affirming the district court's judgment will include the act's intent, the sufficient evidence connecting Smith's death to his work injury, and the discretionary nature of the award structure given the beneficiaries' disparate situations. The insurer's contentions will not overturn the award, and the verdict for the wife and minor child will stand as initially rendered.
