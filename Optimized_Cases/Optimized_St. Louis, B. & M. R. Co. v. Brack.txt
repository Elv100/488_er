Background:
The fatal collision occurred late at night on November 18, 1932, when decedent O. M. Brack drove his car into a freight train of the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway Company, which had been left standing across McColl road, a paved public road in Texas. The train, moving from west to east, was stalled as its crew was engaged in operations on a switch or siding to the east. A low, dark-colored oil tank car was left standing across the road's paved portion, flanked on both sides by large, light-colored box cars. This positioning made it challenging to see the oil tank car until one was very close. Two eyewitnesses, Scroggins and Dean, who were waiting at the crossing before the collision, testified they had also mistakenly believed the crossing was clear until they came close to the obscured oil tank car.

Brack approached the crossing believing it to be open, but collided with the oil tank car and was fatally injured. The jury found that at the time of the collision, the railway company had unlawfully blocked the road crossing for more than five minutes, contrary to Texas statutes, and without posting any guards, watchmen, or visible signals, which was negligent and a proximate cause of the collision and death. They also found that Brack was not guilty of contributory negligence.

The railway company appealed, seeking a motion to stay proceedings based on pending bankruptcy proceedings and contended that the plaintiff's evidence showed contributory negligence by the deceased as a matter of law.

Verdict:
Upon review, the key factor for determining the outcome of the case revolves around the legal concept of proximate cause. While the trial court and jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, noting negligence on the part of the railroad company due to the unlawful and prolonged blocking of the road without necessary warnings and the absence of contributory negligence on the part of Brack, the appellate court will focus on the proper legal definition of proximate cause as used at trial.

The appellate court will scrutinize the jury's conclusion that the blocking of the crossing was a proximate cause of the injury and determine if the definition of proximate cause instructed to the jury was correct. The crux of the appellate court's reasoning will hinge on whether the element of foreseeability was adequately included in the given definition.

Given that the proper and universally accepted definition of proximate cause in personal injury actions includes foreseeability — the concept that the injury should have been reasonably anticipated under the given circumstances — the appellate court will likely find that omitting this element is a reversible error. The trial court's definition did not explicitly involve foreseeability, a mistake that potentially rendered the jury's decision flawed.

Therefore, the appellate court will predictably reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the basis that the original trial court's instruction to the jury omitted the foreseeability element in the definition of proximate cause, which is tantamount to reversible error in personal injury actions. The ultimate resolution will require the trial court to use the correct legal definition and consider foreseeability as an essential component of proximate cause. Additionally, some members of the appellate court express uncertainty over the findings related to contributory negligence and wilful blocking of the highway by the defendant, but those issues will remain open for reconsideration in the new trial.
