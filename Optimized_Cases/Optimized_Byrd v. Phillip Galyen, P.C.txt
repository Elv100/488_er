Background:
Philip Gregory Byrd retained Bourland, Wall & Wenzel, P.C. (Bourland), to form PGB Air, Inc. (PGB) and to convert Lucy Leasing Co., LLC (Lucy Leasing) to be owned solely by him. In April 2006, he hired Jerry Buckner for a divorce action against his wife, Nancy Ann Simenstad, which in December 2006 was taken over by Phillip Galyen, P.C., d/b/a/ Bailey & Galyen Attorneys at Law (Bailey & Galyen). Simenstad served discovery requests that Byrd failed to comply with. Bailey & Galyen did not properly attend to or file responses to the discovery requests. This led to the court enforcing a discovery order, ordering Byrd to provide the requested information and to appear in court to consider sanctions for noncompliance. The trial court eventually held Byrd in contempt for failing to comply, imposed a fine, and committed him to jail for thirty days. Bailey & Galyen filed an appeal and petition for habeas corpus on behalf of Byrd, both of which were unsuccessful. Over time, PGB and Lucy Leasing were also included in the divorce action.

The appellants (Byrd, Lucy Leasing, and PGB) filed a legal malpractice suit against Bailey & Galyen, alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The trial court granted Appellees' no-evidence motion for summary judgment concerning Byrd's claims for legal malpractice arising from the contempt order, adhering to the sole-proximate-cause bar since Byrd hadn't been exonerated. The appellants appealed the summary judgment.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision to grant the Appelleesâ€™ partial summary judgment. It will be determined that the remedial-contempt order issued to enforce the prior discovery order in a divorce action is not equivalent to a criminal conviction. Therefore, the sole-proximate-cause bar, which typically applies to legal malpractice claims in the context of criminal convictions, does not apply to civil remedial-contempt orders. The court will look at the policies underpinning the sole-proximate-cause bar and note that they are not fitting in a civil context due to the impossibility of exoneration in such cases, the lack of criminal defendant protections, and having civil jurisdiction over habeas corpus related to the order.

Additionally, Lucy Leasing and PGB were not parties to the remedial-contempt order and did not engage in the noncompliant activities. As such, they cannot be considered having engaged in any "illegal acts" that led to the contempt order and consequently cannot be barred from their claims under the sole-proximate-cause standard. The appellate court will thus conclude that Byrd's negligence claims, as well as the claims of Lucy Leasing and PGB, that arise out of the actions leading to the civil remedial-contempt order are not barred by the sole-proximate-cause bar. The case will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to address these claims.
