Background:
The child, her mother, and her aunt resided in a house situated along the railway line belonging to the appellant railway company. On the day of the incident, the mother informed her sister (the child's aunt) that a train was approaching and instructed her to look after the child while she went to wash at a nearby branch, which was about 200 yards from their house and a step from the railroad. Upon the mother's departure, the aunt placed the child on the kitchen floor as she proceeded to wash dishes.

Subsequently, the railway company's fireman discovered the child with its arm severed by the train and brought the child into the house. Both the railway company's engineer and fireman testified that they did not spot the child on the track early enough to halt the train. The railway company requested the trial court to instruct the jury it owed no duty to persons on its tracks, but the request was denied. The jury sided with the child, awarding her $8,000 in damages for personal injuries stemming from the railway company's alleged negligence.

The railway company presented several legal arguments to refute its liability, emphasizing the exclusivity of its ownership and control over the tracks, the improbability of foreseeing children on the tracks, and a limitation on their duty to ordinary care in exercising vigilance for individuals on the tracks not at crossings. Furthermore, they argued that no presumption of negligence should be attached simply due to the presence of an injured party on the tracks. The company also raised issues with the jury instructions concerning the mother's care for the child, given her social and economic situation, as well as with the definition of "proximate cause." They criticized the final damages awarded as excessive and unwarranted by the evidence presented. 

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's judgment, relying on the fact that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer negligence on the part of the railway company's employees. The verdict will be supported despite acknowledging the railway company's contention that the railway is not ordinarily expected to anticipate unauthorized individuals, including children, on its tracks.

The reasoning will be that while the railway company has no obligation to expect trespassers between designated crossings, it does owe a duty of ordinary care to avoid injury to others, including in cases involving infant trespassers—such a duty involves maintaining a proper watch. Therefore, the court will determine that there was testimony, both direct and circumstantial, which allowed the jury to conclude that the railway company's employees may have lacked proper watchfulness, thus failing to spot the child in time.

The court will also consider the consistency of witness statements and physical evidence indicating that the train personnel could have seen the child on the track had they been properly attentive. Given that the jury's verdict is being affirmed by the district judge who presided over and heard all the testimonies and evidence during the trial, the court will likely conclude that the jury's decision wasn’t "clearly wrong."

As for the amount of damages awarded, the court will hold it as reasonable given the severe and permanent nature of the child’s injuries (loss of an arm). The court will elaborate that the jury is entitled to consider the probable impact on the child’s health, ability to use the limb, and future earning capacity. That the judgment doesn't reflect an oversight in the damages awarded and the instructions provided during the trial for determining them will also be discussed.

Lastly, the possibility of contributory negligence by the mother or the child's aunt will not significantly alter the outcome since the verdict had already taken into consideration the negligence claim against the child's caretakers. However, the court will note that the case details did not necessitate addressing the broader legal question of whether a mother's negligence can be imputed to her child. The court will assert that since the appellant railway company benefited from jury instructions regarding contributory negligence as far as they requested, they cannot claim harm from not getting a further instruction specifically about the aunt's potential negligence.
