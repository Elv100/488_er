Background:
Constance Christie, the appellant patient, sued doctors Jim Gilmore, M.D. and Sue Ellen Cox, M.D., claiming medical malpractice, failure to obtain informed consent, and gross negligence following facial plastic surgery. Dr. Cox filed a "no evidence" motion for summary judgment, maintaining she was not negligent and had no duty to obtain informed consent as Christie was not her patient. Later, Dr. Gilmore also filed a "no evidence" motion, contending Christie couldn't raise a material issue of fact regarding allegations against him. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of both Dr. Cox and Dr. Gilmore without specifying reasons.

The appeal focused on whether Christie provided enough evidence to establish the breach of standard care and proximate cause for her claims. It was determined that Christie failed to raise a material fact issue regarding standard of care and proximate cause for her claims against Dr. Cox. Specifically, Christie did not present expert testimony elucidating the standard of care Dr. Cox allegedly breached or how any such breach proximately caused her damages.

Similarly, concerning Dr. Gilmore's actions, Christie did not establish a standard of care through expert testimony, a necessary component to assert medical negligence. Furthermore, her claims of Gilmore's gross negligence regarding purported medical record alterations and allowing an untrained colleague to participate in the surgery lacked evidentiary support.

However, Christie did raise a material fact issue regarding the informed consent claim against Dr. Gilmore. She provided testimony that she signed a blank consent form under pressure from Gilmore's nurses who misrepresented the form as "informal" rather than "informed" consent. Christie alleged she was not aware of all the procedures performed nor the risks involved, and she stated she would not have consented to the surgery had she been fully informed of the risks. Additionally, testimony was provided that Christie suffered from asymmetry and heavy scarring following the surgery â€“ risks she was not informed about.

Verdict:
The judgment will be affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The decision will favor Dr. Cox entirely, and she will prevail on all claims against her because Christie failed to produce evidence of negligence or informed consent issues related to Dr. Cox. 

However, the verdict will be different for Dr. Gilmore. While the judgment will be affirmed regarding Christie's claims of medical malpractice and gross negligence, since she was unable to establish a standard of care through expert testimony and there was no evidence of gross negligence, the judgment will be reversed with respect to the informed consent claim. This reversal is because Christie raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether informed consent was properly obtained by Dr. Gilmore. She demonstrated through testimony that she was pressured to sign the consent form without being fully informed of the procedures and risks, which is a breach of the standard care for informed consent. Christie's claims show that a reasonable person might refuse treatment if fully informed, and she alleged injuries as a result of risks she was not made aware of. The informed consent claim will be remanded for a trial to determine if the lack of informed consent led to Christie's injuries.
