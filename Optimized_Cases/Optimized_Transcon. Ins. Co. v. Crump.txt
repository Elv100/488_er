Background: Charles Crump had received a kidney transplant in 1975 and was under a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressant drug therapy. In May 2000, while working for Frito-Lay, he sustained a knee injury resulting in a contusion and a hematoma. Following a series of health complications requiring hospitalizations, Crump died in January 2001. His wife, Joyce Crump, applied for workers' compensation death benefits, alleging the knee injury was a producing cause of his death. After administrative proceedings concluded in favor of Joyce Crump, the insurance carrier, Transcontinental Insurance Company, sought judicial review. During the trial, Transcontinental contended the May 2000 injury was not a producing cause of Crump's death. Their expert, Dr. Judson Hunt, testified that Crump's existing immunosuppressed state and health conditions, independent of his work injury, caused his death. Conversely, Dr. John Daller, Crump's treating physician, testified that the work injury was a producing cause of Crump's death, stating the injury led to an infection which compounded Crump's existing health issues, causing organ failure and death. Ultimately, the jury found the knee injury was a producing cause of death and awarded attorney's fees to Joyce Crump. Transcontinental appealed, arguing Daller's testimony was unreliable for being based on differential diagnosis, objecting to the definition of "producing cause" the jury was given, and disputing the manner in which attorney's fees were determined. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision, and Transcontinental then sought further review.

Verdict: The Texas Supreme Court held that there were three key errors with the trial court’s proceedings. Firstly, the expert medical causation testimony from Dr. Daller, Crump's treating physician, was considered legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict since his use of differential diagnosis was deemed a reliable foundation for his testimony. This would affirm his testimony's credibility and thus sustain the finding that the jury could have reasonably believed that the knee injury was a producing cause of his death. Secondly, the Court found it was reversible error for the jury to be instructed without a 'but-for' component included in the definition of "producing cause." Predictively, the Supreme Court will likely conclude that the term "producing cause" should be defined accurately as a substantial factor in bringing about an injury or death and without which the death would not have occurred. The Court will emphasize that the omission of the but-for component was harmful because it led the jury to potentially render an incorrect verdict on the sole issue of causation. Therefore, the Supreme Court will hold that this charge error warrants a new trial. Thirdly, the Texas Supreme Court will determine that when a factual dispute exists regarding reasonable and necessary attorney's fees under Texas Labor Code § 408.221(c), an insurance carrier has the right to have a jury trial on the contested amount. In this case, Transcontinental Insurance Company will have the right to a jury trial on the amount of attorney's fees because those fees were in dispute. This means the manner in which attorney's fees were determined was improvidently done by the trial court as the decision should have been reserved for a jury's determination. 

In conclusion, the Texas Supreme Court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial, in light of the erroneous jury instruction regarding "producing cause" and the misplaced determination of attorney's fees without utilizing a jury for that factual dispute. The sustaining of Dr. Daller’s testimony, while leaving room for a different result on retrial, nonetheless will uphold the legal sufficiency of his causation evidence in accordance with existing legal standards for expert testimony.
