Background:
Appellee Robert Barrera, an employee of Tri-State Wholesale Associated Grocers, Inc. (appellant employer), suffered injuries resulting from a workplace accident. On August 15, 1990, another Tri-State employee, Louis Calderon, while operating a forklift in the freezer section of Warehouse B, lost control of the vehicle on an accumulated sheet of ice and became trapped after crashing into merchandise racks. Barrera, hearing Calderon's cries for help, attempted to rescue him by clearing merchandise, which allowed Calderon to free himself.

Calderon, fearing further accidents because of the forklift's proximity to the obscured freezer door and the possibility of another vehicle entering, requested Barrera to move the forklift. While attempting this, Barrera activated the forklift, which moved in reverse and pinned him against the rack, causing injuries including a herniated disc and impairment to his work capacity.

Barrera filed a lawsuit against Tri-State, claiming negligence. The jury found Tri-State liable, as they had permitted ice to accumulate, creating hazardous working conditions. Furthermore, they ruled the actions of Barrera, as a rescuer, were foreseeable consequences of the original negligence. On appeal, the appellant argued that there was insufficiency of evidence to prove negligence, and that the rescue attempt by a third party (Barrera) was an unforeseeable intervening cause, absolving them of liability. Furthermore, Tri-State claimed the trial court erred by excluding evidence that was intended for impeachment regarding Barrera's work proficiency post-accident. The performance report in question would have potentially refuted Barrera's claims about his reduced work capability.

Verdict:
The appellate court upheld the judgment against the appellant and provided reasoning that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to establish Tri-State's negligence. The accumulation of ice within the facility was a known hazard, Tri-State admitted knowledge of frequent ice formation near the freezer doors, and failed to regularly mitigate this risk. This contributed to the incident which was the proximate cause of Barrera's injuries. The court rejected the argument that the third party's (Barrera's) rescue attempt broke the chain of causality, noting that actions of rescuers are typically foreseeable outcomes of the initial negligent act. In the specific situation, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Barrera's actions were a direct and foreseeable result of the conditions created by Tri-State's negligence.

Additionally, the exclusion of the impeachment evidence was upheld because Tri-State failed to produce the performance report in response to Barrera's discovery request. This was mandatory under the rules governing discovery, which state that withheld items need to be supplemented when obtained. The exclusion was automatic for Tri-State's failure to comply, and the court emphasized that the rule's implementation is mandatory with exclusion as the sole sanction.

In conclusion, the appellate court supported the jury's findings on all counts, affirming Tri-State's liability for negligence and maintaining that the excluded evidence remained invalid due to procedural non-compliance.
