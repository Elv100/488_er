Background:
Coastal Tankships U.S.A., Inc. (Coastal) is the appellant in this case, appealing from a jury verdict that awarded damages to the appellee, Florence Anderson, administratrix of the estate of Morris Anderson. Coastal owned and operated the steam tanker S.S. COASTAL MANATEE, which was used to transport chemical naphtha. Morris Anderson was a utility hand aboard this vessel and was exposed to naphtha fumes that led to his illness and subsequent diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Morris Anderson had no preexisting chronic illnesses or respiratory problems, had never smoked, and had been physically active. He passed a health examination before joining the crew of the tanker. During a voyage, on two occasions, the tanker loaded naphtha and carried it for approximately 11 days, during which crew members smelled strong chemical fumes. Anderson began experiencing headaches, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, shoulder stiffness, and tightness in his chest. His condition worsened over time, and he was eventually taken ashore for medical attention.

Florence Anderson as the administratrix filed a personal injury suit alleging negligence under the Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritime law. At trial, a videotaped deposition testimony of Dr. Miller, Anderson's sole testifying expert on medical causation, was introduced into evidence over Coastal's objection. Dr. Miller testified that Anderson's exposure to naphtha caused his BOOP, based on his differential diagnosis. Coastal's objection centered on the argument that sufficient medical causation evidence was lacking and that Dr. Miller's methodology was unreliable. Coastal also argued that Dr. Miller's opinions, which were based on an assumption (specific causation), could not adequately establish general causation that naphtha exposure can cause BOOP.

Verdict:
The court decided that Anderson's medical expert, Dr. Miller's testimony on causation, was not reliable. Dr. Miller's differential diagnosis was found to be an insufficient method to establish both specific and general causation under the Daubert/Robinson/Jordan reliability test. Specifically, the differential diagnosis assumed but did not establish that naphtha could be a general cause of BOOP. Therefore, this diagnosis could only at best show specific causation and not general causation which is necessary for one to be held liable in a toxic-tort suit.

The appellate court determined that there was no substantial evidence to prove that naphtha exposure could generally cause BOOP. The trial court had therefore abused its discretion by admitting Dr. Miller's testimony as it was based on a differential diagnosis that did not sufficiency establish the causation required under Texas Rule of Evidence 702 and the applicable case law. The court concluded that without Dr. Miller's causation testimony, which the court deemed inadmissible, there was legally insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that naphtha exposure had any role, even the slightest, in causing Andersonâ€™s BOOP. As such, the judgment awarding damages to Anderson administratrix was reversed and rendered in favor of Coastal.
