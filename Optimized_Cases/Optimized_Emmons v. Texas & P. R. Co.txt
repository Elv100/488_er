Background: 
The appellant, an employee, sued the appellee, his employer, for damages resulting from the loss of his left eye, which he alleged was caused by the employer's negligence. The employee claimed that while he was working as a head brakeman on one of the employer's freight trains, a piece of hot sand or other foreign matter was blown from the firebox of the locomotive's engine and struck him in the eye, resulting in the loss of sight in that eye. It was necessary to throw sand into the firebox to clean accumulated soot from the flues, and he suspected that the injury occurred due to the sand being improperly blown out of the sand-hole, a four-inch opening at the end of the firebox that should have been secured by a spring. The employee put forth several specific negligence claims, including that the door to the sand-hole didn't fit securely, the spring was not strong enough, the door was left open by the engineer or fireman without his knowledge, and the atomizer had not been properly adjusted, leading to a backfire which could have blown hot sand or substances out of the firebox. In addition, the employee invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, suggesting that the accident itself implied negligence by the employer.

The appellee denied these accusations and additionally argued that the appellant assumed the risks connected with his employment and that the case was governed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The trial was to a jury, and based on the appellant's evidence alone, the appellee moved for a peremptory instruction, which was granted. As a result, the jury returned a verdict for the appellee, upon which judgment was accordingly entered.

Verdict:
It is likely that the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, rejecting the employee's claim for damages. The reasoning could include that to establish negligence, there needs to be a reasonable and probable connection between the injury and the negligence alleged against the employer, and such a connection must not be left to conjecture. The appellant's claim is based on his testimony and supposition rather than concrete evidence connecting the employer’s alleged negligence directly to his injury. The court may determine that the employee's belief that the injury was caused by sand from the firebox is not sufficiently backed by evidence that excludes other possible causes. Given multiple potential causes of the injury, the employee's failure to demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, that the injury was the direct result of the employer's negligence will be a crucial factor in upholding the dismissal. An affirming court would likely conclude that, as the injury could have resulted from different causes not attributable to the employer’s liability, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply. Further, any errors in the trial concerning the exclusion of testimony about prior reports of the sand-hole door's condition would be considered harmless, as they do not contribute substantially to proving the cause of the appellant’s injury. Therefore, the court's future stance would maintain that the jury did not err in its verdict for the appellee, considering that more than mere suspicion or surmise is required to deprive a defendant of its standing.
