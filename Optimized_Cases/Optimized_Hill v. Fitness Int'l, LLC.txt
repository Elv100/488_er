Background:
Sheri Hill (Appellant) filed a premises liability lawsuit against Fitness International, LLC d/b/a L.A. Fitness (Appellee) for negligence and gross negligence after a slip-and-fall incident. The incident occurred when Hill slipped on water in the ladies' locker room of an L.A. Fitness facility in 2019, causing injury. This suit was filed despite Hill having previously signed a membership application with L.A. Fitness eight years earlier, in which she acknowledged a full and complete release of claims, including those for injury incurred in the facility, with language ostensibly releasing L.A. Fitness from liability even if injuries were caused by its negligence.

In response to Hill's filing, L.A. Fitness sought a traditional summary judgment based on the affirmative defense of release due to the contract signed by Hill and supported by her admitted signing thereof. L.A. Fitness also filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion contesting four elements of premises liability. Hill responded by attaching her deposition transcript, as well as deposition transcripts from a former L.A. Fitness water aerobics instructor and a former member-service and operations manager. L.A. Fitness objected to the admissibility of the former employees' deposition transcripts, and the trial court sustained these objections and granted L.A. Fitness's summary judgment motion.

Further analysis of the summary judgment evidence, however, demonstrated that Hill had provided sufficient testimony to raise a factual dispute regarding the existence of several premises liability elements, including that L.A. Fitness had knowledge that water pooled in the locker room at a specific time of day due to scheduling of an aqua class, and that the lack of mats or a wet floor sign created an unreasonable risk of harm.

Verdict:
Given that Hill signed a release that waived her premises liability claim, the trial court rightly granted summary judgment on this aspect. However, her summary judgment evidence was sufficient to raise a factual issue on all no-evidence grounds presented by L.A. Fitness, and L.A. Fitness didn't move for summary judgment on the remaining elements of Hill's gross negligence claim, nor did it amend its summary judgment motion to address those elements.

The appellate court, based on precedent, would likely join other courts in holding Hill's gross negligence claim could survive a negligence claim's release, emphasizing that a pre-injury waiver of future liability for gross negligence is generally considered void against public policy. The court will likely conclude that Hill's evidence is more than a scintilla and raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding L.A. Fitness's no-evidence grounds. The court would predict that the evidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to draw differing conclusions on the actual or constructive knowledge of hazardous conditions, the existence of an unreasonable risk of harm, the failure of L.A. Fitness to take reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk, and the proximate cause of Hill's injuries.

As such, the verdict will likely encompass a detailed rationale explaining why Hill's gross negligence claim has not been negated by the signed release, despite the premises liability claim being barred, and why the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment on the gross negligence claim. The appellate court would thus reverse the trial court's judgment for the gross negligence claim and remand for further proceedings on this claim.
