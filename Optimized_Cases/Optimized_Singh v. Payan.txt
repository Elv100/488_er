Background:
Perla Montes, who suffered from end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, had an arteriovenous graft placed in her left forearm by a vascular surgeon. The graft became clotted, necessitating intervention for dialysis. Dr. Heramb K. Singh, an interventional radiologist, performed a declotting procedure using a "trellis" device and angioplasty on December 19, 2009. Complications arose, leading to the amputation of Montes's left hand and forearm on December 23, 2009. Montes sued Singh for medical negligence in 2011 and passed away on December 3, 2012, with her daughter, Kendra Payan, continuing the lawsuit as the representative of Montes's estate.

Singh enlisted Drs. Carl Blond and Michael Wholey as expert witnesses. Prior to trial, Payan motioned to exclude Dr. Wholey's testimony on proximate cause, and the court allowed him to testify only on the standard of care. Singh also faced exclusion by the trial court of a portion of his testimony and Dr. Blond's testimony, which intended to address past successful outcomes and post-amputation conditions of Montes.

The trial court sustained objections to Singh's questions about his experience with the trellis procedure and the number of successful outcomes in similar patients, due to relevance concerns and the absence of a sufficiently similar comparative basis. Singh argued that the exclusion prevented him from demonstrating to the jury the basis of his belief that the trellis procedure would be successful for Montes. No proffer of evidence showing similar patients or success rates was made.

Dr. Wholey's testimony on proximate cause was excluded as he admitted having no basis for his opinion that Singh's actions did not cause Montes's injuries and damages. Singh contended on appeal that Blond's testimony was wrongfully limited, and he was harmed by the disallowance of explanation of Montes's condition post-amputation. No offer of proof was made outlining what Dr. Blond's testimony would entail.

The jury's verdict favored Payan, awarding damages for pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, and physical impairment. Singh appealed the judgment.

Verdict:
The judgment will be affirmed as the exclusions and limitations of testimony by Singh, Dr. Blond, and Dr. Wholey do not constitute an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Despite Singh's contention that the exclusions limited his ability to present a full defense, the appellate court will determine that such evidence was either not sufficiently preserved for review or was cumulative and not controlling on a material issue.

As for Singh's testimony regarding his past trellis procedures, his answer about never having another amputation was cumulative of his and his experts' testimonies that he was experienced and followed proper care standards. Moreover, since Singh did not proffer evidence about the number of times he had performed the trellis procedure with a positive result on similar patients, the appellate court will find this complaint unpreserved.

Regarding Dr. Blond's testimony, Singh failed to make an offer of proof specific enough to show the nature of the excluded evidence, failing to preserve the complaint on appeal. The exhibits admitted at trial were insufficient to summarize the excluded evidence that Singh argued was relevant.

As it concerns Dr. Wholey's testimony, the record reflects that Dr. Wholey had no basis for his opinion on causation, and Singh did not prove the proposed testimony was based on sound reasoning, methodology, and non-speculative data. Therefore, the appellate court will conclude that the exclusion of Dr. Wholey's testimony was not an abuse of discretion.

Lastly, the inclusion of the eggshell plaintiff instruction in the jury charge did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The appellate court will reason that the instruction did not assume a verdict, was not a comment on the evidence, and was properly conditioned on the liability findings preceding it. Furthermore, ample evidence was presented regarding Montes's pre-existing condition, justifying its submission to the jury. Since Singh did not preserve the particular argument about the instruction conflicting with the "bad result" instruction, the appellate court will only address the preserved points of contention, which will not meet the threshold for showing that the instruction probably caused the rendition of an improper verdict or judgment.
