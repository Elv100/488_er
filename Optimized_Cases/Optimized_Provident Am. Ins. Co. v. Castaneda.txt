Background:
Denise Castaneda sought damages from Provident American Insurance Company for alleged violations of the Insurance Code and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) due to the denial of her insurance claim. Denise was covered under a family insurance policy that her father, Guillermo Castaneda Sr., had purchased in May 1991. The policy contained two relevant limitations: that illnesses manifesting within 30 days from the policy's effective date were not covered, and diseases or disorders of specific internal organs, including the gallbladder, were excluded unless the loss occurred six months after the policyâ€™s effective date. Denise and her brother exhibited yellow skin throughout their lives, and in July 1991, within 30 days of the policy taking effect, they were diagnosed with hereditary hemolytic spherocytosis (HS) which led to gallstones. Their claims were denied initially due to the six-month gallbladder exclusion but were later denied on the basis that HS had manifested within the 30-day waiting period. Multiple communication attempts were made by Denise's family and doctors to dispute the denial, all of which were denied or remained unacknowledged.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the appellate court's verdict on the grounds that the evidence presented was legally insufficient to support the findings that the insurance company had no reason to deny Denise Castaneda's claim, or that the insurer's liability was reasonably clear. The analysis will hinge upon the understanding that "manifestation" of an illness, relative to the policy's exemptions, does not necessarily mean that the insured had to be aware of the illness for it to manifest. Since both Denise and her brother had exhibited yellow skin and various symptoms before the healthcare policy was enacted, and given the details provided about the uncle's diagnosis within the 30-day period, there is a substantiated argument that HS manifested within the precluded window. Thus, it is predictable that a reasonable insurer could have decided to deny Denise's claims, especially considering the provided timelines and information available to the insurer at the time of denial. Furthermore, the testimony of Denise Castaneda, indicating she had been denied credit cards, is legally insufficient to support a claim for loss of credit reputation due to the absence of evidence proving that the denial of her claim directly resulted in injury or financial harm, such as the inability to obtain loans or incur higher interest rates. As there is no evidence of bad faith or other legal violations by the insurer, and with no findings of liability based on the theories submitted to the jury, the court will render judgment in favor of the insurer, indicating that Castaneda will not recover any damages.
