Background:
The appellant, Christine H. DeLaurentis (Policyholder), purchased a renter's insurance policy from United Services Automobile Association a/k/a USAA (Insurer) in August 2000. In September 2000, she discovered water leaking from the air conditioning unit into her closet that resulted in the growth of black mold on a closet wall. The apartment complex reportedly repaired the leak and associated damage. However, by June 2001, the Policyholder found that the mold issue had not been resolved and had spread throughout her apartment, which prompted her to file a claim with the Insurer.

The City of Houston performed mold tests in July 2001 on her apartment, finding two types of mold. In pursuing her claim, the Policyholder was informed twice by Brenda Essex, a representative of the Insurer, that her mold damage claim would be denied as mold was not a named peril under her policy. Subsequently, during an inspection, claims investigator Candace Shook offered to pay for the water damage and relocation costs, but reiterated that coverage excluded mold damage. Shook requested an inventory of water-damaged property from the Policyholder, which was not furnished by her.

Subsequently, the Policyholder sued the Insurer alleging breach of contract, bad faith, and violations of the DTPA and the Texas Insurance Code. The court initially granted the Insurer's motion for summary judgment on the Policyholder's breach-of-contract claim, then on reconsideration, vacated the order, finally dismissing all of her claims. The Policyholder appealed, challenging 1) the absence of coverage for mold damage, 2) waiver of inventory request as a condition precedent, and 3) her entitlement to present additional extra-contractual claims.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment regarding the breach of contract, bad-faith, and additional DTPA claims. The court will find that the Policyholder is not barred from filing a breach of contract suit because the insurer waived the requirement for a personal property inventory when it informed the Policyholder that mold was specifically excluded as a covered peril under the HOB-T policy. This waiver makes the condition precedent moot, and as such, it will be decided that the Policyholder should not be precluded from suing for breach of contract.

Further, the court will determine that the policy's language unambiguously provides coverage for mold damage caused by a leaking air conditioning unit. Since mold damage is not specifically excluded in the policy, and the damage arises from a named peril (water leak), the Insurer's coverage obligation will be affirmed. Therefore, the Policyholder's first issue will be sustained, reversing the judgment of the trial court and remanding for further proceedings on this particular point.

For the extra-contractual claims, the misrepresentation-based claims will be affirmed by the court since no evidence was presented to support them, focusing on the Insurer's failure to perform under the contract rather than false, misleading, or deceptive acts. However, the court will find that fact issues prevent summary judgment on the bad-faith claims. Since the Policyholder has presented evidence that may establish the Insurer had no reasonable basis to deny her mold damage claim, a potential fact issue is created as to the reasonableness of the Insurer's conduct. Similarly, with the additional DTPA claims, since none of the meritorious grounds in the Insurer's motion specifically attacked these claims, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment on these points as well.

In conclusion, the appellate court will affirm the trial court's dismissal of the misrepresentation-based claims but will reverse and remand the other claims for further proceedings.
