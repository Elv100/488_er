Background:
The case involves an appeal by the appellant, Community Public Service Company, an electric company, challenging the order of the District Court of Red River County, Texas, which found in favor of the appellee, Raymond D. Dugger. Dugger sought damages for the destruction of his barn and other property by fire, which he alleged was proximately caused by the negligence of the appellant's employees.

The incident occurred on June 16, 1967, after a thunderstorm in the Fulbright area of Red River County, Texas. The appellant's employees had been dispatched to repair and restore electrical service to the area, including the appellee's property. The appellant's employees discovered a blown fuse in a transformer serving the appellee's property and, upon replacing the fuse, found that it blew out again. Without adequately checking for short circuits or taking necessary precautionary measures, they replaced the fuse a second time, even though there was evidence of arcing and a popping noise, indicating a short circuit. They also re-energized the line connecting to the appellee's barn, which had no fuse protection from short circuits, soon after which the barn caught fire and was destroyed, along with its contents and nearby buildings.

The appellee introduced both direct and circumstantial evidence of negligence on the part of the appellant's employees. The appellant contended that "no evidence" or "insufficient evidence" supported the implied findings of negligence and proximate cause in the trial court's ruling.

Verdict:
The court would affirm the order finding the appellant liable for damages, as the question of whether the appellant’s negligence proximately caused the fire could be proven by circumstantial evidence. Given the detailed evidence provided, it would be considered that appellant's employees had a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence to prevent injury or damage when handling electricity. The appellant's employees were aware of the dangers inherent in electrical short circuits and were also aware that there was a short circuit present in one of the appellee's lines. They were also knowledgeable that the appellee's barn had no fuse protection. Nonetheless, they carelessly re-energized the line with knowledge of these hazards. 

This failure to properly inspect and ascertain where the short circuit was on the line, or to notify the appellee despite knowing the lack of fuse protection, would be deemed negligent. The employees’ decision to proceed without remedying the identified dangers was a breach of the standard of care expected from a reasonable person under similar circumstances, and thus constituted negligence. 

The prediction would also consider the law that places a duty on those who handle electricity to do so with care proportional to the danger involved. Moreover, the decision would acknowledge that issues of negligence and proximate cause can be supported by circumstantial evidence, which was sufficiently available in this case.

Applying the legal principle that circumstantial evidence can establish cause, the court found that it was more probable than not that the appellant's negligence was the proximate cause of the fire. Theories proposed by the appellant, such as lightning being the cause of the fire, were discounted by their employees’ testimonies. With no alternative explanations reasonably outweighing the circumstantial evidence of negligence, the appellant's argument regarding their service contract with the appellee would not relieve them from liability; attempts to contract out of such responsibility would be contrary to public policy.

Therefore, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed, sustaining the venue of the cause in Red River County, Texas, and concluding that the negligence of the appellant through its employees more probably than not resulted in the destructive fire, leading to the ensuing damages for which the appellant would be held responsible.
