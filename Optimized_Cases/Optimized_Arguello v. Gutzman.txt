  Background: Pete Arguello consulted Dr. Dennis Gutzman due to pain in his right knee. Dr. Gutzman diagnosed Arguello with a torn medial meniscus and proceeded to operate. During the arthroscopic surgery, a piece of the meniscus grabber broke and became lodged in Arguello’s knee. An additional arthrotomy surgery was required to remove the broken piece. Arguello was then released from the hospital and underwent physical therapy. Arguello and his wife subsequently filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Gutzman, alleging misrepresentation, lack of informed consent, and negligence, particularly regarding the use and prior inspection of the surgical instrument. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Gutzman, supported by an affidavit from Dr. Gutzman himself, which included his account of the surgery, a statement of adherence to the standard of care, and a denial of negligence or contribution to Arguello’s injuries. The Arguellos responded by asserting that Dr. Gutzman’s affidavits contained conclusory statements that raised factual disputes regarding the use of the instrument. They argued that res ipsa loquitur applied given the nature of the incident, specifically that the instrument would not have broken without negligence on Dr. Gutzman's part.

  Verdict: The court affirmed the summary judgment granted in favor of Dr. Gutzman. It will hold that the affidavit of an interested expert witness like Dr. Gutzman is admissible to support a summary judgment if the affidavit meets the standards of Rule 166a in that it is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and is readily controvertible. Since Dr. Gutzman is both the physician and an expert in the matter, his testimony regarding not having breached any standards of care and not being the proximate cause of the injury were deemed sufficient evidence to shift the burden of proof to the Arguellos. The Arguellos were then obliged to present a controverting expert testimony of their own, which they failed to do.

  The court will also discuss the principle of res ipsa loquitur, which the Arguellos attempted to invoke, arguing that the type of incident that occurred (i.e., a medical instrument breaking during surgery) would typically not happen without negligence. However, the court will predict that this doctrine is generally not applied directly to medical malpractice cases unless the situation involves matters within the common knowledge of laymen, such as misuse of a mechanical instrument or leaving objects inside a patient after surgery. The court will rule that in this case, the application of the doctrine is not appropriate since the intricacies of the use of arthroscopic surgical instruments would not be within the layperson's common knowledge.
  
  Consequently, because the Arguellos did not produce an expert witness to rebut Dr. Gutzman's claims, the standard of care and causation remain uncontested by expert testimony. Thus, the verdict will affirm the summary judgment on behalf of Dr. Gutzman, with the opinion concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact concerning the breach of duty and proximate cause that would preclude summary judgment.
