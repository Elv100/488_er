Background:
Patient Mary Williford underwent dental treatment with Dr. Richard L. Banowsky and during the procedure, a cut was made in her gum tissue. Williford subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dr. Banowsky for personal injuries she claimed were the result of his negligence during her dental treatment. The trial court instructed a verdict for Dr. Banowsky, essentially concluding the case in his favor without it going to a jury. Williford then appealed the instructed verdict, challenging the need for expert medical testimony to establish negligence and proximate causation. She invoked the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, suggesting that the circumstances implied negligence without needing expert analysis.

Williford argued that her case was of a nature that ordinary negligence rules should apply without the need for medical expert testimony. The incident in question occurred while Dr. Banowsky was preparing Williford’s second bicuspid for a crown. The procedure involved using a high-speed rotary instrument to grind the tooth down to fit the crown, which requires removing enamel below the gum line. During this process, the instrument became entangled with what was described as fibrous material, believed to be either a frenum attachment or mental nerve fibers that were unexpectedly high. Williford did not present an expert witness to testify in her favor, and neither the testimony of Dr. Banowsky nor the deposition from the oral surgeon Dr. Oscar Thompson provided evidence favorable to Williford's claim. Dr. Banowsky testified that the incident was a surprise and was not typical of his previous experiences.

Williford’s claim included suffering such as severe pain, numbness, and a loss of feeling and expression, which she argued would persist into the future. She contended that these injuries were the direct result of negligence particularly attributable to the use of mechanical instruments and the unexpected entanglement of the instrument with the frenum or nerve tissues, positioning the case within the common knowledge of laymen.

Verdict:
The court's reasoning for affirming the directed judgment in favor of Dr. Banowsky will center on the absence of qualified medical testimony to support Williford's legal claims. Since Texas law presumes that a physician has acted properly, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice case must prove, typically with expert medical testimony, that the practitioner's actions were not just a matter of poor judgment but constituted negligence and that such negligence was the proximate cause of injuries. The need for expert testimony can only be disregarded in specific cases where the negligence is apparent to laymen, such as when the wrong part of the body is operated on, or when foreign objects are left in the body post-surgery. 

The court will find that this particular case does not fall under the exception where the common knowledge of laymen is sufficient to establish proof of negligence. The injury sustained by Williford was not obviously indicative of negligence to a non-expert observer. Even though the injuries involved the use of mechanical instruments, the complexity surrounding the procedure and the unforeseen entanglement with abnormal anatomical structures necessitate detailed medical insight to ascertain negligence and causation.

Furthermore, the court will highlight that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is generally inapplicable to medical malpractice cases in Texas, except in cases where negligence is plainly within lay comprehension, which is not the situation here.

In conclusion, based on the lack of substantial evidence of probative force asserting that Dr. Banowsky’s treatment was negligent and causally linked to Williford's injuries, the court will uphold the instructed verdict and confirm that Williford is not entitled to damages from Dr. Banowsky. Therefore, all points of error raised by Williford will be overruled, and the judgment against her will be affirmed.
