Background:
Arturo Flores, a 66-year-old retired brake mechanic, worked from 1966 until his retirement in 2001, primarily in the automotive department at Sears in Corpus Christi. During his career, Flores handled several brands of brake pads, including those made by Borg-Warner. Specifically, from 1972-75, he used Borg-Warner pads on 5 to 7 of the approximately 20 brake jobs he performed weekly. Borg-Warner disc brake pads contained chrysotile asbestos fibers, which made up 7 to 28 percent of the pad's weight. Flores's job involved grinding these pads to prevent squealing, a process that produced dust which he inhaled in a small, confined space.

Flores developed asbestosis, a disease linked to asbestos exposure from his tenure as a brake mechanic. Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by asbestos fibers, which leads to progressive scarring of lung tissue. During the trial, Flores presented testimony from two experts. Dr. Dinah Bukowski, a pulmonologist, diagnosed Flores with asbestosis based on his work history and lung disease evidence. Dr. Barry Castleman, who specialized in toxic substance control, discussed the risks of asbestos exposure for brake mechanics and testified that brake mechanics could be exposed to asbestos by grinding or blowing out brake housings. Borg-Warner presented their expert, Dr. Kathryn Hale, a pulmonologist, who argued that Flores did not have asbestosis based on her examination and the criteria used to evaluate his condition.

At trial, the evidence did not indicate how much asbestos Flores inhaled while grinding brake pads over his career. Nor did it show what proportion of the inhaled respirable asbestos originated from Borg-Warner's products or that the quantity from Borg-Warner's products substantially contributed to his asbestosis.

The jury found Borg-Warner negligent and that their products' defects were a producing cause of Flores's injury. Borg-Warner was apportioned 37% of the causation. Flores was awarded various sums for damages, including compensation for physical impairment and pain and mental anguish, totaling $114,000, and $55,000 in exemplary damages due to malice. The trial court signed a judgment in accordance with the verdict, which Borg-Warner appealed.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, but Borg-Warner petitioned for review, arguing that a plaintiff claiming injury from an asbestos-containing product must meet the same causation standards as in other claims. The case then went to the Supreme Court of Texas for further review.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court of Texas, upon review, will focus on the legal sufficiency of the evidence pertaining to causation, which requires that a plaintiff prove that the defendant's product was a substantial factor in causing the harm. The dose-response relationship, a key concept in toxicology, is crucial here. It requires evidence of the amount of substance (dose) that entered Flores's body to evaluate whether the defendant's product contributed significantly to the development of asbestosis.

Without evidence about the dose of respirable asbestos fibers Flores was exposed to, especially originating from Borg-Warner's products, it is not possible for a jury to determine whether such exposure was substantial enough to cause Flores's disease. Additionally, the Court will consider that while exposure to asbestos-containing products can be a risk, the exposure must surpass a certain threshold to be deemed the cause of the disease.

Considering these factors, the Court is likely to conclude that the evidence presented at trial was inadequate to establish the substantial-factor causation required under Texas law. Thus, the Court will likely find that the causation standard applied by the lower courts was incorrect, and they will reverse the judgment of the appeals court and render judgment in favor of Borg-Warner because Flores did not meet the burden of showing that the asbestos dosage from Borg-Warner's products was sufficient to cause his asbestosis.
