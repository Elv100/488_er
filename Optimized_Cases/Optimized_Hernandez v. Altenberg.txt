Background: 
The appellant, as the sole heir of the decedent Mrs. Hernandez's estate, appealed a directed verdict granted by the 49th District Court of Webb County, Texas, in favor of the appellee physicians and their professional association in a medical malpractice case. Mrs. Hernandez suffered a heart attack and was treated by the appellees, during which a metal guide wire used to place a catheter was accidentally left in her heart. This error was discovered the next day through an X-ray, and, while all five defendant doctors were aware, the patient and her family were not informed. Instead, false information about the need for another operation was given as a pretext to remove the wire. The second procedure did remove the wire but also included actions that covered up the initial mistake. Mrs. Hernandez died on June 8th, having never been informed of the guide wire or its removal operation. After her death, the family learned of the error through an anonymous letter. There was no autopsy performed, and the wire was destroyed by one of the doctors. At trial, the appellant presented expert testimony from Dr. Ronald Katz, suggesting that the delay in removing the guide wire could have caused a fatal blood clot. The trial court instructed a verdict in favor of the appellees, accepting their argument that the appellant had not presented probative evidence linking the guide wire to a blood clot and the clot to the death of Mrs. Hernandez.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the directed verdict based upon the assertion that sufficient evidence was presented to raise a jury question concerning both negligence on the part of the appellee physicians and the proximate cause of Mrs. Hernandezâ€™s death. The appellant successfully showed, through expert testimony, that the actions of the appellees were medically linked to the death of Mrs. Hernandez. The expert witness, Dr. Katz, testified that blood clots could easily form on metal guide wires like the one left in Mrs. Hernandez's heart, and that, based on reasonable medical probability, such a clot formed and caused her death. The court will determine that Dr. Katz's lack of specialization in hematology does not preclude his qualifications to testify about the negligence and proximate cause, given that he is a medical doctor and had pertinent knowledge related to the issue. Moreover, the court will find appellees' argument that there were other possible causes of death insufficient to negate the evidence presented since the expert established that the probability of death from the blood clot was higher than all other potential causes combined. The court will consider that the lack of an autopsy and the destruction of the wire by the appellees should not benefit them, stating a party cannot destroy evidence and then complain about a lack of proof. The court will also find that there are factual underpinnings to support the expert's reasonable medical probability findings, specifically in the presentation of general medical principles that enable the jury to infer causation. Therefore, the court will conclude that the evidence was adequate to entitle the appellant to have a jury determine issues of negligence and proximate cause, making the directed verdict improper. The judgment against the appellant will be reversed and remanded for trial, as the appellant is entitled to have these factual disagreements evaluated by a jury.
