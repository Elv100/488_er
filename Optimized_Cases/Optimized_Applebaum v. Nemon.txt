Background:
The appellees, David Nemon and Suzanne Nemon, filed a wrongful death and survival action for the death of their two-year-old son, Howard Nemon, against the appellants, Montessori Educational Corp. of Texas (doing business as Houston Children's Center), and its officers and employees. On December 19, 1980, Howard was delivered to Houston Children's Center by his parents. During outdoor playtime, he was found unconscious and not breathing by an employee, Jackie Jones, who then summoned Sanford Applebaum, another employee. Applebaum conducted an initial examination, attempted to request an ambulance, and provided mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the ambulance arrived. Howard was transported to two different hospitals and later pronounced dead on December 22, 1980, having been brain dead upon initial hospital treatment.

The jury found for the parents, failing to find that Howard was injured on the playground but determining that the day care center's failure to provide proper life-saving aid and instructing its employees on emergency procedures were acts of negligence that proximately caused Howard's death. They also assessed various damages, leading to a trial court judgment awarding the appellees $304,822.53 against the appellants.

On appeal, the appellants contested the jury's findings of negligence and proximate cause, specifically arguing that there was no evidence of this and that they did not owe the duties ascribed to them, nor were they negligent in their actions. They raised points that the common law did not require them to render medical assistance or prepare for medical emergencies before they occurred, that they had no duty to provide CPR or train employees in emergency life-saving techniques, and there was no evidence that their actions or lack of them proximately caused the child's death.

The expert medical testimony of Dr. Jachimcyk explained CPR as a technique and suggested that prompt administration of CPR greatly increases the chances of survival and prevents permanent brain damage.

Verdict:
The court is poised to reverse the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellees, parents, and render a take nothing judgment against them. The reasoning behind this decision will likely include an emphasis that appellants had a duty to render reasonable assistance to Howard Nemon once he became imperiled and that by performing first aid and securing transportation to the hospital, they fulfilled this duty. The court is expected to assert that appellants were not required under common law to provide specific medical treatments such as CPR or to foresee and prepare for medical emergencies in advance.

With respect to the necessary evidence of proximate cause, the court will likely point out that there was no substantial medical testimony indicating a reasonable medical probability that CPR or a quicker ambulance response would have saved Howard Nemon's life. Emphasis will be placed on the fact that the expert witness's testimony about CPR was based on a hypothetical child who had been unresponsive for less than three minutes, rather than directly addressing Howard's situation.

The court will argue that there were no findings that appellants' actual provision of aid was unreasonable, which is crucial for establishing negligence in the rendition of aid. The court will find no basis in common law or state statute that would impose a duty upon appellants to train staff in life-saving techniques or to anticipate such emergencies. Possible delays in emergency response or lack of training among employees will likely be deemed insufficient grounds for liability without evidence of proximate cause specifically linked to the child's death.

Therefore, the court will likely reverse the previous judgment due to a lack of evidence on the required duty of care and proximate cause, thus siding with appellants and stating that the appellees take nothing from this claim.
