Background:
The case involves a wrongful death suit brought by the mother of three minors, who acted as next friend, against the Dallas Railway & Terminal Company ("the railway" or "appellant"). The lawsuit was filed due to the death of the minors' father, A. H. Archer, resulting from electric shock. On January 8, 1939, Mr. Archer walked into an uninsulated telephone wire that was blown from the defendant's poles by a violent windstorm, striking the company's trolley wire before extending over a street and sidewalk onto a vacant lot. The railway had previously leased the tracks, poles, and trolley wires from the lessor, Northern Texas Traction Company, which retained the telephone wire atop the poles for its exclusive use and assumed its maintenance.

During the incident, the company's poles, tracks, and a trolley wire were in place, marking only the condition that made the injury possible. The jury found that the employees and the company through its employees were guilty of various forms of negligence after the storm—such as failing to warn Mr. Archer of the charged wire, failing to correct the dangerous condition after its discovery or within a reasonable time after they should have discovered it, failing to place barricades, failing to shut off the power to the wire, and failing to remove the charged wire from the sidewalk. The only company employee present at the occurrence, Mr. Middlebrook, who was a street car operator, immediately reported the downed wire upon noticing it but did not have the technical knowledge or equipment to handle the situation and was advised by firemen to move his streetcar, which he did shortly before Mr. Archer walked into the wire.

Verdict:
The reasoning for the predicted verdict in favor of the railway will likely be based on several key points. First, it will be noted that the proximate cause of Mr. Archer's death was the windstorm itself and not the equipment maintained by the railway, with the railway's property only providing the condition that allowed for the injury to happen. Specifically, it will be argued that without the windstorm, no danger would have existed from the defendant's poles or trolley wires.

Second, it will be maintained that the railway was entitled to a reasonable time to ameliorate or correct the dangerous condition, and that the incident taking place approximately twenty minutes after the storm did not provide sufficient time to do so, especially given the complexities involved in cutting off power to the trolley wire, which could have caused even greater harm.

Third, it will be asserted that the sole employee of the company at the scene, Mr. Middlebrook, fulfilled his duty by reporting the hazardous condition and was neither equipped nor required to repair the wire or personally warn pedestrians. It will also be noted that firemen, who arrived on the scene and took charge, instructed him to move the streetcar to prevent congestion, which he complied with just before Mr. Archer's fatal contact with the wire.

Lastly, the verdict will emphasize the argument that the acts of Mr. Middlebrook, the only direct link between the company and the incident, did not constitute negligence that was the proximate cause of Mr. Archer’s death. As such, it will be concluded that no actionable negligence on the part of the defendant or any of its agents has been demonstrated, and therefore, the railway's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted by the trial court. Consequently, the appellate court will reverse the trial court’s judgment and render a verdict in favor of the railway.
