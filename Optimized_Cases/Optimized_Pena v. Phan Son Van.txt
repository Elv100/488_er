Background:
The plaintiffs in this case are the survivors and fiduciaries of Elizabeth Pena and Jennifer Ertman, two teenage girls who were sexually assaulted and murdered by gang members during a gang initiation ceremony. The plaintiffs are suing Phan Son Van, the owner of P-One Food Store, for negligence, gross negligence, and negligence per se. The defendant, Phan Son Van, is being accused of selling alcohol to the assailants who were minors or visibly intoxicated at the time they made the purchase. The violation of the Tex. Alco. Bev. Code §§ 2.02 and 106.03 is the basis for the negligence claims.

The plaintiffs allege that the defendant was negligent in the sale of alcohol to the underage assailants and claim that this act of negligence was a proximate cause of the subsequent assault and murder of the two girls. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that his conduct did not proximately cause the girls' deaths because the assailants' criminal actions were an unforeseeable, superseding cause. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment without specifying grounds, and the case was severed with the plaintiffs appealing the decision.

The defendant's supporting evidence for the summary judgment motion includes the victims' autopsy reports, assailants' indictments, judgments of conviction for capital murder, and excerpts from the testimony at the criminal trial. The plaintiffs responded by arguing that the defendant did not exclude the sale of alcohol as a proximate cause, contending that proximate cause is a fact issue, and presenting criminal trial testimony excerpts indicating that the gang members were "all hyper and drunk," "all worked up," and "getting out of control" before the crime took place.

Verdict:
The appeal court is expected to reverse the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Phan Son Van, and remand the case for further proceedings. In overturning the summary judgment, the court will likely reason that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the sale of alcohol to the minors and visibly intoxicated assailants by the defendant proximately caused the murders of Elizabeth Pena and Jennifer Ertman. 

The court will likely find that proximate cause, composed of cause in fact and foreseeability, cannot be resolved by mere speculation or as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage. For the defendant to have been granted summary judgment, he would have to incontrovertibly prove that there was an absence of foreseeability, implying that no person of ordinary intelligence could have anticipated the danger created by the negligent act, and that the assailants' criminal conduct was unforeseeable and therefore a superseding cause of the deaths. However, the defendant’s evidence merely establishes that the crimes occurred and fails to negate foreseeability.

Given that the defendant provided judgments of conviction and evidence that the meeting was chance-based and did not affirmatively demonstrate the unforeseeability of the criminal acts following the sale of alcohol, the defendant did not fulfill his burden at the summary judgment phase. The court will emphasize the need for a practical, common experience-based inquiry into whether a person of ordinary intelligence could have anticipated the general nature of the harmful conduct that followed the consumption of liquor by the minors. 

Thus, the court will rule that this is a disputed fact issue that should be determined by a jury at trial. The plaintiffs are likely to be allowed to proceed to trial to prove that the defendant’s sale of alcohol to the assailants was a substantial factor and a foreseeable result of which the assault and murders would not have otherwise occurred. The reversal will be based on the perspective that foreseeability and causation are intensely fact-specific inquiries that are commonly reserved for a jury's assessment, rather than for determination by the court as a matter of law.
