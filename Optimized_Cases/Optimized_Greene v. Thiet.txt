Background:
The appellant, Raquel Greene, underwent two simultaneous surgeries performed by appellee physicians, Dr. Michelle Thiet and Dr. Matilda Perkins. The procedures were abdominoplasty, liposuction, and cholecystectomy. Greene had previously been turned away for the cosmetic surgeries due to her weight but later returned when she required a cholecystectomy, requesting that the cosmetic procedures be performed at the same time. Both Dr. Thiet and Dr. Perkins agreed to the combined surgeries. Greene was informed about the risks associated with each surgery individually and also the slightly increased risk of complications from concurrent abdominal operations. She consented to the surgeries regardless.

The surgeries were completed within the time frame normally expected for abdominoplasty and liposuction alone. Post-surgery, Greene suffered complications including necrosis that led to additional medical procedures, including three debridements and a skin graft. Greene acknowledged that necrosis is a recognized complication of the surgeries she underwent and could occur in the absence of any negligence.

Greene filed a lawsuit against the physicians, initially including a claim of traditional negligence in performing the surgeries but subsequently amended her pleadings to only claim lack of informed consent. She alleged that if she had been informed of the increased risk of performing both surgeries simultaneously, she would not have consented to both. Her affidavit contained her lay opinion, with no expert testimony to support her claims.

The physicians moved for summary judgment, contending that the evidence showed that the combination of surgeries performed within the normal time frame for one surgery did not cause the injury. This motion was granted by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellee physicians. The reasoning for this verdict will be that the appellee physicians successfully negated the causation component of Greene's informed consent claim by showing that the surgeries, performed in the normal time frame for one surgery, did not cause the necrosis. It will be further noted that there was no expert testimony from Greene to sufficiently raise an issue of fact with respect to the causation component negated by the physicians' summary judgment evidence. In the absence of competent expert controverting evidence on the issue of causation, Greene's personal affidavit will not be considered sufficient to create an issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.

The verdict will likely emphasize the requirement that in informed consent cases, a plaintiff must establish not only that a reasonable person would have refused the treatment if fully informed of all inherent risks but also that the plaintiff was injured by the occurrence of the risks of which they were not informed. Greene's failure to meet this "but for" or "sine qua non" standard of causation, which would require expert testimony demonstrating that the injury would not have occurred but for the physicians' failure to disclose the combined risks, will be pivotal in affirming the summary judgment. The predicted outcome is that the appellate court will hold the physicians met their burden by negating causation, and Greene did not present sufficient controverting evidence to survive summary judgment.
