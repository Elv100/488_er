Background:
La Neta Bobinger underwent a total arthroplasty of her left hip on May 11, 2015, at Tomball Regional Medical Center (Hospital). Her surgeon, Dr. Michael Blackwell, and radiologist, Dr. Voon Ping Liaw, reviewed her post-operative x-rays and concluded that the hip showed "satisfactory alignment without fracture or loosening." During her recovery in the hospital, Bobinger exhibited an unsteady gait, could tolerate little weight bearing, had a lot of swelling in the left hip and thigh area, and experienced pain levels that were out of proportion despite pain medication. The physical therapist noted her inability to meet a short-term goal of climbing stairs and documented Bobinger's significant pain and swelling. Upon discharge, despite these issues, she was readmitted on May 19 with a fracture of the proximal femur. Following a second surgery, she was readmitted again on June 9 with a prosthetic-joint-and-hardware infection and transferred to St. Joseph Medical Center, where she was diagnosed with a failed arthroplasty and a greater trochanteric femoral fracture. A surgeon at St. Joseph performed a revision surgery on her hip, reduced both fractures, and drained and debrided her hip wound.

Bobinger brought negligence claims against the Hospital, Dr. Blackwell, Dr. Liaw, and Houston Northwest Radiology Association, focusing on her vicarious liability claim against the Hospital based on alleged omissions by its physical therapists and nurses. She alleged that the Hospital failed to properly administer drugs, evaluate her before discharge, diagnose and monitor infection and misalignment, improperly discharged her, and discharged her while she had a misaligned fractured hip and infection. As a result, she claims to have suffered physical pain, mental anguish, impairment, disfigurement, incurred medical expenses, and loss of earnings.

Bobinger filed and served an initial medical expert report by Dr. Cecil Rene Arredondo, which the Hospital objected to for various grounds, including failure to adequately differentiate between physicians, nursing, and therapy care. The trial court sustained the objections and granted an extension for an amended report. Dr. Arredondo's supplemental report stated standards of care for physical therapists and orthopedic floor nurses and declared they breached the standards by not informing Dr. Blackwell of Bobinger's persistent pain and inability to progress in physical therapy before discharge, which contributed to her injuries.

The Hospital filed a motion to dismiss for failing to adequately address the standards of care, breach, and causation, which the trial court denied. The case hinged on whether expert reports made an objective good faith effort to comply with the statutory definition of an expert report and demonstrated that Bobinger's claims had merit.

Verdict:
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hospital's motion to dismiss. The expert reports from Dr. Arredondo represent an objective good faith effort to comply with the definition of an expert report in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 74.351(r)(6) and show that Bobinger's claims against the Hospital's physical therapists and nurses have merit. Specifically, the reports sufficiently identify applicable standards of care relevant to physical therapists and nurses, notably in terms of their responsibilities to report significant post-operative pain, lack of progress in physical therapy, and significant swelling, to the orthopedic surgeon. This reporting is especially critical as orthopedic surgeons rely on such communication from nurses and physical therapists to assess post-operative difficulties and decide on patient discharge.

Furthermore, the reports adequately address the breach aspect by documenting the failure of the Hospital's physical therapists and nursing staff to report the observed issues, differing from the Hospital's assertion that the breach was conclusively shown as absent because the issues were documented in the medical records. Contrary to the Hospital's claim, the documentation alone does not fulfill the communicative duties necessary to ensure proper re-evaluation and patient care decision-making by the surgeon.

In terms of proximate cause, Dr. Arredondo's reports articulate both the foreseeability and cause-in-fact elements. The Hospital's contention that the reports fail to connect the Hospital's conduct to Bobinger's injuries is not persuasive; the reports detail how the Hospital's failure to fully communicate her post-operative condition contributed to an inappropriate discharge and delay in receiving surgical intervention, ultimately leading to significant pain and complicating her recovery. The reports do not expect nurses and physical therapists to diagnose Bobinger's hip fracture, but through observations to identify issues that require urgent re-evaluation by the surgeon before patient discharge, as severe pain itself is a compensable injury when exacerbated by improper healthcare decisions.

As the reports demonstrate a plausible link from the Hospital staff’s actions to Bobinger's subsequent injuries—both due to prolonged pain and delay in identifying the femoral fracture—they satisfy the "good faith effort" requirement for establishing causation. Lastly, the reports need not predict or address all possible defenses the Hospital might raise, only establish a reasonable basis showing that the Hospital's acts or omissions proximately caused injury to Bobinger. The trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss will be upheld as Dr. Arredondo's reports provide a sufficient basis to conclude that Bobinger's claims against the Hospital's physical therapists and nurses have merit.
