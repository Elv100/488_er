Background:
C. E. Boyer, the plaintiff insured, parked his automobile on a downtown street in the City of Waco on May 11, 1953. Shortly thereafter, a tornado struck the town, bringing lightning, rain, hail, and strong winds. One or more of these elements caused part of a nearby masonry building to be demolished, and debris from the building—including bricks and timber—fell upon and completely destroyed Boyer's automobile. Boyer held an automobile insurance policy on his car, which included a "Collision or Upset" clause with a $50.00 deductible. However, he did not carry insurance coverage for windstorms. After Boyer filed a claim for the value of his destroyed automobile ($1,100.00), the defendant insurance company denied the claim. The basis for the denial was that the destruction of the automobile was not the result of a collision but was due to a windstorm. The trial court agreed with Boyer that the damage resulted from a collision and rendered judgment in his favor. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld the trial court's decision, referencing previous cases and stating that the impact between the falling debris and the car constituted a collision within the terms of the insurance policy. The insurance company challenged this interpretation, citing other cases, arguing that the dominant cause of destruction was the windstorm, not a collision. The case was brought before the Supreme Court for final adjudication.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court will reverse the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals and the trial court's judgment, concluding that Boyer is not entitled to recovery under the collision clause of his insurance policy. The Court will firmly establish that the true cause of the damage was not a collision but rather the windstorm, which is a distinctly defined peril in insurance policies and not covered under Boyer's collision clause. The Court will clarify that a collision, in common understanding, would require a more direct and forceful contact between two objects in motion, which was not the case here, as the bricks and timbers only impacted the car due to being carried by the wind.

The Court will emphasize the purpose and practices of the State Insurance Commission in defining and segregating insurance risks to allow the public to choose intentional coverage options. By parsing the various coverages provided by an insurance policy, the Court will state that Boyer made a conscious decision to purchase collision coverage without opting for windstorm coverage—which would have included protection against the kind of event that destroyed his vehicle. The Court will cite Glen Falls Ins. Co. v. McCown for the principle that insurance policy terms should be understood in their everyday meaning and consider the consumer's choices in determining policy intent.

The Court will reinforce that the ultimate determination of whether a loss falls within a given coverage provision of an insurance policy is guided by the clear definitions and intent behind these definitions as established by the Insurance Commission. Therefore, the ruling will be centered on the premise that the loss falls under the policy's windstorm provision, which Boyer did not select, and not under the collision provision. The Supreme Court's decision will lead to a judgment that Boyer take nothing, and costs will be taxed against him.
