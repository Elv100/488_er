Background:
On May 31, 2016, a construction worker named Jose Camerino Maravilla was electrocuted and his coworker, John Paniagua, was injured while they were working on a home being constructed by Weekley Homes, LLC. Paniagua and Maravilla’s relatives (referred to collectively as "appellants") filed a lawsuit against Weekley and others, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and premises liability. The contention was that they were storing scaffolding on a wet concrete floor during a storm which led to their electrocution. The appellants claimed there were no warnings about the energized temporary power poles and lines that could cause the surface area to become energized due to nearby electrical poles.

Weekley Homes filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because Paniagua and Maravilla were employees of an independent contractor hired for framing and cornice work, Chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code applied, thus absolving Weekley from liability unless certain conditions were met. Weekley claimed that they had no control over the manner in which work was performed and lacked knowledge of any dangerous condition.

Appellants contended that Weekley knew about the dangerous weather conditions and should not have told workers to move the scaffolding during the rain. They put forth that there was actual exercise of control by Weekley over the work conditions, as evidenced by instructions given by Weekley's representative on the site, Mr. Holmes.

The trial court initially granted Weekley’s motion for summary judgment, and subsequently, denials were made for appellants' motions for reconsideration and new trial, and for leave to designate experts late.

Verdict:
In evaluating the applicability of Chapter 95, even if all legal procedures were followed with the declarations, there's no definitive proof that the injuries originated from working on the very same improvement as stated under the Chapter. Hence, Weekley did not conclusively show that the Chapter 95 protections were applicable. Consequently, the trial court's granting of the traditional summary judgment based on Chapter 95 was erroneous.

Regarding the no-evidence summary judgment for negligence and premises liability claims, appellants presented more than a scintilla of evidence demonstrating a duty owed and the possibility of a nexus between their injuries and the control of their working conditions by Weekley. This includes Mr. Holmes's selection of the metal scaffolding, and his instruction to continue work through bad weather. Additionally, Longeway’s expert report provides crucial and new facts, which were not previously available or discoverable before the trial court's ruling, and is likely to produce a different result upon retrial. Consequently, the denial of appellants’ motion for reconsideration and new trial concerning negligence and premises liability claims was an abuse of discretion by the trial court.

However, appellants failed to provide substantive evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Weekley's actual, subjective awareness of risk—a required element for a gross negligence claim. Therefore, the trial court was correct in denying the motion for reconsideration and new trial in relation to the gross negligence claim.

Ultimately, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s verdict on the gross negligence claim, reversed the verdict on the negligence and premises liability claims, and remanded those parts back to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.
