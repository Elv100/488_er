Background:
In September 2017, during Hurricane Harvey, David Woollen and Wayne Hill were performing rescue operations by boat in a flooded area in Hardin County, Texas. Their boat struck an energized power line resulting in electrocution and burns to Woollen and Hill. They subsequently filed a negligence lawsuit against Entergy Texas, Inc., the operator of the power line, claiming Entergy had breached its duty by failing to take proper precautions such as de-energizing the power lines to protect rescuers during the hurricane. Woollen testified that he had heard that power was supposed to be off, but neither he nor Hill had contacted Entergy about the power lines before the accident. Witnesses to the accident confirmed they were trying to stay away from the power lines because of uncertainty regarding their status, and that the contact occurred when the boat drifted towards a line.

Entergy countered with an affirmative defense of negligence per se on part of the plaintiffs, claiming a violation of Texas Health & Safety Code §§ 752.001-.008, which sets forth requirements for activities near high voltage overhead power lines. Entergy posited that because Plaintiffs engaged in activity that brought the boat — without prior arrangements for safety measures — within the six-feet safety perimeter of the high voltage overhead power line, they had to indemnify Entergy for all liabilities and damages incurred from the electrical contact. Entergy insisted this circular indemnity claim means that Plaintiffs' own claims are legally extinguished.

Plaintiffs argued Chapter 752 of the code was not applicable during natural disaster rescue efforts and on water, as opposed to land, buildings, or highways. They suggested interpreting the statute to apply only to anticipated work around power lines. The trial court denied Entergy's motion for summary judgment, prompting Entergy to appeal on grounds that Chapter 752's provisions did apply to the incident.

Verdict:
The Court of Appeals will reverse the trial court's denial of Entergy's motion for summary judgment based on the interpretation of Chapter 752. The verdict is expected to outline that the broad language of the statute clearly extends to both employment and non-employment activities, utilizing terms like "work," "activity," or "function," and does not exempt private persons engaged in rescue operations. The court will insist that the intent behind the statute is to ensure safety near power lines and place the burden of liability on anyone performing activities near power lines, regardless of their intent or whether it involves work.

The Court of Appeals will reason that the flooded property under the boat remains a "premises" as defined by law, and thus, the rescuers should have arranged safety measures before engaging in the activity. Regardless of the plaintiffs’ lack of intention to perform work near the power lines, plaintiffs were engaged in an activity that brought them within proximity to a high voltage line, making them liable for not notifying Entergy in advance.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals will highlight that the indemnity provisions of Chapter 752 will apply even in the face of allegations of negligence against Entergy. Since there are no explicit exclusions for persons performing rescue operations in the legislation, plaintiffs' claims will be considered extinguished by the statute's circular indemnity provision. The verdict will be detailed, acknowledging the legislative history but chiefly relying on the plain language of the law and the implications of the plaintiffs' noncompliance. As a consequence, Entergy’s appeal will be sustained, the trial court's Amended Order will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with the verdict of the Court of Appeals.
