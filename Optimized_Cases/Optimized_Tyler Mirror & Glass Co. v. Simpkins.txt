Background:
An appellant company, Tyler Mirror & Glass Company, and its driver, appealed a judgment from the 115th District Court, Wood County (Texas), which awarded damages to the appellee for personal injuries sustained in a collision with the appellants' truck. The appellee, Zodie Simpkins, along with her husband Ollie Simpkins, sued the appellant company and driver, Alan Mauldin, alleging negligence on part of Mauldin which led to the collision and various injuries on a specific date, August 14, 1963. The injuries claimed included head injuries, an arm fracture, cuts and abrasions on her legs, broken ribs, loss of eyesight due to the development of a traumatic cataract, colon and gall bladder trouble, as well as high blood pressure.

In the trial, the judge gave the standard jury charge, instructing them to award damages which were the direct and proximate result of the incident. The jury found against the defendants on the primary negligence issues, also ruling out contributory negligence and other issues for the plaintiffs, granting an award of $14,778.00 for damages sustained by Mrs. Simpkins and $1,400.00 for additional hospital, medical, and drug expenses.

The appellants did not contest their liability but claimed that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury regarding damages. They challenged that there was no evidence of causal connection between the accident and Ms. Simpkins' loss of eyesight, colon and gall bladder trouble, and/or high blood pressure, and that these issues should have been explicitly excluded from the jury's consideration when determining damages. They had requested written exclusionary instructions that the judge refused. The appellants sought a reversal and remand based on these alleged errors.

The court found that the medical testimony did not affirmatively state that the loss of eyesight, colon trouble, gall bladder trouble, and high blood pressure were, in reasonable medical probability, a result of the accident. Appellants contended that this went against established legal standards which require plaintiffs to prove a causal connection beyond mere speculation or conjecture, and that expert testimony is required to establish causation of diseases or injuries not common knowledge to laypeople.

Verdict:
The court will reason that because there was no evidence of probative force connecting Mrs. Simpkins' loss of eyesight, colon trouble, gall bladder trouble, and/or high blood pressure to the accident, the standard jury charge did not properly limit the jury's consideration of damages proximately caused by the collision. Given that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causal relation with respect to damages sought, the court will reverse the trial court's award of damages due to the lack of proper limitation in the jury's consideration for damages directly tied to the negligence of the defendants. 

This decision will be predicated upon several legal principles: a plaintiff must show causation for the specific injuries claimed, and proof is required beyond speculation or mere coincidence with the accident. Expert medical testimony is generally necessary to establish causation for complex medical conditions unknown to laypersons, and the causal connection must be established with evidence that allows for reasonable inference, especially in cases involving disease processes or complex medical conditions such as cataracts and high blood pressure.

The appellants' requested exclusionary instructions aimed to prevent the jury from considering the conditions unrelated to the accident regarding the award of damages. Since the trial court did not provide these instructions, and considering there was no probative evidence linking the injuries in question to the accident, the court will conclude that it was erroneous for the jury to assess damages for these conditions. Consequently, by not instructing the jury otherwise, the court permitted them to potentially base their award on non-proximate or unsubstantiated claims of injury, thus leading to the reversal of the judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings to limit damages to those proximately caused by the accident.
