Background:
A medical malpractice action arose from the death of Bob Hogue, who died after medical staff failed to timely provide necessary services to diagnose his condition. On March 5, 1998, Bob Hogue complained of an upset stomach and dizziness. Dr. Jay Story examined him the next day and diagnosed him with pneumonia, prescribing medicine and scheduling a follow-up appointment. Hogue's condition worsened and he was sent to Columbia Medical Center of Las Colinas, where Dr. Blomquist advised he be placed on a ventilator. Dr. Schroeder, a specialist, and Dr. Blomquist concluded that Hogue would need a cardiologist consult and an echocardiogram (echo). However, the hospital, which had elected to outsource echo services, had not guaranteed a response time for such studies.

The echo, critical for diagnosing Hogue's condition, was significantly delayed as the echo technician was not given the impression that Hogue needed urgent attention. The study was not completed until about three hours after it was ordered, identifying a severe leakage of Hogue's mitral valve, which required emergency surgery. Hogue was then transferred to another hospital for surgery but died shortly after arrival.

Hogue's family sued Columbia Medical Center for medical malpractice, asserting survival and wrongful-death claims. The jury found the hospital negligent and grossly negligent, initially awarding over $30 million in damages. The trial court and Court of Appeals reduced this, and the hospital appealed, challenging several issues including the legal sufficiency of evidence for gross negligence, loss of inheritance damages, and the application of interest rates on the judgment.

Verdict:
The Court will find the majority of the judgment against Columbia Medical Center appropriate. The trial court did not err in refusing to submit a contributory negligence question in the first trial phase because there was no evidence that doctors would have acted differently if Hogue had disclosed his heart murmur diagnosis. There existed clear and convincing evidence that the hospital was grossly negligent: it decided not to provide timely echo services by not securing a guaranteed response time for outsourced echo services, did not inform its medical staff of this limitation, and thus dangerously delayed a critical diagnostic service to Hogue, contributing to his death.

However, the evidence for loss of inheritance damages, awarded to Hogueâ€™s widow, will be considered insufficient as it failed to prove that Mrs. Hogue would outlive her husband based on health, or that Hogue's future earnings would exceed his expenditures, leaving an estate for inheritance. The calculation of these damages did not account for all variables specific to Hogue's situation.

Furthermore, amendments to the Texas Finance Code regarding interest rates on judgments will not apply to this case, as the final judgment was signed before the effective dates of the amendments, and the appeal could not have commenced after the amendments' effective dates.

Therefore, the Court will reverse the award for loss of inheritance damages but affirm the remainder of the judgment, including the reduced actual damages and capped exemplary damages based on the finding of gross negligence.
