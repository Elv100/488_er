Background:
In May 1980, Dr. Francisco Ruiz-Ortiz performed a lumpectomy and reconstructive surgery on Sue Tuley, during which he implanted silicone breast implants. Prior to the surgery, Tuley specifically requested saline implants and reasserted her preference to Ruiz-Ortiz by stating she did not want silicone implants. Ruiz-Ortiz assured her she would receive saline implants. However, in 1992, Tuley, while undergoing a mammogram with Ruiz-Ortiz, questioned him about the implants, and he reassured her that they were indeed saline. Two years later, in 1994, while Tuley was having an MRI for upper respiratory problems, it was discovered that the implants were, in fact, silicone, and evidence indicated that at least one implant had ruptured. The removal of these implants left Tuley with scarring and disfigurement. Tuley initiated a lawsuit against Ruiz-Ortiz and several Dow Corning entities claiming multiple causes of action, including misrepresentation, breach of warranty, and failure to provide informed consent. 

Tuley's lawsuit against Ruiz-Ortiz specifically highlighted the failure to provide informed consent. After the suit against the Dow parties was moved to federal court, Ruiz-Ortiz filed a no-evidence summary judgment motion, claiming Tuley failed to provide expert medical testimony to support her allegations, as required for proving standard medical care breach and proximate cause. Tuley responded to the motion without an expert medical report, contending instead that Ruiz-Ortiz's use of silicone instead of saline implants was evident of battery and that this did not require an expert report to establish the breach of the agreed-upon procedure. Following this, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Ruiz-Ortiz. Tuley subsequently filed a new motion for trial, this time invoking the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), but this was denied.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court likely reasoned that the convincing burden for a medical malpractice claim, based on negligence in failing to disclose risks, lies in proving breach of duty and proximate cause through medical testimony, as established under the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act (MLIIA). However, Tuley did not provide expert testimony supporting her claim, rendering her evidence legally insufficient. 

Even though Tuley tried to argue that her claim stemmed from the pre-amendment DTPA rather than negligence, she cited the case Sorokolit v. Rhodes in her defense. In Sorokolit, the claim was based not on negligence but on a guarantee of surgical results. This was different from Tuley's case, where warranty and misrepresentation claims were directed against Dow corporations, not Ruiz-Ortiz. Tuley's claims against Ruiz-Ortiz solely pertained to the alleged breach of duty to disclose and obtain informed consent, which tracks the language and requirements of the MLIIA and not the DTPA.

From the court's viewpoint, Tuley's late invocation of the DTPA did not convert her medical malpractice claim, which lacked the requisite medical expert report, into a viable DTPA claim against Ruiz-Ortiz. Since Tuley's claim against Ruiz-Ortiz did not contain allegations of an express warranty of a particular result or knowing misrepresentation as articulated in the DTPA, but rather centered on breach of informed consent, the summary judgment was seen as appropriate. The court was likely to emphasize that Tuley's failure to submit the required expert report on standard medical care was fatal to her negligence claim. Thus, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment, supporting Ruiz-Ortiz's summary judgment based on no evidence provided by Tuley that fulfilled the legal standards for medical malpractice under Texas law.
