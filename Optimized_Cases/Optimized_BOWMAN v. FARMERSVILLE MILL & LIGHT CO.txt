Background:
The case involves an appeal by parents (appellants) of the deceased, Joseph E. Bowman, who was killed after coming into contact with a live electric wire belonging to the appellee, an electric utility company. The wire had fallen during a severe and unusual lightning storm. The appellants argued that the company was negligent in various aspects: permitting the wire to fall, failing to maintain a system to indicate a downed wire, failing to discover and rectify the downed wire situation, not shutting off the electricity, and employing incompetent personnel at the power plant.
The appellee countered that the wire fell due to lightning and that the deceased was contributorily negligent for touching the wire despite being aware of the danger and having been warned. A jury trial initially found in favor of the utility company. The appellants contended on appeal that errors were made relating to the jury instructions.
Joseph E. Bowman was a 19-year-old blacksmith with a monthly income of about $75. On the day of the incident, he had sought shelter at John Holloway's house during the storm. Holloway warned him about the downed wire that was burning the grass. Despite this, and after Holloway left to notify the electric plant, Bowman touched the wire and was instantly killed.
The evidence presented showed that the appellee had an appliance to indicate a fallen wire, and it was up to the jury to decide whether the company exercised due diligence in the incident and whether their actions or lack thereof were negligent. The appellants argued that the utility company failed to keep a suitable ground detector or comparable appliance to identify and announce a grounded wire or fallen wire at the power plant.

Verdict:
In the reasoning for the verdict, if maintained, it will likely be concluded that the trial court's general charge to the jury was sufficient to cover the alleged negligence by the utility company concerning the fallen wire. The merit of the charge would be that it asked the jury to consider if the appellee, despite knowing of the wire's fallen state and the dangers it posed, failed to act with ordinary care in a timely manner to mitigate the danger, which would constitute negligence if it led to Bowman's death.
However, the key argument underpinning the verdict in favor of the appellee would be the contributory negligence of the deceased. Under this reasoning, the facts established that the deceased was aware of the live wire's danger yet still chose to come into contact with it. This action would be interpreted as a clear display of contributory negligence, which inherently negates a crucial requirement for the appellants to succeed in their negligence claim.
Given the circumstances, if any errors occurred in the jury instructions, they would be considered harmless because the established contributory negligence of the deceased rendered any debate over the appellee's potential negligence moot. Thus, any such errors would not have changed the outcome, and the verdict rendered would be seen as the only appropriate verdict under the law. Therefore, the prediction would be that the appellate court would affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of the utility company, concluding that the appellants had not met their burden of proving the appelleeâ€™s negligence was the sole cause of Bowman's death and had failed to overturn the contributory negligence finding.
