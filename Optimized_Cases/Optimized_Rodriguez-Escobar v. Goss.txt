Background:
The background of the case involves a claim of negligence against Dr. Diego Rodriguez-Escobar by the respondent sons of Beverly Goss, who committed suicide. The sons claimed that the doctor negligently failed to involuntarily hospitalize their mother despite her history of suicidal behavior and clear risk of committing suicide. Goss's depressive state was born from her husband leaving her, and it had already resulted in a suicidal gesture—a shotgun discharge in her bedroom—leading to her initial hospitalization.

After the discharge incident, Beverly Goss voluntarily admitted herself to McAllen Medical Behavioral Health Center (MMBHC) and was treated for depression by Dr. Cesar Matos. While admitted, she expressed a desire to leave but withdrew her request after a discussion with Dr. Matos. Concerned for his mother's well-being and recognizing her suicidal risk, Goss's son Michael obtained an emergency detention warrant for involuntary admission to a state mental health facility.

Despite the warrant and the application filed by Michael, Dr. Matos discharged Goss to Tropical with the intent to transfer her to Rio Grande for continued treatment. Upon evaluation at Rio Grande, Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar examined Goss, reviewing her previous medical records, the emergency detention application, and the warrant. He also conducted an approximately 45-minute interview with Goss.

Following his evaluation, Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar determined that Goss did not meet the necessary criteria for involuntary hospitalization. He recommended outpatient treatment and released her on March 26, 2003. After her release, she visited her son Michael and appeared to be in an improved state. She attended a follow-up appointment with her family doctor and was evaluated by a social service worker who found her agreeable and not exhibiting signs of depression.

Communications with neighbors and her estranged husband about their ongoing separation and financial matters followed in the days after her release. Notably, Goss purchased a gun on the evening of March 29 and ultimately used it to commit suicide by a gunshot wound on March 30, 2003.

The Goss sons pursued a negligence case against Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar for failing to involuntarily commit her. The jury found against the doctor and awarded $200,000 in damages. The trial court upheld the verdict, and the Court of Appeals for the Thirteenth District of Texas affirmed the decision. Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar sought a review of the case by a higher court.

Verdict:
The verdict in favor of Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar is based on the prediction that the Supreme Court will agree that the evidence presented is legally insufficient to substantiate a causation link between the doctor's alleged negligence and Beverly Goss's suicide. Considering previous case law, the court will determine whether it was foreseeable and a cause-in-fact (but for the doctor's negligence, the suicide would not have occurred) that Goss would take her life after being released. 

In reaching the decision, the court will likley examine the specifics of the doctor's evaluation process, including the criteria he used to assess the necessity for involuntary hospitalization and his subsequent decision based on Goss's presentation during their interview. Despite the trial court's and Court of Appeals' affirmation of the jury's decision, the higher court will conclude that nothing in the expert testimony or presented evidence proves that the doctor's failure to hospitalize Goss caused her death in fact. 

Furthermore, the court will consider the predictability of suicide after voluntary discharge and the timeliness and disconnectedness of events from the moment of discharge to the act of suicide. This analysis will incorporate the testimony that Goss's depression was potentially treatable and would not have led to her suicide during the hypothetical period of hospitalization, as well as the fact that there was no certainty about the effect of hospitalization on her long-term prognosis.

Highlighting the lack of evidence indicating that hospitalization would have prevented Goss's suicide after release, the court will find that the doctor's decision not to involuntarily admit her was not a substantial factor in bringing about her death. In this anticipation of the high court's rationale, the decision will be to reverse the lower court's judgment and render judgment in favor of Dr. Rodriguez-Escobar.
