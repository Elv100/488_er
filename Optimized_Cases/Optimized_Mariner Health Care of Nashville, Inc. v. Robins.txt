{Background: 

Betty Battle was an elderly woman living in southwest Houston with adult sons and nearby daughters who visited her frequently. A smoker of approximately one to one-and-a-half packs of cigarettes a day, Betty Battle suffered from various pre-existing conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, kidney problems, dehydration, malnutrition, and possible dementia. After suffering a fall and undergoing hip replacement surgery in March 2004, she was transferred to Mariner Health Care of Nashville, Inc. for rehabilitation, where she did not have any pressure ulcers upon admission according to her primary physician, Dr. Khoa Nguyen. However, during her stay, Battle developed stage-3 and stage-4 pressure ulcers, was transferred to different hospitals for blood transfusions and ulcer care, and returned to Mariner still suffering from the ulcers.

Battle died on August 18, 2008, with cardiopulmonary arrest listed as the cause of death, though an autopsy was not performed to ascertain this definitively. Gladys Robins, Battle's daughter, filed suit against Mariner for medical malpractice under both the Texas Wrongful Death Act and Survival Statute, alleging that Battle’s injuries and death resulted from negligent care provided by the nursing home. A jury found in favor of Robins solely on the survival action, awarding her $750,000 in damages, which the trial court later reduced to $250,000 under the statutory cap on damages.

Mariner appealed, raising four issues: whether Robins had the standing or capacity to pursue claims on behalf of Battle's estate; whether the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining two challenges to peremptory strikes; whether the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's findings on negligence, proximate cause, and damages; and whether the trial court improperly submitted broad form questions pertaining to damages to the jury.

Robins argued that she had standing to sue as an heir to the estate and that Mariner had waived any complaint about her capacity to sue by not filing a verified plea contesting her capacity. Mariner’s challenges also touched upon various aspects of the nursing home care, including specificity in identifying negligent employees, the qualification of Robins's expert witness, and the relationship between the alleged deficiencies in care and Battle’s injuries. The trial court's action regarding peremptory strikes was also a point of contention. Robins further witnessed that her mother experienced pain, while medical experts offered testimony about the standards of care for elderly patients and pressure ulcers.

{Verdict: 

The appeals court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, supporting the damages awarded to Robins. In addressing Mariner's first issue, the appeals court will determine that since Robins initiated a lawsuit within two years of Battle's death and because Mariner didn’t challenge her capacity with a verified plea during litigation, any claims regarding Robins's standing or capacity are deemed waived. The Battle's estate had a justiciable interest in the controversy sufficient to confer standing on Robins to bring the survival action.

Regarding Mariner’s second issue, the appeals court will find that Mariner has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion when it sustained Robins's challenge to the peremptory strike of an African-American veniremember, given that the stricken juror ultimately did not support the verdict against Mariner. This issue will be considered harmless as it had no bearing on the final outcome of the case.

For the third issue, the court will conclude that the expert testimony, specifically from Dr. Lipson, was legally and factually sufficient to support the findings of negligence, breach of care, and the proximate cause of Battle's injuries. Dr. Lipson’s qualifications, expertise, and testimony provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the neglectful care provided by Mariner and its direct impact on Battle’s condition. The evidence presented at trial will demonstrate that Mariner failed to meet the standard of care in hydration, nutrition, pain management, and prevention of pressure ulcers, which contributed to Battle's pain and suffering.

As for Mariner's fourth issue, the court will determine that Mariner failed to preserve its objection to question 7 of the jury charge because it did not specifically object to that question during the charge conference and instead directed its objections to other parts of the charge. Consequently, any claim of error in the submission of damages in broad form will not be considered. The discretion lies with the jury to decide on the amount awarded for subjective and unliquidated issues such as pain and suffering, which will be deemed supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the appeals court will uphold the trial court’s decision, deeming that Gladys Robins, as representative of Battle’s estate, had standing to sue, that Mariner's arguments are without merit, and that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict and the adjusted award of $250,000 to Robins on the survival action.}
