Background:
Miss Edna Ellison, the employee, was a long-distance telephone operator for the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, which was the employer, and the Texas Compensation Insurance Company was the insurer. She commenced her employment around May 5, 1930. On September 15, 1930, while Ellison was performing her duties during a rain and electric storm, she received an electric shock through her headphones, which led to her being carried out of the room in distress by supervisors. Following initial unconsciousness, she later indicated she had been shocked while putting a call through. 

Miss Ellison managed to return to work after a few days and continued her duties satisfactorily until May 20, 1932, twenty months post-injury. On that date, Ellison fell violently ill, claiming she felt like she did when shocked, and subsequently died on May 30, 1932. Throughout the intervening period between the accident and her death, according to testimonies, Ellison's disposition had changed from vibrant and sociable to withdrawn and perpetually run-down, suffering from various pains and worrying about her health, indicating a lasting impact from the incident.

Following her death, a jury found that the electric shock sustained at work was accidental, the cause of her death, and therefore, Ellison's mother, Mrs. Nannie Ellison, as the surviving parent and sole beneficiary, was entitled to workmen's compensation benefits. The appellant employer challenged this, arguing that there was no causal connection between the injury and death due to the time elapsed and that her death was attributed by physicians to "infectious psychosis." Furthermore, the employer claimed that the injury incurred was the result of an act of God—a defense outlined in the 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 8309 —and not due to employment conditions since Ellison was not exposed to any greater hazard than the general public.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment in favor of the employee's mother. The court will hold that the defense of an act of God does not apply in this case because the injury caused, although potentially initiated by an act of God (lightning), occurred due to the employee being engaged in her normal work duties using equipment provided by the employer—specifically, the headphones connected to the switchboard that proved to be the immediate cause of the injury. It will be noted that metallic wires act as conductors for electric currents from lightning and the employee, through her duties, was exposed to a greater hazard from such an act of God than the general public, making the injury compensable under the law.

The argument that no causal connection existed between the injury and the death will be rejected based on the substantial evidence pointing towards such a connection. The employee's persistent health issues and behavioral changes following the shock will be seen as a direct result of the initial incident. Despite the initial recovery and the ability to perform her duties, the longstanding impact of the shock, both mentally and physically, suggests a causal link to her eventual deterioration and death. The court will find that the concept of proximate cause, relevant for negligence cases, does not apply to compensation cases, and therefore the request to establish proximate cause will not warrant a directed verdict.

Regarding the appellant's contention on the award calculation, the court will find that the method of calculation for the compensation adhered to legal requirements outlined in statutes, utilizing the average weekly wage of similar employees. Appellant’s propositions on this front will also be overruled. The court will dismiss objections to the length of time for which compensation was awarded, affirming that the statute specifies compensation should begin from the date of the injury, regardless of any temporary recovery or wages earned by the employee thereafter.

In sum, the court's future reasoning will emphasize that the injury, while perhaps stemming from an act of God, was incurred in the scope of employment which posed a special risk not encountered by the public, and the effects of which causally contributed to the employee's eventual demise. The court will thus support the original award of benefits to the employee's mother.
