Background:
The background of this case originates from an automobile accident on July 15, 2016, in Randall County, where Appellant Anatonia Flores sustained head injuries. Flores filed a negligence claim against Appellee Jerry Rector, alleging that the accident was proximately caused by Rector's negligence. Rector was driving with his wife along South Loop 335 in Amarillo, Texas, at 70 miles per hour using cruise control, when Flores, stopped at the intersection of South Loop 335 and FM 2530, pulled into the intersection in front of Rector's vehicle, resulting in a collision. Rector did not recall applying brakes due to the swift nature of events. A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper determined that Flores failed to yield right of way at the stop intersection and issued her a citation, which Flores later pleaded guilty to.

Flores' lawsuit claimed that Rector was negligent by failing to keep a proper lookout, to maintain attentiveness, to apply or timely apply brakes, to take evasive action, and for driving at an excessive speed. After Flores filed suit, Rector submitted a hybrid motion for summary judgment, including both traditional and no-evidence grounds, countering that there was no evidence of a duty breach or proximate cause leading to Flores's injuries. The evidence Rector provided in his motion included unsworn declarations from himself, his wife, the responding trooper, the trooper's crash report, a third-party witness voluntary statement, and a certified copy of Flores's citation for failing to yield. In opposing the motion, Flores argued that Rector was possibly impaired by alcohol consumption, which would prevent him from foreseeing traffic risks or taking appropriate evasive action. Supporting her response, Flores included excerpts from Rector's deposition and a recording of a 911 call made on the night of the accident, which was excluded by the trial court. The trial court granted Rector's summary judgment without specifying whether it was for the traditional motion, the no-evidence motion, or both, nor the grounds for granting the motion. Flores contested the decision, leading to this appeal.

Verdict:
Rector's motion for summary judgment was correctly upheld by the trial court because Flores's claims lacked evidence of both a breach of duty by Rector and proximate cause. The facts that a collision occurred and the manner in which it did are not inherently indicative of negligence on Rector's part. Furthermore, Flores failed to present evidence that Rector's consumption of two beers prior to the accident impaired him in any significant way or contributed to the collision. As a result, any attribution of negligence to Rector based on these arguments would be purely speculative. 

Additionally, the summary judgment evidence did not sufficiently establish Rector as the proximate cause of the collision and Flores's injuries. Although Flores presented speculation on the physics of the vehicles' movements during the accident, there was no substantive evidence that Rector could have anticipated Flores's actions or had sufficient time to react to prevent the collision. The summary judgment evidence demonstrated Rector as driving at the posted speed limit, aware of the roadway and surrounding vehicles, fulfilling the standard for a reasonably prudent driver. Thus, no reasonable juror could conclude that Rector was negligent given the available evidence.

Given these considerations, the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Rector is affirmed because there is no evidence beyond a mere suspicion that Rector breached any duty owed to Flores or that said breach was the proximate cause of the collision and resulting injuries. Flores's appeal is overruled, and the original judgment stands.
