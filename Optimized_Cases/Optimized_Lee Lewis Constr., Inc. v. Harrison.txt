{Background: The lawsuit involved an incident where Jimmy Harrison, an employee of subcontractor KK Glass, fell from the tenth story of a hospital building to his death while installing glass glazing. Lee Lewis Construction, Inc. (LLC), the general contractor, was sued by Jimmy's family (Norma Harrison, individually and as the next friend of her children Sumer Dawn and Jimmy Thor Harrison, and May and Sellie Harrison) for negligence, negligence per se, and gross negligence. KK Glass was also sued for gross negligence by the family but settled before trial. LLC filed a cross-claim against KK Glass for contractual indemnity or contribution, which was granted summary judgment by the trial court.

A jury found that LLC retained "the right to control safety" at the construction site, and found LLC both negligent and grossly negligent. As a result, the jury awarded compensatory and exemplary damages to the Harrison family. LLC challenged this verdict, particularly the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the finding of negligence and the award of exemplary damages, the accuracy of a jury issue submitted by the court, the admission of evidence allegedly depicting subsequent remedial measures, and the validity of the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to KK Glass.

The procedural background included LLC's assertion that it did not retain an unqualified duty to ensure a safe workplace for the employees of its subcontractors, but to ensure that any safety measures enacted did not increase the risk of harm. The case presented complex questions concerning the extent of the duty of a general contractor regarding safety measures and the subcontractor’s independence in matters of safety, and whether LLC assumed a duty to affirmatively act vis-a-vis matters of safety, including the use of fall protection equipment.}

Verdict: {The appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court’s judgment regarding the award against LLC for negligence and gross negligence while also affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment to KK Glass. The court may agree that legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that LLC retained the right to control safety and was negligent and grossly negligent in exercising that control. The prediction is that the court would reason that LLC did more than merely require subcontractors to abide by general safety measures, as evidenced by the contracts between LLC and Methodist hospital, in which LLC agreed to supervise and direct the work, be responsible for construction means and methods, and maintain and supervise all safety precautions and programs, including the protection and safety of subcontractor employees.

Furthermore, the appellate court would likely consider the stipulations set forth in the contract between LLC and KK Glass, which included the required adherence to safety rules, providing a first aid kit, and allowing LLC to remove non-compliant KK Glass employees from the site. The frequent mentions of safety, the initiative that LLC took to oversee and enforce safety, and LLC's president's admission that LLC "wanted responsibility of" safety on the job site, including making sure that subcontractors worked safely, will substantiate the jury's conclusion that LLC had a significant degree of control over job safety.

Regarding the claim for excessive damages for pain and mental anguish, the court may call for a remittitur due to the award being factually excessive based on the duration of suffering before Jimmy's death. A detailed comparison of prior case awards for conscious pain and suffering may lead the court to significantly reduce LLC's compensatory damages.

As for LLC's cross-claim against KK Glass, the appellate court will probably uphold the summary judgment granted in favor of KK Glass, finding that LLC failed to satisfy the express negligence rule, which requires specific contractual language to indemnify a party from its own negligence. The court will distinguish between indemnity and contribution and will likely point out that contractual indemnity is not the same as contribution, which is unavailable here due to the exclusive remedy provision under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act. The court will consider LLC's arguments in its cross-claim, particularly the broad language seeking indemnity from "any and all damages," as indicative of seeking full indemnity, not limited for damages solely caused by KK Glass, which ultimately does not meet the express negligence requirement.

Taken together, given the detailed evidence of contractual obligations, safety program requirements, LLC's supervision at the construction site, witness testimony, and existing legal principles on indemnification and contribution, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's ruling on LLC’s gross negligence and summary judgment for KK Glass while suggesting a remittitur on the pain and suffering damages awarded to Jimmy's estate.}
