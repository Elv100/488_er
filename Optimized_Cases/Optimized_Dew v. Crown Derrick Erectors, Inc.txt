Background:
Paul Dew, an employee of one of Rowan Companies, Inc.'s associated companies, died after falling through an opening in an oil derrick platform known as the Gorilla V, which was under construction at the time. The Gorilla V, a multi-tiered offshore drilling rig, was designed by Woolslayer Companies, Inc., for use in the North Sea, with safety gates required around ladder openings. Rowan had hired Crown Derrick Erectors, Inc. to erect the Gorilla V from parts manufactured by Woolslayer, beginning construction in March 1998.

During the construction, Crown Derrick discovered missing parts necessary for installing safety gates around one ladder opening on the fourble platform. Upon informing Rowan's construction manager, who notified Woolslayer of the missing parts, Crown Derrick eventually left the site on August 28, 1998, with the gates still uninstalled. Before leaving, they placed a double rope barricade around the unprotected opening.

Crown Derrick returned to the site on September 22, 1998, to complete work but found the crane needed for the installation inoperative and reported that they were still missing parts for the safety gates. The next day, without any further work on the site and no inspection of the double-rope barricade, Paul Dew fell to his death through the opening.

The double-rope barricade wasn't maintained after Crown Derrick initially left the site. Subsequently, an electrical junction box may have covered the opening, which was later replaced by a single-rope barricade. There were no witnesses to the accident, and it remained disputed whether even the single-rope barricade was in place when Dew fell.

Paul Dew’s wife and parents sued Rowan, Woolslayer, and Crown Derrick for wrongful death and survival, with the trial jury finding all three defendants negligent and apportioning fault among them. Crown Derrick appealed, asserting the trial court erred by not submitting a jury instruction on new and independent cause. The appellate court agreed, prompting the case's presentation for review.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the appellate court's judgment and remand it for the appellate court to consider other issues raised in the appeal. The argument made by the erector (Crown Derrick) will not hold because the assumption that its double rope barricade constituted an adequate safeguard will be rejected since the jury verdict indicated that it wasn't. Crown Derrick breached its duty of ordinary care by leaving the platform opening without adequate safeguards. Therefore, any subsequent alterations to this inadequate safeguard, like removing or altering the ropes, would not qualify as a new and independent cause—since they did not fundamentally change the foreseeable consequences of Crown Derrick's original negligence.

The court will assert that Crown Derrick isn't entitled to a new and independent cause instruction based on several aspects. First, the risk of danger was obvious once they left an open hole without proper permanent protective measures. Second, any acts which altered the barricade didn't bring a fundamentally different kind of danger but merely exploited the original risky condition left by Crown Derrick. Third, the foreseeability of others disrupting the ineffective barriers is consistent with the original risk Crown Derrick was responsible for. Fourth, it was foreseeable that Crown Derrick’s original negligence, leaving a hole unprotected adequately, could lead to the very injury that occurred, reflecting that this was within the initial scope of risk. Finally, the role of the double-rope barricade can be deemed insufficient due to its easy removability, directly linked to the causal chain leading to Dew's death. The court will likely stress that the principles of new and independent cause dictate that an unforeseen, independent intervening act must not be an expected consequence of the original negligent act for it to supersede the initial act, which is not the case here.
