Background:
On April 22, 1983, Tom Beeson underwent cardiac bypass surgery and received seven units of blood by transfusion. In late May 1987, symptoms indicative of potential HIV infection arose and, by June 1987, both Tom and his wife Esther were diagnosed as HIV positive. Tom died on July 2, 1987. The Beesons filed a wrongful death and personal injury suit against the J.K. and Susie L. Wadley Research Institute and Blood Bank (Wadley), alleging that Tom contracted AIDS through a contaminated blood transfusion received during his surgery, and that Wadley had been negligent in screening blood donors and testing blood donations for infection.

The parties stipulated that the blood Tom received was donated by a sexually active homosexual male with multiple sex partners, identified as John Doe. Wadley argued that the Beesons' claims were barred by the statute of limitations given that Tom's injury occurred at the latest by April 22, 1983, hence the claim should have been filed by 1985. Conversely, the Beesons claimed that their cause of action only accrued when Tom exhibited symptoms in May 1987, due to the nature of the injury being inherently undiscoverable and that they had filed the lawsuit within two years of this date, thus within the statute of limitations period.

The court had to consider the applicability of the discovery rule, which tolls the statute of limitations until an injury is discovered or could have been discovered through reasonable diligence. They also evaluated whether Wadley's screening procedures were effective and whether Wadley's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the harm to the Beesons.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment for the Beeson family members based on several findings. The Beesons will have successfully argued that they filed their lawsuit within the statute of limitations period given that they only discovered Tom's infection in 1987, which aligns with the discovery rule that tolls the statute of limitations until the injury is discovered or reasonably could have been discovered. The court will find that their claim of wrongful death and personal injury was filed within this period and that they had correctly pleaded sufficient facts regarding the discovery of the injury.

In terms of the Beesons' entitlement to bring the action, the court will dismiss Wadley's claim that the Beesons' causes of action are time-barred. The verdict will hinge on the legal principle that Tom would have been entitled to bring suit had he discovered his injury within the limitations period. Since the Beesons' claim relates back to the original filing, which is within the statutory limit, Esther's personal injury claim arising from the same set of facts will also not be barred by the statute of limitations.

Regarding causation, Wadley will fail to establish that there was a lack of evidence to show causation and foreseeability. The court will conclude that the jury reasonably could have determined that Wadley's negligent conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to the Beesons. The evidence will suggest that Wadley's screening and donor education procedures were inadequate at the time of the blood transfusion in 1983 and could have led to the transmission of HIV from Doe's donated blood to Tom.

As such, the court will determine that Wadley's argument against foreseeability is without merit and will uphold the jury's finding that Wadley should have anticipated the danger of transmitting HIV through blood transfusions based on the knowledge available at the time. Consequently, the court will affirm the trial court's decision in favor of the Beesons, thus holding Wadley liable for its negligence in causing the wrongful death of Tom Beeson and the personal injury of Esther Beeson.
