Background:
The case revolves around the tragic suicide of a thirteen-year-old girl, A.W., after she was treated for depression by her pediatric health-care providers at Pediatrics Cool Care. The patient had been a client of the practice since 2010 and on March 1, 2012, her mother brought A.W. to the clinic where she expressed feelings of constant sadness and an inability to control her emotions. Physician assistant Jenelle Robinson diagnosed A.W. with depression after a brief consultation, prescribed the antidepressant Celexa, and "strongly recommended" counseling. The medical record indicates that Robinson provided a list of counselors. A.W.'s mother, however, testified that no list was provided and that A.W. had refused counseling, preferring to rely on medication and a teacher at school for support.

Robinson's handling of the situation was questionable, as she did not recall if she had inquired about suicidal ideation or warned of Celexa's risks, though she stated it was likely she had done so following usual practice. Robinson also failed to ask A.W. privately about her feelings, did not use diagnostic checklists, and there was uncertainty over whether she instructed a follow-up visit. In addition, due to a transcription error, A.W. was prescribed three thirty-day refills for Celexa, which exceeded limits set by regulations.

On April 17, A.W. visited the practice again due to migraines. Nurse practitioner Allyn Kawalek examined her and, based on A.W. and her mother's reports, noted a positive change in mood. Subsequently, after A.W.'s parents filed a lawsuit, an unknown individual altered A.W.'s medical record from this visit.

Approximately three and a half months later, on July 31, A.W.'s mother called for a refill of the Celexa prescription. Medical assistant Bernadette Aguillon, without proper authorization, approved the refill despite A.W. being overdue for a follow-up. Aguillon later attempted to conceal this error by altering medical records after learning of A.W.'s suicide.

On the evening of August 14, A.W. was discovered dead by her mother, having committed suicide by an overdose of Benadryl. Both A.W.'s parents claimed they had no indication she was suicidal, nor had A.W. disclosed suicidal thoughts to anyone else.

A.W.'s parents sued Pediatrics Cool Care and involved healthcare providers (collectively, the providers), alleging negligence and gross negligence. Expert testimony was provided by Dr. Herschel Lessin on care deficiencies, but he did not testify on the cause of death. Another expert, Dr. Fred Moss, stated that despite the provider's negligence in prescribing Celexa, the drug was not a cause of A.W.'s suicide, and even if the providers had been negligent, A.W. might have committed suicide nonetheless. He postulated that had the providers asked the right questions, they could have presented A.W. with treatment pathways that might have prevented her suicide.

On the contrary, another expert, Dr. Armando Correa, stated that teenage suicide is often impulsive and, in most cases, cannot be prevented, though in A.W.'s case her suicide was considered to be an impulsive, unpreventable act.

The trial court asked the jury to determine if the providers proximately caused A.W.'s death. The jury found Dr. Salguero and Robinson liable and Kawalek not liable, resulting in a multi-million-dollar verdict, later reduced to $1.285 million. The liable providers appealed the sufficiency of evidence for the verdict, admission of Dr. Moss's testimony, and the calculation of prejudgment interest. The court of appeals affirmed the verdict without analyzing but-for causation and upheld Dr. Moss's testimony as factually grounded and reliable based on his experience and training.

Verdict:
The future prediction for the verdict in this case, considering the standard of but-for causation applied in medical malpractice cases leading to suicide, is that the court will reverse the judgment of the appellate court and render in favor of the medical providers. Despite the tragic outcome and identified negligence in the patient's care, the evidence from Dr. Moss would be deemed legally insufficient to meet the but-for causation standard required to establish proximate cause for medical negligence in a suicide case.

The test for but-for causation requires showing that the negligence was a substantial factor in causing the injury and that without the act or omission, the harm would not have occurred. Dr. Moss's testimony relied on a series of speculative assumptions: that had the providers correctly conducted an intake assessment, A.W. would have disclosed suicidal tendencies; that A.W. would have pursued treatment pathways provided by the providers; and that such treatments would have prevented her suicide.

Moreover, the expert testimony will not sufficiently exclude alternative plausible causes for the suicide. Without reliable scientific grounding to differentiate between patients who might commit suicide regardless of proper care and those who wouldn't, the court would require but-for causation as a standard.

Dr. Moss would be criticized for not presenting facts substantiating a concrete connection between A.W.'s treatment and her eventual suicide. It would be held that an expert's assumptions, however informed by clinical experience, must be supported by actual evidence in the record, not contradicted by the established facts such as the patient's prior refusal of counseling. Given the absence of evidence that without the providers' negligence, A.W.'s suicide would not have occurred, and due to the speculative nature of the expert testimony, the providers' negligence would be deemed too attenuated to be the proximate cause of the suicide. Therefore, the verdict would be rendered in favor of the providers, reversing the appellate court's judgment.
