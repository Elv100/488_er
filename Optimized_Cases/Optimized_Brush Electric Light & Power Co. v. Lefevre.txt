Background: Appellant power company was involved in a lawsuit initiated by appellees husband and wife following the electrocution and subsequent death of their son. The incident occurred when the husband sought to lift power lines, belonging to the power company, which were hanging low across an intersection and impeding the movement of a house they were assisting to move. After the husband received an electrical shock while attempting to lift the wires, the son went to his aid, caught hold of two wires, and was fatally electrocuted. The husband and wife alleged negligence on the part of the power company, asserting that it violated a local ordinance by not maintaining the wires at the required height of twenty-five feet above street level. Initially, judgment was awarded to the husband and wife by the trial court, a decision which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals but later reversed and remanded. The trial court's refusal to sustain the company's exception to the husband and wife's pleadings was called into question, as they had failed to allege the specific provisions of the local ordinance they claimed was violated. Additionally, it was necessary to prove both that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of a wrongful act and that it should have been foreseeable by the company. There was no evidence presented that indicated the awning where the incident occurred was ever used by anyone, thus suggesting that it was not foreseeable that someone would come into contact with the wires.

Verdict: The court likely found that the appellees' allegations concerning the local ordinance were not sufficiently specific, as they did not include its provisions either in terms or substance. This lack of specificity meant that the trial court should have sustained the special exception filed by the power company. Furthermore, the power company could not reasonably have anticipated that someone would be on the awning and at risk of injury due to the exposed wires, since there was no evidence that the awning had ever been used by anyone else previously. The power company's duty of care did not extend to unforeseeable outcomes, and as such, there was probably no evidence of negligence contributing directly to the son's death that the jury could have used to find in favor of the husband and wife. An ordinarily prudent person would not have foreseen the risk presented by the wires because the awning was not intended for public access or use. The appellate court, therefore, likely determined that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury to find in favor of the power company, as an assessment of the evidence according to the standard of foreseeability and the specifics of the local ordinance indicated no actionable negligence by the power company. Consequently, the award of judgment to the husband and wife was likely reversed and the case remanded due to the error in not sustaining the company's exception to the pleadings, and due to the absence of evidence supporting a claim of negligence on the part of the power company.
