Background:
This case concerns a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, AutoZone Parts, Inc. (AutoZone), against the plaintiffs, Dorothy Sands, individually and as a representative of the estate of Cecilia Stanford (deceased), and Julie Stanford. The plaintiffs brought claims of negligent undertaking and gross negligence against AutoZone, arising from an incident on October 23, 2017, involving Cecilia Stanford.

AutoZone is an automotive parts and accessories retailer that provides a complimentary diagnostic service, advertised as "Fix Finder", to help customers understand the reasons behind their vehicle's check engine light. The service includes a diagnostic test using an electronic scanner that communicates with the vehicle's onboard computer, comparing results against a database of repair solutions and generating a free report. If an identifiable repair cannot be made at AutoZone, the policy is to refer customers to a qualified mechanic.

Cecilia Stanford visited AutoZone when her check-engine light came on. After the diagnostic test, she was given a report indicating trouble code "P1751," which suggested a fault in the automatic transmission control relay circuit. There was no recommendation for specific repair parts or actions. Stanford called her sister, Kara, and discussed the issue described, including that an AutoZone employee reportedly told her it was okay to drive the vehicle home. Stanford intended to visit a mechanic post-work, and Kara offered her a ride home from the shop.

On her commute to work, Stanford's vehicle stalled on the road. Despite warnings from her sister not to leave the safety of her vehicle, Stanford attempted to push her car out of the traffic lane, during which she was fatally struck from behind by motorist Dacota Deaver. Deaver admitted that his inattention to the road likely contributed to the accident. Sands subsequently filed wrongful death and survival claims against AutoZone, alleging reliance on AutoZone's implied assurance of vehicle safety directly placed Stanford in her fatal situation.

AutoZone sought a combined no-evidence and traditional motion for summary judgment, contending there was no evidence that AutoZone's actions proximately caused Stanford's injuries and death. The trial court granted the motion without specific comments, leading to Sands's appeal.

Verdict:
The trial court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of AutoZone will be upheld. The central argument for the defense would be that no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the proximate cause, and specifically the first element of cause-in-fact. It would be argued that any alleged negligence by AutoZone in advising Stanford on the condition of her vehicle is too remote to have materially contributed to the fatal incident. Cause-in-fact requires that the defendant's actions were a substantial factor in causing the injury and that the injury would not have occurred but for those actions. In this case, Deaver's admission of not maintaining a proper lookout is likely to be portrayed as the active and efficient cause of the accident. As such, AutoZone's alleged negligence would materialize as merely a condition for the injury rather than its direct cause, making the connection to the fatal outcome too attenuated to support legal causation.

Furthermore, since successful negligent undertaking and gross negligence claims require evidence of proximate cause, the failure of the negligent undertaking claim inherently dictates the failure of the gross negligence claim. By this reasoning, there would be consensus that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to produce evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact about the challenged elements of their claims. Thus, AutoZone's no-evidence motion for summary judgment on these claims was appropriately granted, and the trial court's ruling will be confirmed.
