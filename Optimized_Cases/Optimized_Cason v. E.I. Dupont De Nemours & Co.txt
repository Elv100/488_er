Background:
Plaintiffs initiated a product liability action, alleging injury from temporomandibular joint (TMJ) implants. The defendants in this case were E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor), and Louisiana State University (LSU). The key factual elements of this case are as follows:

- DuPont sold polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) under the trademark "Teflon" to Vitek, a company that used these materials to make medical devices, including the TMJ implant in question. DuPont warned Dr. Charles Homsy, Vitek's founder, that Teflon was not made for medical use and that detailed studies on its long-term suitability for medical applications had not been conducted. Homsy acknowledged this but continued to utilize PTFE in his products.
- Homsy held positions at both Methodist Hospital and Baylor, where he was involved in biomaterials research and teaching. Baylor is separate from Vitek and was not involved in developing, designing, or selling the TMJ implants.
- LSU was implicated because an employee, Dr. Kent, contributed design and development services for the TMJ implant.

The plaintiffs alleged that DuPont had a duty to warn as a raw material supplier, Baylor was negligent in hiring Homsy and failed to warn of the TMJ implant’s dangers, and LSU was liable because of Dr. Kent's involvement. The trial court granted summary judgments in favor of DuPont and Baylor and sustained a special appearance and plea to jurisdiction for LSU, barring the case from being heard further against LSU.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the summary judgments granted to DuPont and Baylor and sustained LSU's plea to jurisdiction, thus preventing the lawsuit against LSU from proceeding in Texas.

The court will find that DuPont had no duty to warn the plaintiffs because it supplied a non-defective, multi-use raw material to Vitek. DuPont’s warnings to Homsy about the use of Teflon for medical purposes and his acknowledgement of these warnings negate any potential duty to warn on DuPont's part. The court will also conclude that there is no evidence that DuPont took part in designing or manufacturing the final TMJ implant product.

Concerning Baylor, the court will determine that Baylor did not owe a duty to supervise Homsy's work at the PRL related to the TMJ implant, nor did it have any involvement with the development or testing of the TMJ implant. Furthermore, Baylor's hiring of Homsy for teaching duties, which are unrelated to the manufacture or design of the implant, cannot be the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries.

LSU's plea to jurisdiction will be sustained on the grounds of comity and Louisiana’s sovereign immunity laws, which mandate that this suit cannot be brought outside Louisiana state courts. The court will recognize Louisiana as a cooperative jurisdiction and find no violation of Texas public policy in applying Louisiana law to grant LSU sovereign immunity.

The decisions will be based upon the court's interpretations of applicable product liability law, concepts of duty and negligence, the acknowledged limitations of the roles played by DuPont and Baylor with respect to the TMJ implant, and jurisdictional considerations with LSU. The court will emphasize that any liability requires a direct connection between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff’s injury. Given the evidence, the plaintiffs' claims do not establish such a connection firmly enough to hold any of the defendants liable.
