Background:
Twenty-one-year-old Lance Dowell had a previous history of mental health issues, including a prior suicide attempt when he was 19, which led to a voluntary hospitalization and treatment at DePaul Center, a psychiatric treatment division of respondent Providence Health Care. In the days leading up to the incident in question, Lance was in a distraught state due to trouble with his teenage girlfriend and an incident where he ingested pills and cut his wrist, leading to a call from his girlfriend to his mother, Carolyn. Despite concerns, his mother, a registered nurse, saw no signs of serious health risk at that time.

The situation escalated when Lance's girlfriend's parents instructed him to stay away from their daughter. In a state of distress, Lance cut his left wrist with a pocket knife and hid from the officers in the woods, returning only to insist that his brother, Larry, let him "finish it." The officers then took Lance into custody and transported him to the emergency room (ER) at Providence Health Care in Waco, where he was examined by a nurse, Mary Theresa Fox, and by ER physician James C. Pettit. While his previous suicide attempt and a family history of mental illness increased his risk of suicide, Lance's assessment in the ER was brief, and neither Fox nor Pettit conducted a comprehensive evaluation of his suicide risk.

Despite concerns, Lance was released that same morning on the conditions that he sign a no-suicide contract, follow-up with the Mental Health and Mental Retardation (MHMR) center on Tuesday, and promise to stay with his family until then. Over the weekend, Lance’s mother took measures to surround him with family and monitor him closely, and while Lance repeatedly assured her he would be okay, he ultimately ended his life by hanging himself 33 hours after being discharged from the ER.

Lance's parents, Carolyn and Jimmy Dowell, brought a wrongful death and survival action against the health care providers, alleging negligence in the ER's discharge of Lance without a proper assessment of his suicide risk, which they claimed was the proximate cause of his death. The jury sided with the Dowells, finding the defendants liable and awarding damages. The trial court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict, and upon appeal, a divided Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. The health care providers then appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court of Texas held that there was a lack of proximate cause between Lance Dowell's discharge from the emergency room and his eventual suicide. The Court reasoned in a forward-looking manner that, based on the factual background, there was no evidence indicating that Lance could have been involuntarily hospitalized or would have consented to hospitalization voluntarily. Even if there were negligence in conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, this negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about Lance's suicide, which was deemed too remote in time and circumstances from Lance's release from the ER.

The Supreme Court would rule that any connection between Lance’s discharge and his subsequent suicide was too attenuated to establish proximate cause. The Court would assert that Lance had control over staying at the facility or leaving, and both he and his family did not display belief in the necessity of hospitalization. Lance had specifically communicated his desire not to be hospitalized, and there was no demonstrated legal basis for holding him against his will.

Furthermore, the Court would note that any predicted hospitalization would not have evidently made Lance's suicide unlikely, as there was no testimony to this effect that met the standards of proof necessary for legal causation. The Court would also emphasize that Lance displayed no unusual conduct following his discharge and that none of his family or friends expressed concern or believed further treatment was mandatory. The Court would thus project that Lance’s post-discharge assurances and the absence of alarming behavior would negate the impact of the health care providers’ conduct on his death.

Given these considerations, the Supreme Court would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, predicting that it would render judgment for the health care providers due to insufficiency of evidence concerning proximate causation.
