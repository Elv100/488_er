Background:
Appellant employees Joe Garcia, Francisco Salinas, and Guadalupe Salinas were injured (or killed, in the case of Salinas) when they fell from a scaffold having a hoisting mechanism belonging to appellee manufacturer, Sky Climber, which was leased to appellant employer (Texas Concrete Silo Company). The accident occurred on July 24, 1967, while they were sealing concrete blocks on a silo using this scaffold with a hoisting mechanism for elevation. The scaffold belonged to Silo Builders, Inc., but the hoisting mechanism belonged to Sky Climber and was attached to the top of the silo by a "sky hook." Garcia and Salinas were on the scaffold when the wire rope unraveled, and they fell to the ground. The wire rope was relatively new, and defects such as kinks, bird-cages, or fish hooks were considered extremely dangerous as they could jam or break the rope.

The employees originally sued on theories including that the hoisting mechanism got caught and tore apart the good condition rope or that it was a strict liability theory of design defect. They suggested a fail-safe inertia type braking system could have been designed to prevent such accidents. The jury's answers were inconsistent; they found the device was not unfit for use, but the design was defective and negligently so, although not a proximate cause of the accident. The jury also found various other elements related to the use of safety belts and failure to warn of damaged cables, alongside determinations of damages for both injured and deceased employees' families.

During the trial, certain instructions that the court gave to the jury were challenged by the appellants. They contended that these instructions were not accurate for a strict liability case, were an improper general charge, and constituted a comment on the evidence, which was impermissible. There were also complaints about the testimony of a witness, Dye, regarding statements made by Kenneth Perry, the foreman, which were considered hearsay and not a declaration against interest that could be admissible. Furthermore, the appellants challenged the admissibility of the wire rope presented at trial due to questions about its chain of possession and whether it was tampered with, as well as particular special issues submitted to the jury related to proximate cause.

Appellant employer Texas Concrete Silo Company, was involved due to an indemnity clause in the lease agreement with Sky Climber, requiring them to indemnify Sky Climber for the costs in defending the suit, including attorney’s fees and court costs.

Verdict:
The court, in its reasoning, will affirm the judgment as to appellant employer Texas Concrete Silo Company, acknowledging the indemnity clauses within the lease agreement to hold Sky Climber harmless from any claim, which includes costs incurred in defending itself against lawsuits. The indemnity provisions are sufficiently broad and detailed, indicating appellant employer’s full liability for any loss, expense, or damage sustained by appellee. The evidence presented sustains this holding to indemnify, including a precedent that attorney's fees and court costs are typically covered under general indemnity agreements. 

Regarding appellant employees, the court is likely to reverse and remand based on the improper jury instruction given by the trial court. The instruction on the law was too general, not properly limited to strict liability issues, and could be seen to bias the jury against the appellants' case. The instruction likely prejudiced one of the parties (the appellants) and was an impermissible comment on the evidence. The trial court’s error in providing unnecessary comments directed the jury's attention too specifically, leading to informed speculation that these comments influenced the jury's conflicted resolutions. 

Additionally, the court will find that the admission of testimony considered hearsay was not justified as a prior inconsistent statement of a witness (as the witness was not confronted with the statement) nor as a declaration against interest, as there was no evidence that the declarant had authority to bind the company. 

Also, probable speculation suggests that the court will agree with the appellants that no proper chain of custody or identity was established for the wire rope presented at trial, and, as such, it should not have been admitted without confirming it was the same rope involved in the accident, and unaltered.

Furthermore, it can be predicted that the court will side with the appellants on the applicability of strict liability to the case regarding a product's defective design, following reasoning from adherent states and supported by legal precedents. This will entail validating the arguments that the product was defective and thus unreasonably dangerous to the users, warranting a reversal due to errors in jury instructions related to these points.

The result will be an intricate consideration of legal principles, errors in the initial trial, and implications of the lease agreement terms, leading to the affirmation of the employer's judgement for indemnity and a reversal and remand for the appellants (Garcia and the Salinas estate) on the basis of improperly admitted evidence, incorrect jury instructions, and the misapplication of the law regarding strict liability in defective design.
