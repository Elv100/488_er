Background:
Appellant, Dr. Hans Wendenburg, is challenging the judgment made by the 215th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which favored appellees Suzanne and Rickie Williams in a medical malpractice action. The appellees initiated the lawsuit following an incident where Dr. Wendenburg perforated Suzanne Williams' iliac artery and iliac vein during her lumbar laminectomy surgery. At the original trial, the jury was given a res ipsa loquitur instruction, which can infer negligence when an injury occurs under circumstances that usually do not happen without negligence, and the defendant had exclusive control over the cause. The trial resulted in the jury finding in favor of the appellees, concluding the appellant's negligence caused Mrs. Williams' injuries.

Dr. Wendenburg does not dispute the perforation of Mrs. Williams’ blood vessels but argues that it did not result from his negligence. The case turned on the applicability of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine. The doctrine’s use is limited in medical malpractice cases per Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4590i, § 7.01 (1989), and only applies in scenarios where the nature of the alleged malpractice and resulting injuries are sufficiently obvious for laymen to understand without expert testimony. Texas courts had recognized exceptions for instances such as operating on the wrong part of the body, mishandling of mechanical instruments, or leaving surgical instruments or sponges inside a patient.

The appellees argued that res ipsa loquitur was applicable for two reasons: Dr. Wendenburg performed surgery on the wrong part of the body and used a mechanical instrument (a pituitary rongeur) during the procedure. Both Dr. Wendenburg and another expert witness, Dr. Robert Grossman, testified that the iliac artery and iliac vein are in proximity to where the surgery was correctly performed, indicating no operation on the wrong part of the body took place. Regarding the use of the pituitary rongeur, the court noted that proper use of such an instrument is beyond layman’s common knowledge, and extensive training is required.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the lower court's judgment against Dr. Wendenburg, as the trial court committed reversible error in submitting the negligence issue with a res ipsa loquitur instruction. The verdict is based on finding that neither of the cited exceptions for the application of res ipsa loquitur—operating on the wrong body part and injury due to a mechanical instrument—are applicable in this case. The appellant had not intentionally operated on an incorrect body part, as the injured blood vessels were adjacent to the surgical site. Moreover, the pituitary rongeur used is a sophisticated tool requiring specific training, making its use not within the purview of laymen's understanding.

Although the court will conclude that the res ipsa loquitur instruction should not have been included, they will also observe that there was some evidence present that could be indicative of negligence. An example of this includes Dr. Wendenburg's admission of the rareness of the injury and a statement he made post-surgery which could reflect an acknowledgment of a mistake. Thus, while the res ipsa loquitur instruction was an error, it does not warrant rendering judgment in favor of the appellant due to the existence of some evidence suggesting negligence. Instead, the court will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial based on standard negligence principles without the res ipsa loquitur instruction, giving due consideration to all evidence, including the doctor's own statements about the procedure's rarity and the mistake made.
