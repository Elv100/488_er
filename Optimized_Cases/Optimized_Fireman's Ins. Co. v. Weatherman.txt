Background:
The plaintiff insured sought recovery on an insurance policy after a windstorm struck his car while driving near Colorado City, Texas, causing the car to go off-road and crash into a post, resulting in substantial damage. The jury found that there was indeed a windstorm that proximately caused damage to the insured's car. Based on this finding and an agreement on the amount of damage ($850.00), the trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. 

The insurance company defendant appealed, raising questions about the trial court’s definition of "windstorm" and whether the evidence and definition fit within the terms and meaning of the policy. The defendant challenged the trial court's definition, which didn't incorporate the element of wind with "unusual, tumultuous violence" often with little or no rainfall. The defendant also argued that the policy excluded loss caused by a collision with another object, suggesting the damage was caused by such a collision rather than a windstorm.

The plaintiff provided evidence through deposition and testimony, corroborated by his wife, that a windstorm blew the car from the road and directly into the post. There was no dispute over the facts, primarily the issue was the definition of "windstorm." Appellate courts from other jurisdictions defined "windstorm" as a wind of unusual violence without necessarily including rainfall. The policy had two relevant provisions: Coverage W excluding loss caused by collision except for exceptions such as windstorm, and Coverage F-1 covering loss due to windstorm regardless of rainfall.

Verdict:
The verdict of this case will affirm the judgment of the trial court based on several key points. The definition of "windstorm" given by the trial court will be considered sufficient to qualify the event that caused the damage as within the policy's coverage. The evidence presented showed that the windstorm was of sufficient violence and tumultuous force to be deemed a "storm."

Despite the defendant's objections to the trial court's definition lacking the element of "wind with unusual, tumultuous violence," the appellate court will find this unnecessary for the definition of a windstorm within the given policy context. Moreover, the observed variations in windstorm characteristics across different regions and the presence (or absence) of rainfall will be seen as irrelevant to the policy coverage determination under these circumstances.

The damage to the car will be considered to have been proximately caused by the windstorm, as the wind was the moving cause of the accident, and the collision with the post was incidental and not the original cause of the damage. Additionally, the court will determine that appellant’s contentions of the damage being caused by a "collision with another object" are not supported by the evidence and are not upheld by the provisions of the policy that clearly state windstorm damage is not regarded as a loss caused by collision or upset.

Therefore, given the findings of the jury and the evidence being uncontradicted and supported by testimony, the court will conclude that the loss was caused by the windstorm as defined by the trial court and covered under the policy, and will overrule the defendant's objections and theories as they do not align with the evidence presented. Hence, the trial court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiff will be affirmed.
