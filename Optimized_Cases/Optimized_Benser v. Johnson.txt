Background:
Appellant, Albert Benser, doing business as Carrier Square Apartments, seeks review of a decision by the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, which ruled in favor of appellee, Cynthia Johnson, and her daughter in an apartment premises negligence lawsuit. On February 1, 1983, Cynthia Johnson and her daughter moved into the appellant's apartment complex and soon discovered that the locks on their living room and bedroom windows were broken. She reported this issue to the management, who provided her with "screw-type" locks for both windows and a stick to secure one window. However, these measures were inadequate as the new locks did not function properly. On February 18, 1984, an intruder drilled a small hole in the living-room window, removed the stick, and entered the apartment due to the non-working lock. The intruder then raped Mrs. Johnson in the presence of her daughter. Mrs. Johnson subsequently filed a negligence lawsuit against Mr. Benser for failing to provide proper locks and security for her apartment. The jury ruled in her favor.

At trial, evidence demonstrated the appellant's knowledge of the broken locks and refusal to install working replacements, despite being aware that the complex was in a high-crime area and had experienced previous criminal activities. A police officer testified that the presence of the stick in the window could indicate to an intruder that the window was vulnerable, potentially inviting unlawful entry.

The jury was required to consider cause in fact and foreseeability to establish proximate cause. The case law suggests that a landlord may be liable if their negligence creates an opportunity for crime that is foreseeable. Federal and state court decisions in similar cases were reviewed, and they supported the premises that landlords can be held accountable for negligence that leads to criminal acts such as break-ins when they fail to take reasonable security measures, especially in high crime areas or in light of previous criminal activity on the premises.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment as the jury's findings are not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence to the extent of being manifestly unjust. It is foreseeable that a landlord's failure to maintain secure locks, especially in a high-crime area with a history of criminal activity, could lead to criminal conduct such as burglary or assault. The appellant's prolonged negligence concerning broken locks, despite repeated complaints and awareness of the crime risks, will be considered a substantial factor in the harm suffered by the appellees. The jury could rightfully conclude that the negligence in maintaining building security directly contributed to the criminal act and the subsequent injuries sustained by the appellees.

Given the presented evidence and findings from similar cases, the court will deem the appellant's inaction to provide functional locks as the proximate cause of the appellee's injuries. Consequently, the court will find that the appellant's negligence facilitated the intruder's entry and the subsequent criminal act, upholding the trial court's ruling in favor of the appellee for damages sustained from the incident.
