Background:
The appellant, a telephone company, was engaged in a legal dispute with an appellee, a telephone company customer, following an incident where the customer's wife was struck by lightning. The incident occurred in the presence of a storm, where lightning flashed in a room, striking the customer's wife who was found unconscious with burns on her body near the telephone. The telephone was nonfunctional post-incident, indicating the lightning may have traveled through the telephone wires. The appellee's family rushed to get medical help using a neighbor's telephone since their own was incapacitated.

The central issue of the case rested upon the telephone company's alleged negligence in failing to install a "ground-connection" on the telephone's arrester device. It was contended that the absence of a ground wire permitted lightning to enter the customer's house through the telephone wires, causing injury. During the trial, the jury, after considering evidence, concluded that the lack of a grounding connection constituted negligence by the telephone company and that a ground wire was ordinarily installed by telephone companies when setting up a residence connection.

The company had admitted to the absence of a ground-connection at the customer's residence but appealed the case, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict. The arguments encompassed the unpredictability of electricity’s behavior, the actual cause of the wife's injuries, the expert testimony regarding the movement of electric currents, and the possibility of the injuries not being the proximate result of the telephone company's negligence.

The telephone company also disputed the admissibility of certain testimony, particularly from witnesses lacking credentials as experts in electricity, and from an exchange with a telephone operator after the accident, whose remarks were argued to be outside the scope of their knowledge and duties.

Other pillars of dissent included the contention that the claims regarding the wife's injuries, including an allegation of a diminution in her hearing, were insufficiently pleaded, hence testimony on that matter was inadmissible. These legal arguments were contrasted with observations suggesting that certain aspects of the accident’s repercussions, such as the damage sustained by the telephone equipment, the lightning's points of contact, and the physical manifestation of injuries, supported the appellee's position.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. The verdict will be sustained based on the reasonableness of the jury's findings regarding the telephone company's negligence in not installing a ground wire, which is typically provided to prevent the kind of accident that occurred. Despite the telephone company’s assertions to the contrary, the evidence presented, including physical facts, will be considered sufficiently convincing and consistent with the jury’s conclusions.

The court will address the sufficiency of the evidence by highlighting that the expert testimonies and the inconclusive nature of electric behavior do not decisively counter evidence showing the direct connection between the lack of a ground wire and the injury sustained. Testimonies contradicting the impact and permanence of the wife's injuries will be deemed as challenged by her own accounts and corroborating evidence demonstrating her substantial suffering and the serious after-effects of the shock, which can reasonably include impaired hearing.

The court will dismiss objections to witness qualifications as matters of discretion for the trial judge, who did not appear to abuse such discretion in this case. Testimony from the telephone operator will be admitted as part of the immediate aftermath, serving as a relevant account of the telephone line’s condition during the accident, which is likely to have been within his professional purview.

Additionally, any concerns regarding the inclusion of the wife's hearing loss in the damages will be set aside, as the court will interpret the general claims of 'serious, painful and permanent bodily injuries' sufficiently broad to encompass unlisted specific injuries, or deem the testimony permissible to rebut claims against the severity or existence of the injuries.

In conclusion, the court will reject the telephone company’s challenge which centers on the theory that the lightning arrester's design and functionality, exclusive of a ground wire, would preempt liability. This position will be considered to overlook critical evidence that highlights the ground wire's role in the device’s effectiveness in preventing electrical injury.

Therefore, the affirmation of the trial court's decision will endorse the jury's findings that the lack of a proper ground wire was indeed negligent, that such negligence was a cause of the wife's injuries, and that a ground wire could have functionally mitigated the electrical current, thus preventing harm. The company's writ of error will be refused, finalizing the decision in favor of the appellee.
