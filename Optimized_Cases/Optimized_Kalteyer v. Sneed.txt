Background:
Alicean R. Kalteyer and her husband Charles F. Kalteyer filed a medical malpractice action against Dr. Dennis R. Sneed, alleging injuries resulting from a corticosteroid injection and an X-ray administered in April 1988. The treatment in question was noted to have followed a previous adverse reaction that Ms. Kalteyer experienced from a similar steroid injection given by a different doctor. Her aversion to injections and adverse reactions to medications were documented, along with treatment for other medical issues. The Kalteyers asserted that Ms. Kalteyer experienced numbness and difficulty walking after the shot on April 15 and developed numerous symptoms after the X-ray on April 29, including eye problems, discoloration, hair loss, and other discomforts.

The lawsuit was filed in June 1990. The appellants sought multiple postponements, and Dr. Sneed eventually filed a motion for summary judgment on June 11, 1990. This was granted on August 5, 1991. The Kalteyers filed a motion for a new trial, arguing expert testimony was not necessary to counter the summary judgment, which was denied, as well as two amended motions for a new trial that were also deemed untimely and hence denied. The Kalteyers contended that the trial court erred by not considering their motions and by granting Dr. Sneed's motion for summary judgment, alleging that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should apply and raise an issue of fact regarding negligence.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment awarded to Dr. Dennis R. Sneed. The reasoning for this verdict will be that although the application of res ipsa loquitur might suggest an issue of fact concerning negligence, it is insufficient to establish proximate cause between the treatments and the resulting injuries. The court is predicted to highlight that expert evidence is essential to demonstrate a causal connection between the medical treatment and the adverse effects experienced by the patient. Simply put, an expert's evaluation of the medical records could reveal that the treatment could not have caused the reported symptoms, making the lay evaluation submitted by the appellants inadequate. 

Additionally, the denial of the appellants' motions for a new trial will be justified based on procedural grounds, namely that they were untimely under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(b)), thus the trial court did not act in an abuse of discretion. The court is likely to stress that any amended motion filed after the 30-day period, but within the trial court's plenary power, would rely on the court's willingness to consider it for guidance, which did not happen in this case. Even if the motions could be filed later with the court's leave, they were not, and the substantive rulings by the trial court on these motions were consistent with established legal precedents. Therefore, the appellants' points of error will be overruled, and the original judgment in favor of appellee Dr. Sneed will be upheld, based on the reasoning contained within the case details.
