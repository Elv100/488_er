Background:
Plaintiff consumers, here represented collectively as McGuire, filed separate actions against defendants, various alcohol producers and the Distilled Spirits Council (collectively referred to as Seagram), seeking damages for injuries and losses allegedly caused by the addictive nature of alcohol. The plaintiffs invoked several legal theories, such as negligence, breaches of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness, conspiracy, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

In their complaints, McGuire outlined a multitude of ways in which Seagram allegedly failed to warn consumers about the dangers of alcohol, arguing Seagram should have provided information on alcohol being a depressant, its toxicity to bodily organs, the potential for addiction, and the various health issues associated with excessive consumption. Separate claims were made asserting that Seagram had a duty to warn because the dangers of alcohol consumption were not commonly known to an ordinary consumer.

Moreover, the plaintiffs pointed to the Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 402A (1965), which deals with strict liability of the seller for selling a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer, claiming that the defendants did not offer sufficient warnings or instructions for the safe use of their alcoholic products.

Seagram's defense primarily rested on the argument that the dangers associated with alcohol consumption were common knowledge and therefore there was no duty to warn the public about them. Additionally, multiple special exceptions argued that the lawsuit lacked a legal basis, was not supportable by the law of strict product liability, and that a product legally manufactured and safe for consumption in limited amounts could not expose the manufacturer to strict product liability.

The 58th District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, agreed with the defendants' arguments, sustaining the special exceptions and dismissing the plaintiffs' actions with prejudice, a decision that prompted the plaintiffs to appeal.

Verdict:
The appellate court held that in deciding the case, it was required to accept all of the allegations and material facts contained within the plaintiffs' petitions as true. Based on this assumption, the court found that the plaintiffs' pleadings did indeed state a cause of action under both negligence and strict liability theories and thus the dismissal with prejudice by the district court based on the special exceptions was improper.

The appellate court was to address whether there existed a legal duty on behalf of the alcohol producers and the distilled spirits council to warn consumers about the dangers of alcohol. It was to determine if the common knowledge argument presented by the defendants was a sufficient defense to the failure to warn claims. The court might explore whether beverage alcohol, given its addictive qualities and potential health risks as pleaded by McGuire, could be deemed an unreasonably dangerous product requiring warnings beyond what might be commonly known. 

The court would consider the advancements in scientific knowledge regarding the effects of alcohol, and whether this knowledge imposed a duty on the manufacturers to warn the general public, specifically those potentially genetically predisposed to alcoholism or unaware of alcohol's addictive nature. It was likely to evaluate the alleged negligence of Seagram in failing to provide adequate warnings and instructions for safe consumption of their products, thus rendering these products unreasonably dangerous.

If the product's dangerousness due to inadequate warnings and the failure to instruct as to safe use was established by the plaintiffs, this could potentially render the product defective under strict liability principles. For McGuire's claims based on misrepresentation, the court would have to decide if justifiable reliance on Seagram's advertisements led to McGuire's injuries.

Considering these factors, the court would have concluded that McGuire stated valid legal claims, reversing the lower court's judgment and remanding the case for trial. At trial, the plaintiffs would then have the opportunity to present evidence to support the allegations in their petitions and seek remedies for any actionable injuries. The appellate court was to reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.

Consequently, the predictions about the verdict are that the appellate court would likely have found that the district court erred in dismissing the case with prejudice and that a more comprehensive examination of the factual allegations and the applicability of legal theories was warranted. However, whether the plaintiffs' evidence would have been sufficient to prevail in a trial remained to be seen, as the decision was to be based on the evidence presented and not just the pleadings.
