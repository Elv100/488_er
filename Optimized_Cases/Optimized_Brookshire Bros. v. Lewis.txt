Background:
Carl Dean Lewis ("Lewis") began working for Brookshire Brothers, Inc. ("Brookshire") in 1984, initially as a meat cutter and later as head meat cutter and meat market manager. On July 9, 1990, while working in the meat department of one of Brookshire's grocery stores, he sustained a back injury by lifting a sausage case, resulting in a herniated disc that required back surgery. Following his recovery and return to light duty work on October 8, 1990, Lewis suffered a second back injury on June 10, 1991, while the meat department was short-staffed and the store was having a ground beef sale. The second injury led to another herniated disc and a second surgery on September 24, 1991. In January 1992, despite severe pain and the need for a third surgery, Lewis returned to work with a "pencil and paper" light duty restriction.

During the trial, evidence was presented regarding Brookshire's alleged negligence. Testimonies highlighted Brookshire's awareness of inadequate support staff in the meat department and the risks associated with overworking the remaining employees. Specific issues included the danger of regularly lifting heavy lugs of meat, with some lugs weighing as much as 70 to 75 pounds and the process requiring lifting above shoulder level. Experts testified about the lack of specific safety instructions and the unsafe equipment, particularly the uncomfortable height of the grinder and the weight of the lugs.

The court found that Brookshire, a nonsubscriber under the Texas workers' compensation law, was responsible for work-related injuries under common law principles of negligence and that comparative negligence was inapplicable as a defense in this situation. The case went to a jury, and damages totaling $300,000 were awarded. Brookshire appealed the decision of the 221st District Court, Montgomery County, Texas, resulting in this review.

Verdict:
The appellate court affirmed the award of damages to Lewis for several reasons. First, Brookshire's negligence in failing to provide adequate staff support and ensuring a safe work environment was a proximate cause of Lewis's injuries. Given the evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that the inadequate staffing led to an overburdened Lewis, who had to perform unsafe job activities under risky conditions. In addition, the court acknowledged that while Brookshire contended that Lewis performed usual and customary work, the circumstances of the day of injury—with an ongoing sale and staff shortages—made the danger foreseeable and the injury reasonably anticipated.

As Brookshire was a nonsubscriber to the Texas workers' compensation law, comparative negligence was not an applicable defense, so the trial court correctly did not reduce the award based on Lewis's alleged contributory negligence. The court further held that sufficient evidence supported Lewis's claim for both past and future physical impairment, and thus Brookshire's claims concerning lack of evidence for mental anguish were without merit. Brookshire also failed to substantiate its claim for offset of damages and showed no error in the trial court's decision to refuse certain jury instructions, which were deemed unnecessary and potentially confusing.

Finally, the court found no basis to grant Brookshire's request for a remittitur as it did not align with the claims made during the trial proceedings. All of Brookshire's challenges to the trial court's decisions were overruled, resulting in the upholding of the jury's damages award to Lewis.
