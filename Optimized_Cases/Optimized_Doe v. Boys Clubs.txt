Background:
The case involves appellants, who are minors and their relatives, seeking a writ of error to review a judgment from the Texas Court of Appeals for the Seventh District, which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellee, a boys club. The appellants had sued the boys club for negligence and deceptive trade practices after a volunteer at the club sexually abused the appellant minors on outings that were not sponsored by the club.

Boyd Ray Mullens, the volunteer, had been convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) twice before volunteering at the Boys Club in Mesquite, Texas. The Boys Club did not conduct a thorough investigation or screen Mullens’ application, which led to him volunteering and later sexually abusing the appellant minors during non-club outings. The plaintiffs are the minor Coe brothers, their grandparents and guardians Mr. and Mrs. Coe, the minor C.G. Doe, and his mother Ms. C.J. Doe. The Coes enrolled their grandchildren in the club, after being assured by the club’s education director that the volunteers were "checked out thoroughly."

Mrs. V.M. Coe, before allowing Mullens to take her grandsons camping, asked club personnel about him and was told that "he seemed to be okay" without revealing his status as a court-referred probationer. The trial court granted the Boys Club’s motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding there was no proximate cause for negligence and no producing cause for the Deceptive Trade and Practices Act (DTPA) claims.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court’s ruling, finding that the appellants failed to demonstrate key elements of each of their claims against the Boys Club, specifically in establishing both proximate and producing cause. It is reasoned that even if the Boys Club had a duty to investigate volunteers, and indeed breached it, this breach was not the factual cause of the appellants' injuries. There is no evidence suggesting that knowledge of Mullens’ past DWI convictions would have changed the club's decision to accept him as a volunteer or would have allowed the Boys Club to foresee his assaults on the children.

Moreover, the court will hold that while the Boys Club's education director knew Mullens was a court-referred probationer, this fact was not disclosed to the appellants during a time that could be considered part of a "transaction" under the DTPA, hence it cannot constitute a failure to disclose under the Act. Furthermore, even if there had been misrepresentations about investigating volunteers, the appellants' own investigation and the nature of the relationship developed between the Coes and Mullens sever the causal connection to the Boys Club's statements as a substantial factor in the resulting injuries.

Because the appellants cannot establish that the Boys Club's conduct was a substantial factor in the injuries without which the harm would not have occurred, nor can they show that the Boys Club could have reasonably anticipated the assaults from Mullens based on the provided information, the court will determine that there is no proximate cause in the negligence claims or producing cause in the DTPA claims. Hence, the summary judgment in favor of the appellee will be justified and affirmed.
