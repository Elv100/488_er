Background:
Appellant employer (Texas Farm Products Company) sought review of a judgment from the 145th Judicial District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, which entered in favor of appellee employee (Paul Stock) for personal injuries he sustained during the course of his employment. Stock slipped and fell on grease at his workplace, resulting in injuries, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against the employer. The trial court, based on jury findings, granted Stock a judgment for money damages totaling $219,670.

Stock was a 54-year-old mechanic employed by the non-subscriber employer to a policy of worker's compensation insurance under the Texas Worker's Compensation Act, which makes the employer subject to enhanced liabilities. On February 27, 1980, upon entering his work stall, he slipped on a patch of grease. Another employee observed the grease spot after the fall. Stock was hospitalized under Dr. Anthony W. Jorgenson's care and diagnosed with a rare bone disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, making his bones prone to fractures and deformities under ordinary conditions. He also suffered from a compression fracture of his second lumbar vertebrae (L-2), which did not aggravate his pre-existing condition but caused pain and was disabled due to the pain stemming from nerve root pressure.

Stock's injuries included past and future pain and mental anguish, loss of earnings, earning capacity, physical impairment, and medical expenses. The employer argued a series of points of error, including that it didn't owe a duty to Stock to keep the floor free of grease, that there was insufficient evidence for the submission of special issues to the jury, that jury findings related to the presence of grease on the floor and the employer's knowledge of it were unsupported by evidence, and that the damages were excessive. The employer also contended that Stock's counsel's misconduct during the trial prejudiced the jury.

Verdict:
The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the employer was liable for actionable negligence due to failure to maintain a safe work environment and for knowing that the grease had been on the floor for a sufficient amount of time for any reasonable employee to have discovered and remedied the situation, given that the employer did not have a clean-up crew or inspect work areas between shifts.

The trial court did not err in overruling the motion for an instructed verdict as sufficient evidence raised the issue of actionable negligence on the employer's part. The jury findings were sufficient to establish liability, and any errors in instructions to the jury were considered harmless considering supporting jury findings on other issues. The misconduct of Stock's counsel, though improper, was found to be rendered harmless by the trial court's prompt admonition to disregard and was insufficient to show that it caused an improper judgment.

The court would conclude that damages for past and future physical impairment were excessive and will require a remittitur (a reduction of the amount of damages awarded by the jury) to affirm the judgment. Should the appellee file a written remittitur in the specified amount (reduced by $39,370) within a given timeframe, the judgment will be affirmed; otherwise, it will be reversed and remanded for a new trial due to the excessive damages initially awarded. The court will recognize the employer's liability for negligence, but conditionally affirm the ruling with the adjustment of damages.
