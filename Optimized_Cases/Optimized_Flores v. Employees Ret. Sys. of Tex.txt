Background:
Henrietta Flores, the appellant, served as an aide to social workers at the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services for nearly fifteen years. Her primary job was to transport children to various appointments, which involved driving up to twelve hours a day. She was involved in a car accident while on duty, which caused her to suffer back and knee injuries, leading to two surgeries that left her permanently disabled.

Flores was ultimately dismissed from her job due to her inability to perform her duties, and she subsequently applied for occupational disability retirement benefits from the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS), which provides a retirement system for incapacitated state employees. Her application was denied on the basis that her disability did not meet the statutory definition of an occupational disability according to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 811.001(12).

Flores appealed, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) found in her favor, recommending that occupational disability benefits be granted. However, the Board of Trustees for ERS reversed the ALJ's decision and denied the benefits, which was subsequently affirmed by the District Court of Travis County. Flores then appealed the manner of the Board's decision and its interpretation of section 811.001(12).

The Board specifically rejected the ALJ's conclusion that the accident was a hazard peculiar to Flores's job and that her preexisting conditions did not preclude compensation. The ALJ had found that the injury directly resulted from a risk inherent in Flores's state employment and that her disability was not solely caused by the incident without regard to preexisting conditions. Despite Flores contending that the Board arbitrarily applied a new policy without notice, the Board and the trial court disagreed, which led to the current appeal.

Verdict:
The appellate court will predict that the judgment of the trial court and order of the Board will be reversed. It will determine that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously due to several reasons: its prior decisions were not respected, there was a failure to comply with statutory authorizations and administrative rules, a lack of due process was apparent in the Board's decision-making procedure, and it changed findings and conclusions for unauthorized and unexplained reasons without adequate record support.

Furthermore, the appellate court will find that the Board's interpretation of section 811.001(12) was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. The court will conclude that the legislature intended for the term "occupational disability" to mean that an employee’s disability must primarily be caused by an injury arising from their state employment, and that a preexisting condition that becomes symptomatic only due to the injury should not prevent the awarding of benefits. The court will determine that "risk or hazard peculiar to a duty" encompasses increased risks inherent to job duties that are distinct from risks encountered by the general public. As Flores's duty as an aide significantly increased her risk of an accident, which ultimately led to her injury, her disability will be considered as resulting from a risk peculiar to her employment.

Thus, the court will reverse the lower court and Board decisions and remand the case back to the Board with instructions to proceed in a manner consistent with their newly established interpretation of the statute.
