Background:
Plaintiffs, composed of a temporary administrator, the surviving minor child, and others, sued defendant oil companies—Tex-Jersey Oil Corporation and Great Expectations Oil Company—after three decedents, Christine Beck and her two children Lorenzo and Elizabeth Beck, perished in a fire caused by an explosion of an oil storage tank. The tank was struck by lightning, leading to a fire that spread to the decedents' home, situated approximately 50 feet away. The decedents suffered pain and died as a result of the burns.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants negligently maintained the storage tanks by storing crude oil in tanks that were not vapor-proof and had open holes in the top. This, according to the plaintiffs, was a violation of Kilgore, Texas, General Oil Ordinance § 13, which stipulates that storage tanks must be vapor-proof and adequately connected to a foam generator. Plaintiffs argued that these negligent actions were the proximate cause of the deaths of Christine Beck and her children.

Evidence presented at trial showed that the tank was not vapor-proof, as admitted by Tex-Jersey and partially conceded by Great Expectations. Testimonies described that a vapor-proof tank is one that controls vapor release to prevent escape into the atmosphere. The jury found that the oil storage tanks had open holes, which contributed to the ignition by lightning, and that the defendants’ negligence was a proximate cause of the subsequent deaths. Other findings of the jury included that the accident was neither due to an act of God nor an unavoidable accident, and that specific amounts for damages were deemed fair for the survivor and for the pain and suffering of the decedents.

The defendants challenged the decision, arguing that the fire and explosion were caused by lightning, an act of God, and that the condition of the tank did not affect the inevitability of the tragedy. They also argued against the validity of the Kilgore ordinance and denied responsibility for negligence.

Verdict:
Observing the evidence presented, which included admissions regarding the storage tank's condition, testimonies about industry standards for vapor-proof tanks, and the circumstances of the lightning strike and the ensuing fire, a future court will likely affirm the trial court's ruling. The defendants will be found negligent for failing to abide by the Kilgore ordinance that mandates vapor-proof tanks, which constitutes negligence per se. A detailed interpretation of "vapor-proof" in the oil industry context will support the jury’s findings and the court’s decision that the tank was indeed required to be vapor-proof to prevent such accidents.

The evidence likely demonstrates that escape of gas vapors from the improperly maintained tank was ignited by the lightning, resulting in the deadly explosion and fire. Expert testimony will support the premise that a properly maintained vapor-proof tank would not have exploded upon a lightning strike. The court will reject the defense that the accident was unavoidable or solely attributable to an act of God, as the defendants should have anticipated and mitigated normal natural phenomena through proper tank maintenance.

Considering testimony regarding similar incidents, historical patterns for lightning strikes in the area, and the common knowledge that escaping vapors can be ignited by lightning, the court will likely conclude that the defendants had a duty to foresee such risks and act accordingly to prevent them. As such, it will be determined that the defendants' negligence, in conjunction with the lightning strike, was the proximate cause of death and suffering, thus affirming the trial court’s decision and awarding damages to the plaintiffs in accordance with the jury's findings. The defendants' remaining points will likely be overruled, as they do not present reversible error or sufficiently challenge the findings of law and facts established during the trial.
