Background:
The plaintiff in error (the insurer) issued a one-year fire insurance policy to the defendant in error (Mrs. Mims) on July 2, 1917, covering a one-story brick building in Midland, Texas, for an amount not exceeding $2,500. The insurance policy included an explosion clause that exempted the insurer from liability for loss caused directly or indirectly by an explosion unless a fire ensued, and then only for fire damage. It also included a falling building clause specifying that insurance would cease if a building or any part thereof fell, except as the result of fire.

On May 28, 1918, an explosion occurred in the Westmoreland Building, which was immediately adjacent and adjoining the Mims Building. The explosion, caused by vaporized gasoline, demolished the Westmoreland Building and caused significant damage to the Mims Building. The Mims Building suffered almost complete destruction by the force of the explosion, and fire was present in the building when the first witnesses arrived. The fire damaged the Mims Building to some extent, but the primary damage was from the explosion.

Mrs. Mims sued the insurer to recover the total fire loss under the policy. The trial court awarded the insured the face value of the policy with interest. The insurer appealed the decision, questioning the application of the explosion and falling building clauses given the facts. The trial court had instructed the jury that the defendant was liable if fire caused an explosion that wrecked the Mims Building and that the plaintiff was to be awarded damages if the jury found this to be true.

The appellate court had to decide whether the falling building clause offered a defense against the loss by fire following the explosion, and whether the insurer was liable for damages from the explosion in the adjoining building caused by a fire therein. The burden of proof rested upon Mrs. Mims to show that her loss did not fall within the explosion clause exception.

Verdict:
Anticipating the reasoning for the verdict, the court will reverse the trial court’s decision and remand the action for a retrial, mainly because the falling building clause, when considered in context with the explosion clause, does not present a defense to the loss caused by the fire that ensued after the explosion. The existing legal consensus is that insurance against loss by fire includes all loss from explosions which are the direct result of an antecedent fire upon the insured premises. Since the fall of the Mims Building was caused by an explosion followed by a fire, the insurer is liable for the damage inflicted by the fire, but not for the damage from the explosion.

The appellate court will buttress its reasoning with precedent from similar cases where courts held that an ensuing fire's damages following an explosion led to liability under the explosion clause and the falling clause did not negate this. Such cases include Dows v. Ins. Co., Davis & Co. v. Ins. Co., and Leonard v. Ins. Co.

However, the core issue is whether the damage wrought by an explosion in the Westmoreland Building, caused by antecedent fire therein, falls within the scope of Mrs. Mims' insurance coverage. The appellate court will reason that the policy's explosion clause exempts the insurer from liability for damage caused by such an explosion. The court will consider the explosion as the proximate cause of the damage and the fire in Westmoreland Building as a remote cause. Based on the testimony and facts of the case, the fire originated in the Westmoreland Building and was communicated to the Mims Building by the explosion.

Since Mrs. Mims could not prove that the fire originated in her building, which could have implied that the explosion was caused by the fire on her premises, she failed to carry the burden of proof. The explosion thus remains the proximate cause of most damage, which the policy specifically exempted.

For these reasons, the court will determine that the insurer is liable only for damages caused by the fire following the explosion, not exceeding the policy's face amount. The absence of evidence of the specific amount of fire damage will necessitate the court's decision to reverse the trial court’s verdict and call for a new trial where proper evidence on fire damages can be presented. The other various questions presented by the case will be considered unnecessary for this decision.
