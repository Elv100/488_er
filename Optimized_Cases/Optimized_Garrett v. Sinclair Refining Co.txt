Background:
The appellant, T. L. Garrett, acting as the next friend of his minor daughter, filed a lawsuit against the appellee, Sinclair Refining Company, seeking damages for negligence. Garrett was an employee of Sinclair Refining at their Fort Worth refinery. He alleged that the employer had constructed a rudimentary water closet (toilet) for its employees that lacked a separate urinal and only had a narrow board to sit on, which became filthy and contaminated with gonorrhea germs. Garrett claimed that in using this toilet he contracted gonorrhea and, being unfamiliar with the symptoms and unaware he had the disease, unintentionally infected his minor daughter through the use of the same toilet seat at home and shared towels.

The jury sided with Garrett, finding that Sinclair Refining had been negligent in providing safe toilet facilities, which was a proximate cause of both Garrett's and his daughter's infections. This negligence was not seen as the sole proximate cause, as Garrett's own actions were also found to be negligent and contributing to the infections but similarly not the sole proximate causes. Despite these findings, the trial court granted Sinclair Refining's motion for judgment on the verdict, denying Garrett's motion, and consequently denying the damages initially awarded by the jury. The trial court's decision was based on the reasoning that the employee's subsequent actions of sharing towels and failing to protect his family were not foreseeable by the employer.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment that denied Garrett recovery of damages for his daughter's infection. The court will consider that, even if Garrett contracted the disease due to the employer's negligence, it was not reasonably foreseeable for Sinclair Refining to predict Garrett would subsequently fail to safeguard his own family against the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the court will support its affirmation on the lack of direct evidence that Garrett contracted gonorrhea from the water closet at Sinclair Refining's facility or that the employer knew about the presence of the infection-causing germs on the toilet seat.

In reaching the verdict, the court will rely on the legal principle of foreseeability in negligence cases, noting that not every act of negligence justifies the imposition of damages if there are unforeseen intervening causes contributing to the outcome. The court will assert that the father's duty to protect his family should not have been overridden by his capacity as an employee, and the basic parental instinct to shield his child from harm should have been anticipated. The court will conclude that the employer's negligence at best created the conditions possible for injury but was not the direct cause of the minor daughter's infectionâ€”placing considerable weight on the series of intervening actions by Garrett that were not expected to occur. Additionally, the verdict will be underpinned by the assertion that there is insufficient evidence to establish a reasonable probability that Garrett contracted gonorrhea from the employer's toilet, instead of being based on mere speculation and possibility. The court will reference legal precedents that align with their rationale for foreseeability and the distinction between directly affecting a minor child and a parent's contributory negligence.
