Background:
James Watson was hospitalized at North Hills Hospital on February 23, 1995, for hip surgery, but his health deteriorated leading to further treatments at various facilities, including Transitional Hospital Corporation (THC) and Westpark Nursing Home. Six months later, in August 1995, he was admitted to Watson Memorial Nursing Home. By September 24, 1995, he had to be transported to Harris Methodist Hospital, where doctors observed his dire physical condition. The hospital suspected the neglect and abuse were due to the nursing home, triggering an investigation by the Texas Department of Human Services (TDHS). Watson died on October 2, 1995. 

Surviving children Donna Pack, Ann Bowling, and Linda Pearson filed a lawsuit against Crossroads Evangelism, Inc. d/b/a Watson Memorial Nursing Home and individual staff members, alleging negligence, negligence per se, gross negligence, wrongful death, and other claims, seeking damages under the Texas Survival Statute and the Wrongful Death Act. The jury returned a "take nothing" judgment in favor of Watson Memorial.

Appellants contested various trial court decisions on admissibility of evidence, discovery, expert testimony, and the striking of negligence per se claims. They argued for inclusion of TDHS records beyond those pertaining to Watson to show a pattern of neglect and contested the exclusion of Harris Methodist Hospital records and testimony from Dr. James Cox that might have implied Watson's condition resulted from neglect. They disagreed with the trial court’s refusal to release TDHS photographs of Watson and limitation of nurse Dolores Alford’s expert testimony. Appellants asserted the trial court erred in striking their negligence per se claims and contended that the evidence was factually insufficient to support a verdict for the defense. They also challenged the jury question formulation, which they believed should have included a question on Watson Memorial’s negligence leading to injuries not causing death, relevant to their survival claim.

Verdict:
The trial court's judgment was upheld. The appellate court reasoned that the limitation of TDHS records to those concerning Watson was within the court's discretion as other records did not constitute expert testimony and might have been overly prejudicial. Restrictions on the admissibility of Harris Methodist Hospital records and Dr. James Cox's testimony were deemed non-arbitrary as his conclusions on abuse or neglect were speculative, lacking a basis in fact specific to Watson's experience at the nursing home. The TDHS photographs were considered confidential and not subject to disclosure based on rulings that "reports, records, and working papers," including photographs taken during investigations, were protected from public disclosure. Dolores Alford's qualifications were deemed insufficient to be considered an expert on standards of care, thus her testimony was limited. Negligence per se claims were correctly struck as the cited MLIIA and administrative code did not provide for tort liability in medical malpractice lawsuits. The jury's take nothing verdict was supported by evidence and not manifestly unjust. The trial court did not err in its jury question about negligence leading to death, as the wrongful death and survival actions arose from the same allegations and the evidence of causation was insufficient to support a verdict in favor of the appellants on the survival claim. Moreover, the appellate court presumed in favor of broad-form submission of questions, seeing no reverse error in light thereof, and the totality of circumstances surrounding the charge itself. The appellants' issues were overruled in their entirety, and the take nothing judgment against them was affirmed.
