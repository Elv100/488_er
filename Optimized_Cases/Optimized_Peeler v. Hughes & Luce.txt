Background:
Carol Peeler, the appellant, was an officer at Hillcrest Equities, Inc., a corporation that traded in securities. She and other Hillcrest principals were under federal criminal investigation by the IRS for various offenses. Peeler hired the appellees, attorney Darrell Jordan, and the Hughes & Luce law firm, where Jordan was a partner, and paid a substantial retainer fee. An assistant U.S. Attorney overseeing the investigation offered Peeler transactional immunity in exchange for cooperation, but Jordan did not communicate this offer to Peeler nor respond to the assistant U.S. Attorney. Peeler contends that Jordan's loyalty to other defendants was why the immunity offer was not relayed to her.

Later, a federal grand jury indicted Peeler and others for various offenses, and another suspect who accepted immunity provided information used to prosecute the rest, including Peeler. She pleaded guilty to aiding the preparation of a fraudulent U.S. partnership tax return and was sentenced to probation and a fine. Peeler claimed she entered the guilty plea on the advice of Hughes & Luce lawyers and discovered the immunity offer three days after her plea. Asserting that the failure to communicate the immunity offer caused her indictment and conviction, she sued for damages citing negligence, gross negligence, and a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), as well as breach of contract and breach of implied warranty.

The appellees moved for summary judgment on several grounds, arguing that Peeler would not have received immunity, the offer was unauthorized, for policy reasons her own conduct was the cause of her indictment and conviction, and that Peeler did not seek to withdraw her plea or set aside the conviction. The court ruled in favor of appellees based on policy reasons and the fact that Peeler had not sought postconviction relief prior to the hearing on summary judgment. Peeler's actions were seen as the proximate cause of her injuries, nullifying the alleged malpractice by the appellees. The court dismissed her claims against her defense team and she did not win the breach of contract claim in trial court.

After the judgment, Peeler filed a motion to vacate the judgment on her guilty plea in federal court. On appeal, her grievances included that her conduct was not the exclusive cause of her indictment and conviction; no policy barred her claim; and that innocence or remedy exhaustion were not prerequisites. She also argued that the judgment violated equal protection rights, Texas's open courts provision, and the "outlawry" provision of the Texas Constitution.

Verdict:
The court's future prediction is that it will uphold the summary judgment in favor of the appellees because Peeler cannot establish causation for her malpractice claims until she proves her innocence of the tax fraud charges. The rationale will be that Texas policy and decisions from various state courts emphasize that public policy does not support allowing a criminal defendant to profit from legal malpractice actions without proving their innocence first. This policy rationale is tied to the proposition that a criminal's own actions are the natural and primary cause of any legal consequences they face, including indictments and convictions. Therefore, without establishing her innocence, Peeler cannot convincingly argue that her attorney's failure to communicate an immunity offer was the proximate or producing cause of her damages, as per the usual criteria for legal malpractice cases.

Verdict reasoning would detail that neither negligence nor DTPA claims will stand because the appellant will be unable to demonstrate that her attorney's actions were the proximate (in negligence claims) or producing (in DTPA claims) cause of her damages. The court will reason that requiring proof of innocence or postconviction relief before allowing a malpractice claim against a criminal defense attorney aligns with long-standing legal principles and public policy aimed at preventing financial gain from one’s criminal activity.

The verdict will further clarify that the summary judgment does not violate Peeler's right to equal protection, as she, a criminal defendant, does not belong to a suspect class and the judgment is logically connected to the objectives of the legal system. The judgment also does not breach Texas constitution’s open courts provision since it does not stem from any statutory infringement on a common-law cause of action. Lastly, Peeler’s argument that she is being treated as an outlaw will be dismissed since the judgment does not prevent her from proving her innocence or seeking relief through other legal means; it simply follows policy that prohibits economic benefits from one’s crime for malpractice claims. Therefore, the court's expected determination would be an affirmation of the summary judgment in favor of the law firm and partner, upholding their motion on policy grounds associated with causation, while disregarding other potential grounds for summary judgment.
