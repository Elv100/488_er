Background:
Macedonia Baptist Church (the appellant) has appealed a judgment entered against it, where Nora Gibson (an injured member of the church) and her husband, Milton Gibson (the appellees), recovered damages for injuries sustained by Mrs. Gibson due to a side flash from lightning while she was leaving a worship service. The church began building a new structure in 1984 and ordered a steeple with a lightning rod and cable, intended to protect the building from lightning strikes. The contractor installed the steeple but was dismissed before completing the lightning rod and cable installation, which was then carried out by church members. They deviated from the installation instructions in several ways.

On August 21, 1988, during a lightning storm, Nora Gibson was injured by a side flash caused by lightning striking the rod system as she departed from the church service. The church is a nonprofit membership corporation and argued that it should have defenses from suits by members similar to those of unincorporated associations. This argument was about whether the Gibsons, as members, had standing to sue the church.

The case dealt with several legal questions including standing to sue, the sufficiency of evidence to support the jury’s decision, the exclusion of testimony of an undesignated witness, the propriety of jury argument, and the church's request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The evidence presented at trial showed that the church was aware of prior lightning strikes, that the system was improperly installed near a walkway, and that injuries from a side flash were foreseeable. Expert testimony supported the notion that the improperly installed lightning protection system was the most probable cause of Gibson’s injuries, contrasting with the church's stance that Gibson's injuries were an "act of God." Additionally, the court excluded testimony from a potential witness, Shirley Stark, who was not properly designated before trial and whose knowledge was related to Gibson's proximity to the ground wire at the time of the injury—a crucial detail given that proximity to the wire was necessary for a side flash to cause injury.

Verdict:
The court will uphold the lower court’s judgment in favor of the Gibsons, ruling that they indeed have standing to sue the church despite being members. The verdict will reflect that the injury was not an unavoidable "act of God" but was instead caused by an improperly installed lightning protection system—therefore, a foreseeable risk for which the church was responsible.

The testimony and evidence regarding the installation of the protection system and the conditions leading to the side flash will be deemed factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding that the church’s deviation from the system’s installation plan was negligent and led to Gibson's injuries. An additional factor in the verdict will involve ruling out the church's claim that it cannot be held responsible for acts of God due to the church's human intervention in installing the system and redirecting the lightning path.

Regarding the exclusion of Stark’s testimony, the court will agree with the initial ruling as Stark was not appropriately designated before trial as a witness with knowledge of relevant facts, and no good cause was shown for this oversight.

The jury argument presented by the Gibsons’ attorney may have had instances deemed improper by the court, but the verdict will state that Macedonia Baptist Church did not establish that these errors might have influenced the jury's decision to the extent that they should reverse the judgment.

Lastly, the church’s request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence will be denied because the evidence was not sufficiently material or likely to lead to a different outcome. In sum, the verdict will cite that the church failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion or that the probability of harm from improper jury argument outweighed the grounding of the verdict in the trial evidence. As a result, the church's various contentions will be overruled and the lower court's decision will be affirmed.
