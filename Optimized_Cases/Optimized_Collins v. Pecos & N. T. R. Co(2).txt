Background:
Plaintiff Robert Collins, a railroad employee, sued his employer, Pecos & Northern Texas Railway Company, for injuries resulting from negligent poisoning while handling railroad ties treated with creosote. Collins alleged that the railway company failed to warn him about the dangers of creosote, which led to his permanent injuries. In the District Court of Parmer County, the jury found in favor of Collins, supporting his allegations that he was unaware of the dangerous properties of creosote, which was known or should have been known by the railway company. Evidence supported his claim that he sustained permanent injuries as a proximate result of the poisoning and the railway company’s negligence.

The Court of Civil Appeals, however, overturned the decision, stating that there was no evidence proving that the employer’s negligence was the proximate cause of Collins's permanent injuries. The Appeals Court further stated that permanent injuries could not have been reasonably anticipated and thus the railway company could not be charged with negligence without showing anticipation of such injuries. Collins appealed the decision to the higher court, leading to a further review of the judgment.

Arguments presented by the plaintiff focused on the employer's obligation to warn about potential dangers from contact with wet creosote ties. The defense argued that there was no evidence that handling the ties in usual manners would cause systemic poison. Moreover, it argued that it could not be feasibly anticipated that employees handling the ties would develop systemic poisoning as a result of such contact.

The Commission of Appeals, after reviewing the case, opined that when permanent injuries result from negligence, the wrongdoing party is responsible for all consequences that naturally and proximately flow from said negligence. It asserted that anticipation of precise injuries is not a prerequisite for a duty of care; it's enough if some injury could be reasonably foreseen. The Commission of Appeals also held that whether permanent injuries were a natural and proximate result of the employer's negligence was indeed a question of fact for the jury to decide.

Verdict:
The supreme court will adopt the judgment recommended by the Commission of Appeals. The premise of the verdict is rooted primarily in the fact that negligence was established in relation to potential injuries that may have been foreseen by the employer at the time of misconduct. Even though the specific permanent injuries sustained by Collins were not anticipated, they were nonetheless probable and followed naturally from the railway company’s negligence, without intervening independent causes. It will be determined that the permanent injuries suffered by Collins were the natural and proximate results of the company's failure to warn about the dangers of creosote, pursuant to the testimony and evidence presented. Consequently, the railway company will be held responsible for the full extent of Collins's injuries. The court will overturn the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals and reaffirm the original judgment of the trial court, thereby ruling in favor of Collins. The court will also address any other assignments of error presented by the appellant and find that they do not mandate a reversal of the lower court's decision. The specifics of the court's charge and the special charges requested by the defendant, which were previously in contention, are deemed to have been addressed adequately, further supporting the decision to hold the railway company liable for Collins's permanent injuries.
