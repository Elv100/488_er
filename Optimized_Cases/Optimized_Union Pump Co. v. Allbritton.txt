Background:
Respondent worker Sue Allbritton was injured when she slipped on a pipe rack that was wet from efforts to extinguish a fire at Texaco Chemical Company's facility. The fire originated from a pump manufactured by petitioner manufacturer Union Pump Company. This particular pump had caught fire twice before. During the incident, which occurred on September 4, 1989, Allbritton, having just finished her shift, volunteered to assist in quelling the fire. Following the fire's extinguishment, an issue with a nitrogen purge valve arose, making it seem like an emergency was still ongoing. Allbritton accompanied her supervisor to the valve over the wet and slippery aboveground pipe rack, as opposed to taking a safer, alternative route. After being informed that it was unnecessary to block the valve, they chose to return across the pipe rack, during which Allbritton was injured.

Allbritton sued Union Pump, alleging negligence, gross negligence, and strict liability, claiming the defective pump was a proximate or producing cause of her injuries. She contended that if not for the pump fire, she wouldn't have walked over the pipe rack, which was rendered hazardous due to the firefighting efforts. Union Pump moved for summary judgment, arguing that their conduct or product was not a legal cause of Allbritton's injuries. The trial court granted this summary judgment, which was later reversed and remanded by the court of appeals due to raised issues of fact concerning proximate and producing cause. Union Pump then challenged the court of appeals' judgment.

The overarching legal question pertained to whether the condition, act, or omission that Allbritton complained of was too remote to constitute legal causation. The case centered on the conditions necessary for legal causation, especially whether Union Pump's negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about Allbritton's injury. The case also discussed the elements of negligence and strict liability, the definitions of proximate and producing cause, and summarized judgments from other related cases.

Verdict:
The verdict reasoned that in order for negligence to legally cause another's harm, it must be a substantial factor in causing the injury. The court held that legal causation was not established because Union Pump's conduct or product only created the condition that allowed the injury to occur, not that it substantially caused it. The fire being extinguished and the emergency having abated, Allbritton was no longer operating under the immediate threat of the fire, thus severing the legal causative link between the fire and her later choice to traverse the pipe rack unsafely.

The circumstances of the injury being indirectly connected with Union Pump's conduct or product were deemed too remote to constitute legal causation. Therefore, the court predicted it would reverse the decision of the court of appeals and render judgment for Union Pump, directing that Allbritton take nothing. The projected reasoning was that the condition created by the fire was simply a backdrop and the fire's immediate effects had ceased by the time of Allbritton's injury, making her actions and the conditions of the pipe rack, not the pump fire, the direct causes of her injury. Additional discussion by Justice Cornyn, in concurrence, contemplated the causes in a broader legal context, including the nuances of cause-in-fact versus proximate cause, emphasizing the need for a clear causal link and policy-based reasons for limiting liability. Meanwhile, Justice Spector, dissenting, believed the emergency situation from the fire had not fully resolved, and that causation was not negated to a degree warranting summary judgment.
