Background:
Marcos Rios was employed by A Guardian Angel Child Care Center, Inc. (the "Appellant") as a van driver whose job was to transport children to and from the daycare center. On January 28, 2013, Rios was exposed to fumes from a fire extinguisher that accidentally discharged in the vehicle. Following this incident, Rios began experiencing respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, a scratchy throat, and ultimately respiratory failure, leading to Rios requiring a permanent tracheostomy. Rios subsequently sued his employer for negligence, claiming that the facility's failure to properly secure the fire extinguisher, lack of employee training, and provision of an unsafe workplace caused his injuries. At trial, Rios provided lay testimony about the accident and his resultant symptoms, but did not present expert medical testimony explicitly linking his medical conditions to the fire extinguisher incident. He also introduced his medical records and bills, attributing the entirety of his medical expenses to the incident without segregating charges for respiratory care from other treatments. Rios won at trial, with the jury awarding him damages that included full compensation for past medical expenses, mental anguish, disfigurement, lost earnings, and lost earning capacity.

Verdict:
The appellate court reversed the trial court’s judgment and concluded that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's finding that the fire extinguisher incident caused all of Rios’s claimed medical expenses. Expert medical testimony was necessary to establish proximate causation for many of the medical conditions and treatments, particularly since Rios was diagnosed with and treated for multiple chronic health conditions unrelated to respiratory issues. The court looked favorably upon the evidence relating to the time period between January 28, 2013, and February 28, 2013, during which Rios received treatment for his respiratory problems, assessing that only those conditions commonly known to relate to respiratory distress could be causally linked to the incident based on lay testimony. The court also noted that Rios's medical records did not segregate charges directly caused by the fire extinguisher incident from charges for other treatments or illnesses. As a result, it was nearly impossible for a jury to accurately determine which medical expenses were directly tied to Rios's respiratory issues resulting from the fire extinguisher exposure. Therefore, while the lay testimony supported some damages, the absence of expert medical testimony rendered the lay testimony legally insufficient to support the full amount awarded by the jury for past medical expenses.

Given that there was evidence to support some damages, the court indicated that Rios should be given another opportunity to develop the evidence further through a new trial on both liability and damages. A new trial on both liability and damages was deemed necessary due to the contested liability issues in the case. Thus, the court remanded for a new trial consistent with their opinion.
