  Background: On February 2, 2007, Geoffrey Dugger went to Joel Martinez's house. Martinez put "cheese" (black-tar heroin and Tylenol PM) in his pocket, and they later purchased tequila and a cigar, filled it with marijuana to make a "blunt," and returned to Dugger’s residence. They consumed tequila, snorted cheese, and smoked marijuana. Martinez fell asleep, began vomiting, and made choking sounds. Dugger yelled for his parents but did not call 911 immediately. Instead, Dugger contacted Martinez's mother, Mary Ann Arredondo, telling her that Martinez had been drinking and was vomiting; she suggested letting him sleep it off. Fifteen minutes later, Dugger's father called 911. Despite emergency services' efforts, Martinez died. The police and paramedics were not informed of the heroin ingestion. Arredondo sued Dugger for wrongful death, claiming negligence due to the delay in calling 911 and not revealing the heroin use. Dugger asserted the common law "unlawful acts doctrine," which traditionally barred a plaintiff's recovery if engaged in an illegal act contributing to their injury, as an affirmative defense. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dugger. The court of appeals reversed, stating that the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 93.001 superseded the common law doctrine. The Supreme Court of Texas reviewed the continued applicability of the unlawful acts doctrine given the state's proportionate responsibility scheme and § 93.001, which provides an affirmative defense for civil actions regarding personal injury or death when the plaintiff was committing a felony leading to final conviction and such felony was the sole cause of damages, or when the plaintiff was committing or attempting suicide.

  Verdict: The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. It held that the common law "unlawful acts doctrine" does not coexist with the proportionate responsibility scheme under Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which suggests that a plaintiff's unlawful conduct, not covered by an expressly stated statutory affirmative defense, should be apportioned rather than bars recovery completely. The court interpreted that the statute § 93.001 reinstates a limited portion of the unlawful acts doctrine to bar recovery solely under specific circumstances articulated within the statute – when there is a final felony conviction or commission/attempt of suicide attributable solely to cause the plaintiff's damages. The adoption of this proportionate responsibility framework has supplanted former doctrines, including the unlawful acts doctrine, as a complete bar to recovery. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was incorrect in applying the unlawful acts doctrine to grant summary judgment for Dugger. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
