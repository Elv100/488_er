Background:
The case centers around a dispute over the payout of a life insurance policy following the death of the insured, M. E. Glass. Glass passed away on April 14, 1900, while undergoing a surgical operation for appendicitis during which chloroform, an anesthetic administered by a regular physician, was used, and he was under its influence at the time of death. The insurance policy, provided by Maryland Casualty Company, contained a provision that excluded coverage for injuries caused by poison or anything taken, administered, absorbed, or inhaled, with an exception for anesthetics administered by a regular physician. The policy stipulated that it would pay out if death resulted from bodily injuries sustained through external, violent, and accidental means, independent of all other causes, within ninety days of the accident that caused the injury. Glass' wife, Mrs. Eula L. Glass, filed a suit to recover the proceeds of the policy.

During the trial, the evidence presented demonstrated that Glass was severely ill with appendicitis, which was at such an advanced stage that without surgery, his death was imminent. The operation was urgently conducted in hopes of saving his life. However, Glass never regained consciousness after being administered chloroform and died on the operating table, before the surgery could be completed.

Key testimony revealed that Glass was in very poor condition prior to the operation, exhibiting signs of septicemia (blood poisoning) due to the burst appendix, which had rendered him in a state of shock and with a very low vitality. Expert witnesses could not conclusively state that the administration of chloroform was the sole independent cause of death, but rather suggested that appendicitis and the anesthetic were concurring factors contributing to his demise.

Verdict:
Based on the policy's terms and the evidence presented, the verdict in favor of the wife claiming the insurance payout would likely be reversed. The burden of proof was on Mrs. Glass to show that the cause of death was due to the chloroform independently of all other causes. The detailed testimonies from medical experts indicated that while chloroform may have been a contributing factor, it was not the sole cause of death. The insured was already in a critical condition due to appendicitis and septicemia, conditions that were likely to lead to his death irrespective of the chloroform administration.

Given the evidence, it can be predicted that the appeal court would find that there was no evidence that decisively supported the conclusion that chloroform was the independent cause of Mr. Glass's death. Furthermore, the evidence overwhelmingly suggested that appendicitis, a pre-existing condition, played a significant role in his death. Therefore, the insurance company would not be liable under the terms of the policy since the death did not result from chloroform independently of all other causes. The case would likely be reversed and remanded due to the lack of evidence to support the original verdict in favor of Mrs. Glass.
