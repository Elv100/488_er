Background:
Appellants Earreserryil and Annamma Berly, individually and as representatives of the estate of Anecletas Berly, along with Transportation Insurance Company (as intervenor), challenged a take-nothing summary judgment from the 14th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas, in favor of appellees, D&L Security Services and Investigations, Inc. and Elbert Phillips, a security guard employed by D&L. Anecletas Berly, an employee at a Kroger store, was fatally shot by a shoplifter while at work. D&L Security Services provided security for the store, and on the day of the incident, Phillips was observing from an upstairs observation room and intervened upon seeing the shoplifter stealing batteries. A scuffle ensued when Phillips attempted to handcuff the shoplifter, who then pulled out a gun and shot Phillips in the eye, and subsequently shot and killed Berly as he tried to flee.

Appellants alleged that D&L and Phillips were negligent in providing security, claiming they failed to properly investigate criminal activity in the area, failed to provide adequate security, failed to properly hire and train guards, and used improper procedures in apprehending the shoplifter. Appellees moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Berly's death was not proximately caused by their actions, their actions were legally privileged under Texas law, and they had no duty, as a matter of law, to protect against the criminal acts of a third person. The trial court permitted Transportation Insurance Company to intervene but eventually granted a partial summary judgment and a final judgment against all appellants, stating that appellees owed no duty to protect against the criminal acts of third parties.

Verdict:
The court predicted that the judgment would be reversed and the case remanded. The appellees were not entitled to summary judgment because the criminal acts that led to the appellant's death were foreseeable, and his death was the proximate result of appellees' negligence in their security measures. The security guard's actions in failing to follow proper procedures, as detailed by industry standards and the policy manuals of Kroger and D&L, collectively contributed to the incident leading to Berly's death. Specifically, the guard violated policy by not patrolling visibly, stopping the shoplifter inside rather than outside the store without another employee, using physical force despite policies prohibiting such conduct, searching the shoplifter without involving police, and improperly searching and attempting to handcuff the shoplifter. The guard's actions were not conducted in a controlled or pro-active manner, which, according to expert testimony, could have prevented the crime.

Moreover, the guard’s failure to follow recognized procedures created a dangerous situation that could have been anticipated, given the general character and prior history of violent crimes in the store's vicinity. Those past instances should have made the risk of violent crime foreseeable, and a reasonable person could have anticipated the dangers created by the negligent conduct. Considering the appellants' evidence of prior criminal activity, including incidents at the store involving force and violence, the court was expected to opine that this created a genuine issue of material fact regarding the foreseeability and reasonableness of appellees' actions in terms of duty and proximate cause.

Additionally, the court would likely predict that any claim of privilege under Texas law or policy, allowing the defense of one’s property or the detention of shoplifters, would not grant immunity since it is not reasonable to cause risk or harm to third parties, and the reasonableness must be assessed by a jury.

Thus, the detailed evidence presented by appellants revealed material factual disputes that precluded summary judgment, as a reasonable person could conclude that appellees' security measures were inadequate and foreseeably led to Berly's death. The court would likely require that these disputed facts be resolved at a full trial on the merits.
