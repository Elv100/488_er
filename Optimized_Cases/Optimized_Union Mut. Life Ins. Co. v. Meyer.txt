Background:
The insured, Eli Landman, suffered from pulmonary emphysema and congestive heart failure and had been hospitalized three months before his death. On December 1, 1969, he sustained injuries, including rib fractures and liver lacerations, in an automobile accident. He passed away in the early hours of December 10, 1969. Four physicians provided testimony regarding whether the heart and lung diseases were substantial proximate causes of death or if they were indirect and remote causes. All agreed that the car accident injuries precipitated the final hospitalization and death on the exact date, but there was disagreement over the role of the liver injury in causing death. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy insisted Landman "died of liver lacerations," arguing that it was not a reasonable probability for the lung and heart conditions to have contributed as causes of death.

The insurance policy issued by Union Mutual Life Insurance Company excluded coverage for "any loss to an Insured Person caused by or resulting from...disease of any kind." The coverage was for loss resulting from an injury defined as "bodily injury caused by an accident...resulting directly and independently of all other causes."

The plaintiff sued the defendant insurer to recover accidental death benefits. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendant insurer, concluding no benefits were owed. The appellate court reversed the decision, causing the insurer to appeal. The appellate court's decision was influenced by conflicting jury findings related to the causes of Landman's death. The jury found that the auto accident injuries were the sole and independent causes of his death but also found the lung and heart disease to be proximate causes of his death, which contradicted each other. The irreconcilable findings did not support a clear judgment for either side.

The trial court gave no other instructions or definitions related to these issues besides the definition of "proximate cause" that states a cause must naturally and continuously produce an event and without it, the event would not have occurred. Multiple proximate causes could exist for an event.

Verdict:
The verdict will affirm the reversal of the trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant insurer because of the irreconcilable findings that the jury presented. Since the jury found the auto accident injuries to be the sole and independent causes of Landmanâ€™s death, their concurrent determination that his pre-existing lung and heart disease were proximate causes created an irreconcilable conflict. This inconsistency means that the jury did not offer an acceptable resolution to the disputed facts of the case.

Despite the plaintiff having the burden of proving that insured's death resulted directly from bodily injuries caused by the accident and not from lung and heart disease, the conflicting jury findings prevent a definite judgment for the defendant. The law requires that the factual issue be resolved before a judgment can be rendered, and since the plaintiff could not conclusively prove the issues surrounding the exclusion in the insurance contract due to the contradictory jury findings, the case must be retried to establish a consistent fact pattern.

Given this assessment, the likely reasoning behind the affirmation of the appellate court's decision is based on procedural grounds, requiring a new trial to acquire a consistent verdict that can support a legal conclusion regarding the insurance claim. The insurer will not be successful in overturning the appellate court's decision because of the unaddressed conflict in the jury's findings, which does not support a clear judgment.
