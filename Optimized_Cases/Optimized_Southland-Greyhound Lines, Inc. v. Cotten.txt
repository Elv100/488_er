Background:
E. E. Cotten, the appellee, initiated a legal action against Southland-Greyhound Lines, Inc., the appellant, seeking damages for the personal injuries his wife suffered and for damages to his automobile, resulting from a collision between one of the company's buses and Cotten’s Ford coupe. The incident took place on the Beaumont-Orange Highway in Texas on the evening of November 9, 1929. Cotten, his wife, and their ten-year-old daughter were driving from Beaumont to Orange when they encountered a parked truck and a parked Chevrolet car on the road as they approached a bridge. Due to oncoming traffic, Cotten had to stop his car behind the Chevrolet, and shortly afterward, the bus driven by an employee of Southland-Greyhound hit the rear of Cotten’s car.

At trial, Cotten presented evidence, including testimony from a bus passenger, that prior to the collision, the bus had been following Cotten’s car closely for several miles. The bus passenger testified that the bus driver had difficulty stopping the bus and even stated, "I am bound to hit them," before the collision. The passenger also examined the bus’s brakes after the accident, finding them to have little to no resistance, indicating they were defective. Additionally, the bus driver himself testified that if he had seen Cotten's car stopping 50 or 75 yards away, he would have had time to stop the bus, confirming he was not blinded by any lights at the distance and had a clear view when Cotten’s car stopped.

Cotten’s wife was severely injured in the accident, became an invalid, and required constant nursing care. She suffered significant weight loss and paralysis in her right leg, along with constant pain and suffering. The bus company challenged both the factual findings of negligence specifically regarding the brakes and the measures of damages awarded for Cotten's wife's care and loss of service, as well as the market value of the car before the accident.

During the trial, multiple issues regarding jury instructions, definitions of proximate cause, considerations of potential contributory negligence, and various other matter were contested. The appellant also argued that the damages awarded were excessive and not properly supported by the evidence.

Verdict:
The Texas court affirmed the judgment in favor of the appellee, Cotten. The court found that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury's finding that the bus's brakes were defective, which is a crucial factor in the chain of events leading to the collision. The court concluded that the defective brakes were a major factor in causing the collision and the appellant company could not prove that any other element, such as the actions of other drivers, the lighting of Cotten’s car, or potential parking violations by the truck and the Chevrolet, was the sole proximate cause of the accident.

Moreover, the jury's instructions regarding proximate cause were deemed proper by the appellate court, and it was judged that the jury was adequately enabled to determine that the defective brakes, along with excessive speed and a failure to maintain a proper lookout, were the proximate causes of the collision, without being unnaturally influenced by improper instructions or definitions provided during the trial.

Concerning the issue of damages, the appellate court found that the testimony and evidence given at trial about the care required for Cotten's wife by the nurses, the past and future medical expenses, and the impact on Cotten's saving capacity, adequately supported the jury’s damages award. Additionally, the jury’s assessment of the damages for the personal injuries to Cotten’s wife was not seen as excessive given the severe and permanent nature of her injuries, her loss of well-being, and the financial impact on the family. The court acknowledged that appellee's wife was in good health before the accident, and her present condition was a direct consequence of the collision. 

The court discounted the contention that there might have been other pre-existing conditions contributing to her health issues after hearing the medical testimonies which established a clear connection between the collision and her current health state, rejecting the possibility that the paralysis could have been due to historical health issues.

The appellate court indicated that the jury was within its rights to make such monetary awards based on the testimony regarding the nurse's regular duties, the ongoing medical expenses, and the general knowledge of a wife's service value to a household. The court recognized that life expectancy figures could be judicially noticed without special pleading or proof. Fundamentally, the court maintained that the decision on responsibility and damages rested solidly within the realms of jury discretion given the evidence presented at trial and did not find any compelling reasons to overturn the verdict based on legal or factual error. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed, and Cotten’s award for damages was upheld.
