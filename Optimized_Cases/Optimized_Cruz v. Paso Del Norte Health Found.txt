Background:
Diana Cruz, individually and as next friend, filed a medical malpractice suit against Paso Del Norte Health Foundation, previously known as Providence Memorial Hospital, for injuries her son Sergio Cruz, Jr., allegedly sustained during labor. The case centered around the alleged negligence of two labor and delivery nurses, who Cruz claimed failed to properly monitor and interpret the baby's fetal heart rate during labor. Cruz arrived at the Providence emergency room in active labor as a "no-doctor patient," meaning she wasn't accompanied by her own doctor and hospital staff was unfamiliar with her medical history. The nurses attached an external fetal heart monitor and administered various standard protocols based on the hospital's guidelines when nonreassuring heart rate patterns appeared.

The baby was delivered by C-section with the umbilical cord wrapped tightly around his neck and shoulders, and he was found to be severely brain-damaged. Cruz's suit originally included the doctor and nurse, but they were non-suited before trial, leaving only the hospital as the defendant. Cruz contented that the nurses failed to recognize nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns and did not notify the attending obstetrician, Dr. Tomasino, in a timely and urgent manner. Cruz argued that this negligence resulted in the lack of prompt intervention—specifically, an emergency C-section—that could have prevented Sergio's brain injury.

During the trial, several expert witnesses testified, with varying opinions regarding the timing and cause of the injury. The plaintiff's experts widely agreed that the injuries were the result of hypoxic ischemic events occurring during labor. The defense experts offered a range of alternative theories, including injury prior to hospital admission, intrauterine growth retardation, seizures after birth, embolism, and infection.

Verdict:
Affirming the judgment in favor of the defendant, Providence, the intermediate appellate court was bound by its judicial limits to uphold the jury's original decision. The court determined that the jury's failure to find the nurses' alleged negligence as a proximate cause of Sergio's injuries was not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence presented at trial. Applying the law of fact-finding and credibility assessments, which are primary functions of a jury, the court pointed out it may not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury.

The reasoning for the verdict would include considerations of the evidentiary record, acknowledging the conflicting expert testimonies on both negligence and causation. The jury's role as the sole arbiter of witness credibility and the weight of their testimony implies that even in the face of seemingly convincing arguments for Cruz's position, the verdict stands if there is competent evidence of a probative force that supports the jury's findings. It respects the jury's discretion in whom to credit among the experts who presented various causation theories, some of which suggested the injuries occurred outside the nurses' care window and some that proposed alternative explanations for the injuries. The appellate court must affirm the trial court's judgment unless the appellant demonstrates that the jury's adverse finding on an issue for which the appellant bore the burden of proof, is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, which was not the case here. Consequently, the appellate court upheld the jury's verdict favoring the hospital, and the take-nothing judgment was maintained.
