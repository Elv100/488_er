Background:
The plaintiff, Daniel R. Songer, an apprentice electrician, sustained injuries while repairing an electrical installation for the defendant, Shell Oil Company, and was subsequently awarded damages by the 164th District Court of Harris County, Texas. Shell Oil was engaged in a joint water flood project in West Texas around Denver City and did not employ electricians themselves but relied on independent contractors for the construction and maintenance of the necessary lines and electrical installations. The plaintiff’s employer, Arther Electric, Inc., was responsible for repairing the system following the damages caused by an electrical storm. 

On the day of the accident, the plaintiff was tasked with making permanent repairs to a transformer bank that had been temporarily fixed by Arther, the president of Arther Electric. Arther de-energized the installation and explained the repair process to Songer, cautioning him to be careful around the transformer bank. After attempting to attach line clamps from the ground using a non-conducting hot-stick, the plaintiff was unable to tighten one and re-ascended the aluminum ladder, where he received an electric shock and fell, leading to injuries that required the amputation of his right leg.

During the subsequent trial, the jury found that Shell's failure to deactivate the high voltage lines was a form of negligence contributing to the accident, assigning 50% of the negligence causing the occurrence to Songer. Shell contended that it owed no duty to Songer to de-activate the power line. The case focused on whether Shell, who operated the high voltage electrical distribution system like a utility, had the responsibility to ensure the safety of the contractor's employees by deactivating the lines where work was being performed, as outlined in the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC).

Expert testimonies were provided, detailing the responsibilities of a utility under the NESC and standard safety practices in the industry. Evidence regarding the definition of a 'utility,' Shell’s role in the water flood project, and management of electricity distribution was examined. The relationship between Shell and the National Electrical Safety Code, as well as their adherence to industry safety standards, was highlighted, alongside the respective duties of the owner of the premises and contractors employed on it.

Verdict:
The court would reverse the damages awarded to the plaintiff and rule that he take nothing from Shell Oil Company due to insufficient evidence to establish a duty on Shell's part to deactivate the electrical lines. It will be determined that no duty is owed by Shell because the inherent dangers of working around live wires were known to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's employer, Arther Electric, had the responsibility to perform work safely. The employer was in a superior position to eliminate any dangers and to furnish the necessary equipment for the safe completion of the work.

The court would assert that it was not Shell's responsibility to anticipate the contractor's work methods, to ensure the contractor provided safety measures for its employees, or to supervise the contractor's compliance with safety precautions. The evidence would not support the imposition of a duty on Shell beyond that of an owner of premises and that there is no evidence that working on an electrical installation posed an unreasonable risk to the employees of an independent contractor like Arther Electric.

Furthermore, the court will likely argue the plaintiff's employer was aware of the location of the work and could have requested deactivation of lines before commencing work. Since the dangerous condition arose from the work activity of the plaintiff and his employer, it would be concluded that Shell had no duty to protect them from hazards inherent in the work they were hired to perform. Therefore, the court will render judgment for Shell Oil Company, concluding the plaintiff Daniel R. Songer should take nothing due to the absence of proof establishing a duty of care owed by Shell in the circumstances of the case.
