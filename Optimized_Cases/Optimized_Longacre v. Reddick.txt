**Background:** The individual plaintiff, Ward Longacre, was severely burned when trying to rescue J. T. Abbott, an employee of J. E. Reddick, from an ignited butane gas spill resulting from a collision of a Reddick-owned butane gas truck and another truck in Wichita County. Longacre sued Reddick and Abbott in Wichita County, asserting that Abbott had been negligent in driving on the wrong side of the road, which led to the collision and ultimately to Longacre's injuries while performing the rescue. Both defendants filed a plea of privilege to move the case to the county of their residence; the trial court overruled Abbott's plea but sustained Reddick's plea, ordering the case against Reddick to be moved to Dallas County. The trial court based its decision on two grounds: first, that any active trespass or crime committed by Abbott had ceased before Longacre attempted the rescue, as Abbott's truck had come to a full stop; second, that there was no negligence as between Reddick and Abbott and thus Longacre could only recover damages from Reddick if Abbott himself could have. The case was under review to determine whether Longacre had a cause of action against Reddick given the circumstances of the incident and the legal principles guiding such situations.

**Verdict:** The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court's reasoning will likely focus on the principle that an employer can be held liable for the negligent acts of their employee when those acts occur within the scope of employment and cause harm to a third party. The court is expected to find that Reddick, as the employer, is responsible for Abbott’s negligence because Abbott's negligence in causing the collision is imputed to Reddick. The court will likely determine that Longacre's rescue attempt was a foreseeable consequence of Abbott's negligence, which implies that Longacre's rescue effort and resulting injuries were natural and probable results of the situation created by the employee's negligence.

The court will probably reject Reddick’s contention that liability only arises if the rescued person has a cause of action against the defendant. Instead, the court is likely to hold that the liability is imposed due to the master-servant relationship and Abbott's actions being within the scope of his employment. This means Reddick can be held accountable for Longacre's injuries regardless of whether Abbott, who was rescued, could himself have maintained a cause of action against Reddick.

The court is also expected to clarify that whether the trespass or negligence has become passive is irrelevant because the immediate cause of the rescue effort—the burning truck—was directly connected to the original negligence act (the collision). The rescued person (Abbott) was in a position of peril due to Reddick’s employee’s (thus Reddick’s imputed) negligence, which proximately caused Longacre's injuries. The trial court's judgment will be overturned, and Longacre's plea to have Reddick’s plea of privilege overruled is likely to be granted, allowing the case to proceed in Wichita County as against Reddick.
