Background:
The appellants, Gary Leroy Weidner and Liberty Cab Company, Inc., appealed a judgment from a personal injury suit in favor of the appellee, Matilde S. Sanchez, after a jury found them jointly and severally liable for her injuries and awarded damages exceeding her initial claim. The cab company had a contract with the Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority (Metro) to transport infirm and handicapped passengers. While driving Sanchez home from her doctor's appointment, cab driver Weidner ran a stop sign and collided with another vehicle. Sanchez walked home and later went to the emergency room, eventually seeking treatment for about six months for injuries that were claimed to be permanent.

Sanchez had initially sought $95,000 in damages in a civil court that had jurisdiction for claims up to $100,000. However, after a deposition revealed her injuries were permanent, Sanchez amended her pleadings to seek $210,000. The appellants raised multiple points of error, including the trial court's jurisdiction, motion for mistrial due to violations of a motion in limine, the denial of various post-verdict motions, the legal sufficiency to support the award, the amendment of pleadings, and the employment status of Weidner, which determined Liberty Cab's liability.

Verdict:
The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, detailing that the jurisdiction was properly established based on the original amount pleaded, which allowed Sanchez to seek prejudgment interest eo nomine. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reinstating the case after an accidental dismissal. Violations of the motion in limine were cured by the jury's instruction to disregard. 

Regarding the verdict's sufficiency, the awarded damages were substantiated by evidence from Sanchez and her doctor, supporting an award for both past and future damages, despite her death. The employment status of Weidner was determined to be that of an employee, not an independent contractor during the transaction at issue, due to compelling evidence showing Liberty Cab's control over his work as required by the contract with Metro. 

The amendment of pleadings post-verdict was permissible, and the trial court's making of findings of fact in a jury trial, while unnecessary, was not seen as reversible error. Lastly, the court found no cumulative error that would cause the rendition of an improper judgment, negating the appellantsâ€™ claim for a reversal based on such grounds.
