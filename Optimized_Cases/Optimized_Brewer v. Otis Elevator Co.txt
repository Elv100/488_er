Background:
The plaintiff, Iris Ramsey Brewer, sustained personal injuries after slipping and falling in an elevator due to a chili spill on its floor. The elevator was located in her apartment building. Brewer initiated a lawsuit against several parties including the Otis Elevator Company (defendant), which held a maintenance contract with the building's owner, Prudential Insurance Company of America. Otis's contractual obligation was to keep the elevators in proper repair.

The trial was taken to a jury, and the court instructed a verdict in favor of American Building Maintenance Company, Inc. After the jury returned their verdict, but before judgment was entered, the plaintiffs settled with Prudential for $3,000, and the plaintiffs filed a settlement agreement reflecting this amount along with an assignment from Prudential of its rights to indemnity or contribution from Otis.

The plaintiff argued that Otis had not only a contractual duty but also had undertaken active management and control of the elevators, imposing a high degree of care for the well-being and safety of passengers. It was alleged that Otis shared joint control over the elevators with Prudential. The case referenced Bond v. Otis Elevator Company, where joint control by both a building owner and Otis was acknowledged in a similar situation.

A core contention was regarding the lighting in the elevator, as Jury Special Issues 10, 11, and 12 addressed whether the lighting was as bright as it should have been under different care standards and whether that was a proximate cause of the fall. Additionally, Special Issue No. 20 considered if the conduct of Dolly Fulsom (who spilled the chili) was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's fall, which the Jury affirmed.

Evidence presented showed that before the elevator could be serviced for cleaning post-spill, Brewer attempted to enter it and consequently slipped and fell. The plaintiff's motion for judgment requested the court to rule in favor of the plaintiff against Otis for damages and for Prudential to receive indemnity from Otis.

Otis's contractual obligations outlined in the contract were considered, including exclusions regarding maintenance responsibilities, especially related to safety tests, new attachments, and negligence or misuse beyond their control.

Verdict:
The court is expected to affirm the decision entering judgment for the defendant, Otis Elevator Company, in the plaintiff tenant's personal injury action. The reasoning would be that Otis's duty was limited to maintaining the elevators in good mechanical condition rather than cleaning spills or safety checks regarding the lighting in the elevators.

The verdict would state that the contract between Prudential and Otis did not place the responsibility for the design of the elevator's lighting system on Otis, nor did the contract require Otis to ensure the cleanliness of the elevator interiors. Given that the spill did not represent a mechanical condition, Otis is not liable for the slip and fall that occurred due to the chili spill.

Furthermore, the court would likely clarify the distinctions between different standards of care. Even though the plaintiff argued for a high degree of care similar to that required for common carriers, Otis's duty would be considered to exercise only ordinary care in maintenance, not to ensure the well-being and safety of elevator passengers at the higher standard.

Since the plaintiff did not appeal the judgment regarding Prudential and American, and no new motion for the trial was filed, the court would rely on the jury's findings and the established scope of Otis's contractual duties. Therefore, the trial court would have correctly declined to award damages, indemnity, or contribution against Otis. The affirmation of the trial court's judgment would be based on the legal interpretation of the maintenance contract and the absence of findings to implicate Otis in a breach of duty that could have prevented the accident.
