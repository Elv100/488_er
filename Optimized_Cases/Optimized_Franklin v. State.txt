Background:
The defendant was convicted of manslaughter after a trial in the District Court of Bexar County, Texas. The incident occurred at a bar where the defendant was working. When the victim requested a deck of cards and the defendant stated he had none, an argument ensued, leading to the victim striking the defendant. The defendant responded by shooting the victim in the leg. Nine days later, the victim died from complications arising from the wound. A key piece of evidence presented by the defense was the testimony of a doctor who examined the victim. The doctor had recommended amputation of the victim's leg to prevent blood poisoning. According to the doctor, the victim and his mother refused the operation. The doctor believed that if the amputation had been performed initially, the victim would not have died. In court, the defense argued that the victim's refusal to undergo amputation constituted gross negligence or improper treatment that should exonerate the defendant. The jury received instructions regarding self-defense, aggravated assault, and manslaughter. 

Verdict:
The court will uphold the defendant's conviction. The court will reason that the victim's refusal to have his leg amputated does not constitute gross negligence or manifestly improper treatment as to exonerate the defendant. It will also be determined that the evidence showed no manifest improper treatment or gross neglect of the wound after it was inflicted. The court will conclude that the defendant's act of shooting the victim was the proximate cause of death, and the victim's refusal to undergo amputation does not diminish the defendant's culpability. The court will cite precedents and legal doctrine establishing that if a wound, irrespective of whether it is naturally mortal, contributes to the death of the victim, the party inflicting it is responsible for homicide. It will be articulated that it is not the law that the victim, in facing a strategic medical decision, is obligated to undergo a serious operation like amputation to mitigate the defendant's criminal liability. The court will clarify that the rule regarding "gross negligence" or "manifestly improper treatment" by someone other than the one inflicting the initial injury (e.g., a physician or nurse) does not apply to the victim's own decisions about their medical treatment. 

Ultimately, the court will find that there was no evidence of gross neglect or improper treatment by any attendants such as physicians or nurses that could have been a direct cause of death other than the wound itself. As a result, the defendant cannot claim that his act was not the proximate cause of the victim's death, and the conviction will stand because the evidence supports the verdict of manslaughter as rendered by the jury.
