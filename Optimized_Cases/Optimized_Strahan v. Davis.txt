Background:
Louis Davis and Helen Davis, a husband and wife, were involved in an automobile collision with a pickup pulling a homemade trailer driven by Larry Strahan, Jr., an employee of Diversified Oil Field Service International, Inc. (Diversified). The pickup slowed to turn left; Mr. Davis stopped his vehicle, but was subsequently rear-ended by Melody Graham, who claimed another vehicle had hit her causing her to strike the Davises. The identity of the third driver was unknown. The Davises sued Diversified, Strahan, and Graham for injuries and damages, and also their insurer, Texas Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau), claiming underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage. Graham also filed a cross-action against Strahan and Diversified, blaming the collision solely on Strahan.

The jury found Strahan's negligence proximately caused the incident and that he was grossly negligent. Mrs. Davis was awarded $240,003.47, including $87,000 for future medical expenses. Mr. Davis was awarded $10,000, with $5,000 for past and $5,000 for future pain and mental anguish. Further, the jury assessed $500,000 in exemplary damages against Strahan. Graham's and the unknown driver's negligence were not found to be the proximate cause. The court awarded judgment against Strahan and Diversified for all damages, including exemplary damages and pre-judgment interest, and ruled the Davises recover nothing from Graham and Farm Bureau.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the judgment against appellants, Strahan and Diversified, in most aspects except the award of future pain and suffering to Mr. Davis due to insufficient evidence supporting that claim. The court will find the evidence legally sufficient to support the jury's awards regarding the proximate cause of the collision, Mrs. Davis's future medical expenses, her lost earning capacity, and the finding of gross negligence. The court will acknowledge Strahan pulling a trailer without proper lighting created an extreme risk, satisfying the objective component of gross negligence, and his awareness of the danger met the subjective component. However, the court will find no evidence of future physical pain and mental anguish for Mr. Davis and will reform the judgment to exclude the awarded $5,000 for future pain and mental anguish due to this lack of evidence.

As for the other objections raised, such as improper jury argument and whether exemplary damages against Diversified are proper without specific findings, these will be overruled. The appellate court will note that any mention of insurance during the trial was not specific enough to constitute reversible error, and any error in the jury argument was curable and was, in fact, addressed by the court during the trial.

Regarding the argument that the exemplary damages award violates due process, the court will also overrule this objection, citing a recent case, City of La Porte v. Prince, as precedent to affirm the award. The verdict will hold Strahan and Diversified jointly and severally liable for the adjusted awards and affirm the judgment as reformed.
