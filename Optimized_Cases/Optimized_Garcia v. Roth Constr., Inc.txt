Background:
Jerry Garcia worked for JBS Construction in 2013 and was contracted to work in Africa on a project for GRC as an employee of JBS, subcontracted to GRC. On February 13, 2013, Jerry was directed to the Victoria Health Department for various vaccinations and received a prescription for Malarone, an anti-malarial medication. He was instructed to take 101 tablets, beginning on March 17 and continuing until completed. After traveling to Equatorial Guinea on March 19, Jerry learned his stay would be longer than 90 days. He completed his Malarone course on June 25, 2013, and upon notifying GRC’s project supervisor Randy Rucker that he would run out before his return, Rucker provided him with an alternative medication, instructions for which were in French. Jerry could not read the instructions but was told the new drug would function like Malarone. This new drug, taken in a different dosage, was later identified as Coartem, which does not prevent malaria but is used to treat it.

After returning to the U.S on July 15, 2013, Jerry developed severe symptoms, including vision problems, which led him to seek medical treatment. His symptoms, except for vision issues, improved upon resuming Malarone on July 17, prescribed by Dr. Bain Cate. However, his vision did not recover, resulting in a diagnosis of "optic neuritis OS." After several consultations and tests, Jerry was diagnosed with optic neuropathy and continued to be treated by Dr. Homerstad and Dr. Woon, a neuro-ophthalmologist. Dr. Woon referred Jerry to Dr. Todd Price, an infectious disease specialist, to determine whether his optic neuritis was due to an active tropical disease or malaria.

In February 2014, Jerry filed a lawsuit against GRC for negligence and gross negligence, claiming personal injuries. Susanna Garcia, his wife, claimed loss of society and services and mental anguish. During pre-trial hearings regarding expert witness testimonies, several motions were made, and GRC filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on the basis that the Garcias had no legally competent evidence of medical causation. The trial court granted GRC's motion after sustaining objections to the Garcias's summary judgment evidence, including the exclusion of testimony and affidavits from their expert witnesses, Drs. Woon and Waxman, on grounds that it failed to adhere to procedural and evidentiary standards, including business records predicate, the reliability and admissibility of expert opinions, and concentration on Rule 702 regarding qualifications to testify on certain matters.

Verdict:
Given the detailed facts from the Background, including the medical treatment records, travel and medication history, Jerry's symptoms, vaccination records, and expert consultation reports and affidavits from qualified professionals, a reasonable person would predict the Trial Court erred by granting GRC's no-evidence motion for summary judgment and improperly excluded evidence. This prediction rests on the idea that Drs. Woon and Waxman, as expert witnesses, are sufficiently qualified to offer reliable opinions on the medical causation of Jerry's optic neuritis. Their expertise in neuro-ophthalmology and infectious tropical diseases, respectively, provides a reliable foundation for their opinions considering they have explained how they have ruled out other probable causes based on Jerry's medical records, laboratory results, clinical presentations, and specialized knowledge within their expertise. In addition, given the use of differential diagnosis—a well-recognized method within the medical community for determining the cause of a patient's ailment—Dr. Woon's process was sound and based on a reasonable medical probability based on the available evidence, making her determination that malaria caused Jerry's optic neuritis admissible.

The exclusion of business records under Tex. R. Evid. 803(6), which considers medical records including diagnoses as admissible without more than a business records affidavit, will be deemed improper. Therefore, Dr. Woon's medical records should not have been excluded since they were accompanied by a proper affidavit. Furthermore, Jerry's affidavit also should not have been entirely excluded as certain background facts and statements of a party opponent are not considered hearsay according to Rule 801(e)(2)(C), (D), and form a permissible basis for his subsequent actions.

Considering the above, the judgment in favor of GRC regarding the lack of evidence of medical causation is likely to be reversed. The appellate court will likely find harmful error in the exclusion of key summary judgment evidence such as the testifying experts’ affidavits, medical records, and consultations, which are pivotal in establishing causation. The case should be remanded for further proceedings to properly consider the causation element with respect to the admitted expert testimonies and evidence. The appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision regarding Roth Construction, Inc., but reverse and remand in part concerning GRC, with instructions that correspond with these predictions.
