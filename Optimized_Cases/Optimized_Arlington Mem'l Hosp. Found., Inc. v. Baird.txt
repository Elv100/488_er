Background:
Appellant Arlington Memorial Hospital ("Arlington Memorial") appealed a jury verdict in favor of appellee Johnny W. Baird ("Baird") in his medical malpractice suit against the hospital. The case arose from an incident on August 12, 1993, when Baird underwent cataract removal surgery performed by Dr. Nirmal Saran at Arlington Memorial and sustained a corneal burn to his right eye. Baird claimed that the injury occurred because the surgeon used a previously used phacoemulsification tip, a device applied to the eye during the surgery to break the cataract into small particles for removal. The hospital regularly reused phaco tips until Baird's surgery, but it was disputed whether the tip used in Baird's surgery was actually used previously.

At trial, Baird sought to establish negligence on the part of the hospital through a nursing expert, Mary Scardino, R.N., who attempted to testify both about the standard of care and the medical causation of Baird's injury. The trial court permitted testimony regarding the standard of care but prohibited Scardino from testifying about the causation of Baird's burn, deeming her unqualified for such medical diagnostics. The hospital contested this exclusion and also argued that the trial court wrongly submitted the negligence issue to the jury due to a lack of evidence proving proximate causation.

Dr. Saran, Baird’s medical expert, testified that a thermal burn likely resulted in Baird's cystoid macular edema and stated that while various issues during surgery could cause a burn, he did not commit any errors, and the equipment was functioning properly upon testing. He thus reasoned the cause "leaves the tip" as a potential reason for the injury. However, he admitted that he could not ascertain with certainty whether the reused tip caused the burn, defining the possibility as a causation but falling short of a reasonable medical probability.

The trial court submitted the negligence issue to the jury, which found in favor of Baird, awarding damages for both negligence and gross negligence.

Verdict:
In the appeal, the court will focus on two main issues raised by Arlington Memorial. First, it will uphold the trial court's decision to limit the testimony of Mary Scardino, as she was not demonstrated to be qualified to medically diagnose thermal burns or be an expert on phacoemulsification equipment, which is essential for establishing causation in medical malpractice. This is consistent with prior case law distinguishing the qualifications necessary for nurses to testify regarding causation.

Secondly, the court will reverse the trial court's judgment for submitting the negligence issue to the jury, concluding that Baird failed to present more than speculative evidence as to the proximate cause of his injuries. Specifically, the court will find that Baird did not establish that there was a reasonable medical probability that Arlington Memorial's alleged negligence, reusing the tip, was a substantial factor in bringing about his injury. Baird’s reliance on mere possibilities, rather than preponderance of the evidence that would unequivocally link the hospital's actions to his injury, falls short of meeting the standard required to establish cause-in-fact under Texas law.

As a result, the court will reverse and render a judgment in favor of Arlington Memorial, effectively dismissing Baird's claim for failing to sufficiently prove that the hospital's alleged negligence was the proximate cause of his injury. The court will determine that the proper judgment should have been for the appellant because Baird did not provide substantiated evidence meeting the required threshold of reasonable medical probability. Therefore, the foreseeability element of proximate cause will also remain moot due to the absence of evidence supporting cause-in-fact.
