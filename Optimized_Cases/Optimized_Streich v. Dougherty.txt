Background:
The appellant, Donald Streich, was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease, leading to the insertion of a Schon catheter by Dr. Ruben Lopez on November 3, 1999, at Valley Baptist Medical Center for dialysis purposes. Dr. Joseph Dougherty, a nephrologist, took over his care, and Streich was discharged on November 5, 1999. Streich was readmitted on November 6, 1999, with fever and chills, and a lab report indicated a staphylococcus aureus infection at the catheter site on November 8, 1999. The catheter was replaced with a left Quinton catheter on November 12, 1999, and Streich complained of back pain to Dr. Dougherty on November 14, 1999. Upon discharge on November 16, 1999, Dr. Dougherty instructed Streich to continue outpatient dialysis.

Streich's back pain persisted, and CT scans revealed an atypical compression fracture. Dr. Dougherty informed him of a hairline crack on January 8, 2000, which he said would improve gradually. When Streich's condition worsened, Dr. Dougherty referred him to a pain center on February 5, 2000, and a neurologist on February 28, 2000, for further evaluation. An MRI on February 29, 2000, revealed an epidural mass, and on March 1, 2000, Dr. Dougherty referred Streich to neurosurgeon Dr. Brent Clyde, who identified a lytic lesion at the L4 vertebrae. Dr. Eric Six operated on March 2, 2000, discovering an infection that was later linked to the earlier catheter surgery.

On February 27, 2002, Streich sent a notice of healthcare liability claim to Dr. Dougherty and others related to care starting November 3, 1999, and filed suit on April 9, 2002. Dr. Dougherty moved for summary judgment on traditional and no evidence grounds, claiming the statute of limitations barred all claims or those occurring before February 27, 2000, and asserting no evidence of duty, breach of duty, or proximate causation. The trial court granted summary judgment without specifying the basis.

Verdict:
The court will focus primarily on whether a physician-patient relationship existed between the appellant and the appellee, and if the appellee owed the appellant a professional duty. The relationship was established, indicating a duty to provide skilled professional care. Expert testimony from Dr. Allen I. Arieff will confirm this and argue that Dr. Dougherty breached the standard of care by not providing sufficient post-surgical treatment, which could have remedied the infection resulting from the catheter surgery.

The court will delve into the intricacies of the statute of limitations, determining that the notice letter Streich sent to Dr. Dougherty does not set the accrual date for limitation purposes but tolls the limitation period once the cause of action has accrued. The notice letter extended the limitation period for 75 days. The court will examine whether Dr. Dougherty's alleged negligence was part of an ongoing course of treatment leading up to February 27, 2000, and beyond.

By evaluating the entire course of treatment from November 1999 through March 2000, the court will likely find that no specific treatment failures can be pinpointed to a particular date but instead, the failures occurred over the entire span of treatment. The court will argue that Dr. Dougherty repeatedly failed to recognize and treat the developing infection and that his negligence continued until the final diagnosis on March 2, 2000.

Consequently, the court will predict that the limitations had not expired when Streich sent his notice letter on February 27, 2002, since the negligent treatment was an ongoing process extending into March 2000, well within the two-year limitation period (plus the 75-day tolling period) when the suit was filed in April 2002.

Therefore, the court will conclude that Dr. Dougherty did not meet his burden to conclusively prove the statute of limitations barred the suit and that summary judgment was inappropriate on both traditional and no evidence grounds. The court will reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings, allowing the appellant's claims to be considered on their merits.
