Background:
The legal case involves Patti J. Wagner, guardian of Jenny Wagner, an incapacitated adult, filing a lawsuit against Four J's Community Living Center, Inc. ("Four J's") and Anthonia Uduma for injuries sustained by Jenny in a fire at a residential care facility for disabled adults operated by Four J's and Uduma. Jenny, who is legally blind, has cerebral palsy, and profound mental retardation, was severely burned in the incident.

On September 4, 2008, Jenny and two other residents were at the facility; Esperanza Arzola, who also had the mental capacity of a small child, and Tanya James, who later died from injuries sustained in the fire. Jenny, who was wheelchair-bound, could not escape the fire and suffered dire burns. It was alleged that Arzola, who had a history of mental health issues and violent behavior, started the fire using a lighter that the staff had inadequately supervised her access to.

Wagner claimed that Four J's and Uduma breached their duty of care by inadequately supervising Arzola and failing to equip the facility with functional fire prevention systems, as well as not properly training staff for fire emergencies. Wagner contended that it was foreseeable that Arzola could start a fire if she accessed a lighter. Furthermore, the staff member on duty, Udemezue, did not attempt to rescue Jenny when the fire started because there was only one available exit which was near the fire, and she did not have keys to the other doors which were locked.

During the trial, it was revealed that Four J's and Uduma were aware of Arzola's aggressive behavior, mental health diagnosis, suicidal tendencies, and history of violence towards staff. An expert witness testified that the standard of care for residential care providers was breached by allowing Arzola access to a lighter, and by failing to provide adequate supervision, room inspections, staffing, and emergency training.

The jury found Four J's and Uduma negligent and responsible for Jenny's injuries, attributing 60% responsibility to Four J's and 40% to Uduma, and awarded Wagner damages of approximately $8 million. However, the defendants filed a motion for a new trial, disputing the findings and arguing that Arzola's intentional action of starting the fire, which was the cause-in-fact of the injuries, made the finding of their negligence incorrect.

The trial judge agreed and granted the new trial motion. Wagner then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting that an appellate court direct the trial judge to vacate the new-trial order. In response, the appellate court considered whether the trial judge abused their discretion in this grant.

Verdict:
The appellate court will conditionally grant the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by Wagner. It will find that the trial judge abused their discretion in granting a new trial and that Wagner has no adequate appellate remedy. The jury's decision to not find Arzola negligent despite her starting the fire reflects reasonable conclusions about proximate cause, which includes both cause-in-fact and foreseeability. 

The evidence showed that Four J's and Uduma's negligence included their breach of standards of care: providing an incendiary device to Arzola, failing to conduct room inspections, lacking adequate supervision and staffing, not conducting appropriate emergency training, and not supplying keys to all exits, which prevented Jenny's evacuation.

Additionally, the evidence did not necessarily indicate Arzola's actions were negligent per se; the jury could have judged her actions as intentional rather than negligent, and thus determined that Arzola was not the proximate cause of the injuries. It is within the jury's purview to make such determinations of fact, particularly regarding proximate cause, which includes considering foreseeability and other factors that constitute negligence.

Therefore, the appellate court will determine that the jury's verdict was not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and was not manifestly unjust as it was supported by ample evidence. It will conclude that a new trial would unjustly disregard the original jury verdict and lead to further expense and delay. The court will direct the trial judge to vacate the order for the new trial, and a writ from the appellate court will issue only if the trial judge does not comply.
