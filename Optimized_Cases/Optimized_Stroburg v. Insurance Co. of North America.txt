Background:
The petitioner, Jay B. Stroburg, son of John B. Stroburg, Jr., sought to recover on an insurance policy issued by the respondent insurer as the beneficiary after his father was killed in an automobile accident. The policy was intended to insure against bodily injury and death caused by accident. The trial court had found in favor of the petitioner, but the civil court of appeals reversed this decision, concluding that the evidence did not support the jury's finding that the insured's death resulted solely from bodily injuries caused by the automobile accident.

The insurance policy in question excluded loss caused by illness, disease, bodily infirmity, or any bacterial infection that did not occur due to an accidental cut or wound. The respondent insurer held that a bleeding ulcer and emphysema, pre-existing conditions suffered by the insured, contributed to his death and therefore sought to deny the claim based on the policy's exclusion clause. The petitioner had the burden of proving that the death resulted directly and independently from the injuries caused by the accident and was not due to the ulcer or emphysema.

The petitioner secured jury answers affirming that the insured's death was a result of the injuries from the accident and that neither the ulcer nor the emphysema contributed to his death. However, the civil court of appeals rejected these findings, indicating that they were not supported by the evidence, which suggested that the pre-existing conditions contributed to the insured's death alongside the accidental injuries.

At the trial level, there were discussions on the medical evidence regarding the cause of death from various doctors. Dr. Moskovitz's testimony suggested that the injuries from the accident were the overwhelming cause of death, while Dr. DaSilva supported the contribution of emphysema. The jury was instructed to consider whether any pre-existing condition was so insubstantial that it did not legally contribute to the insured's death. Though the death certificate mentioned emphysema and the ulcer as contributing conditions, this was considered prima facie evidence subject to rebuttal.

The supreme court found the evidence did not conclusively establish that disease was a proximate cause of the insured's death. Since the policy's exclusionary clause did not explicitly exclude losses indirectly caused by illness or disease and the proximate cause was the accident itself, the court held that the trial court's judgment was supported by the evidence.

Verdict:
The court is expected to reverse the judgment of the civil court of appeals and remand the case back to them for further consideration, instructing them to decide on points of error that assert the evidence was factually insufficient to support the jury's findings. This instruction is given because those points are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the civil court of appeals and were not previously decided. In making its decision, the court will likely emphasize that the policy exclusion for illness and disease only applies if these conditions were the proximate, rather than an indirect or remote cause of death.

The distinction between proximate causes and contributing conditions will be significant in this decision. The appellate court will likely be directed to consider the legal test of substantiality rather than a strictly medical interpretation. This will involve assessing whether the pre-existing conditions were dominant causes or merely incidental factors in the insured's death. If found that the injuries from the accident remained the direct and predominant cause of death, coverage under the policy would be affirmed, as the policy did not expressly exclude indirect contributions from illness or disease to the insured's loss. Therefore, the judgment will likely conclude that the petitioner son is entitled to recover on the insurance policy.
