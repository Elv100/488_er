Background:
This case involves an appeal from a Texas trial court's judgment in favor of a plaintiff family who filed a negligence suit after the death of the father and husband, Henry Joe Naylor, Jr., in a traffic collision. The defendants in this case are the truck driver, Mazzucco, and his employer, Galveston-Houston Breweries, Inc. The collision occurred on the night of November 7, 1949, at an intersection between U.S. Highway 59 (eastern bound), U.S. Highway 90-A (western bound), and Highway 6, about a mile west of Sugarland on the Houston-San Antonio highway. Mazzucco was driving the truck on Highway 6 and stopped at the intersection before colliding with Naylor's vehicle, which was traveling on Highway 59 toward Houston.

The truck, being large and heavily loaded, required Mazzucco to exercise significant care while driving. It is undisputed upon appeal that there was sufficient evidence of Mazzucco's negligence, through failure to keep proper lookout, failure to have the truck under proper control, and his decision to drive across Highway 59 when it was unsafe to do so due to Naylor's close approach, all of which the jury found to be proximate causes of the collision.

In their defense, the defendants claimed that Naylor was intoxicated, which they asserted as an affirmative defense of contributory negligence. The trial court considered intoxication to be merely an evidentiary issue rather than an ultimate issue and did not submit it to the jury as such. The trial court, thus, allowed defendants to present evidence related to Naylor's intoxication, including the presence of liquor and coke bottles in Naylor's car, the odor of alcohol, a blood test, and the manner of his driving. However, the court did not grant instructions to the jury on recklessness or the implications of impaired condition on the family's entitlement to damages, despite evidence that could have led to a determination of Naylor's recklessness due to intoxication.

In the original judgment, the deceased's widow was awarded $30,000, and each of his three minor children was awarded $10,000. The cost of funeral expenses was stipulated.

Verdict:
The appellate court will reverse the trial court's decision and remand the case for a new trial on the basis that the jury should have been instructed on reckless driving due to the evidence presented that Naylor could have been driving recklessly as a result of alcohol influence. The appellate court will find that, while the issue of intoxication alone is not an ultimate issue of negligence in a civil case, it is indeed a factor to weigh in considering a charge of contributory negligence. Therefore, defendants are entitled to argue that, if the jury finds that Naylor was driving recklessly as a result of intoxication, this impaired condition could negate the family's entitlement to compensation.

Additionally, the court will hold that the argument made by the plaintiff's counsel in closing, which could imply to the jury the consequences of their decision regarding Naylor's alleged intoxication, constituted prejudicial error since informing the jury of the effect of their answer is not permissible. The appellate court will acknowledge that while evidence of intoxication does not solely establish negligence or proximate cause, it is a significant evidentiary fact to be considered in conjunction with other evidence when determining acts of contributory negligence. Based on this, the court will conclude that the trial court's overruling of the objection to the argument and refusal to instruct the jury not to consider the effects of the intoxicated driving was reversible error, necessitating a new trial.
