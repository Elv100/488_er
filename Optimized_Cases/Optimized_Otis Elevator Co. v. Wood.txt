Background:
The respondent claimant, Lou Mae Wood, and her husband initiated a personal injury lawsuit due to injuries the respondent sustained in an escalator accident at the R. E. Cox department store in Waco, Texas. The elevator company, the store itself, and the general contractor for the store's building were named as defendants. The primary focus of the case was the determination of responsibility for the open space design beside the escalator’s handrail and whether a protective extension should have been installed.

During the incident, the respondent was caught and held in an unguarded space between the escalator’s side wall and the handrail. The design and negligence of the elevator company in not extending the top of the stationary guide of the handrail, and the handrail's friction pulling power when contacted by a person, were all in question.

Trial proceeded with a jury finding that the petitioner (Otis Elevator Company) was responsible for the design of the open space, that said design was negligence, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the respondent's injuries, including minor physical harm and a heart attack. The jury absolved the other defendants, Cox and Smith Building Company, from negligence. Both the trial court and the appellate court affirmed the judgment against Otis.

Key evidentiary points included expert testimony that the escalator could have been designed with a protective extension to prevent contact with the moving handrail, that the handrail could exert pulling force when contacted, and that other escalators had such protections in place. A hospital report was entered into evidence, documenting a medical opinion on the respondent's heart condition.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the appellate court's order and uphold the judgment of the trial court, finding evidence to support the jury's determination that the petitioner's negligent acts were proximate causes of the respondent’s accident. The court will hold Otis Elevator Company to a standard of reasonable care in the escalator's design, suggesting that the duty to protect against foreseeable risks is aligned with the product's intended use, which, in this case, includes the escalator's movement and vicinity.

The justification for the verdict will likely rest on the principle that even if the exact manner of the injury could not have been foreseen, a manufacturer should reasonably anticipate the general nature of potential injuries associated with the product's use. Therefore, it will be concluded that Otis had a duty to exercise reasonable care in designing the escalator to prevent such accidents, taking into account its intended use and surrounding environment.

On issues of medical evidence and causation regarding the respondent's heart attack, the court will likely determine them to be questions for the jury and will weigh the need for expert medical testimony to fall within the realm of reasonable medical certainty. However, they will also consider the substance rather than the semantics of such testimony. If the testimony implies a reasonable medical probability, even if not explicitly stated, it may be deemed admissible.

Finally, the court will address Otis's claim of indemnity from Cox, likely determining there is insufficient legal basis to conclude that Cox contractually failed to provide proper framed openings for the escalator, as there was a jury finding that the responsibility was Otis's. Therefore, the court will affirm that Otis is not entitled to indemnity from Cox, and the judgments against Otis will stand.
