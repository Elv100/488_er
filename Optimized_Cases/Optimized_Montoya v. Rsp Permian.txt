Background:
In May 2018, Jaime Montoya, Sr., an employee of Pepe Le'Pew Oilfield Rental, was working at RSP Permian's Johnson Ranch wellsite No. 1022MS in Martin County. He was there to operate a pump and tank for his employer. Consultant Don Frank Thomas saw the decedent working upon arrival at the well, but left the site for about fifteen to twenty minutes. Upon Thomas's return, he found the decedent "slumped over" and initiated CPR after not finding a pulse. The appellants, Maria Montoya, Jaime Montoya, Jr., and Javier Montoya, survivors of Jaime Montoya, Sr., filed suit alleging his death was due to inhaling hydrogen sulfide gas attributable to the appellees' negligence.

The appellants claimed various acts of negligence predicated on the assertion that hydrogen sulfide inhalation caused the decedent's death. They argued evidence spoliation occurred, contending that the hydrogen sulfide monitor provided to them was not the one decedent wore at his death; Thomas moved the body from the original location; and that Thomas and a Pepe Le'Pew representative influenced the justice of the peace not to perform an autopsy. No autopsy was performed at death, and the justice of the peace ruled natural causes. Over thirty days post-embalming, Dr. Thomas Parsons performed a "private autopsy" but did not find evidence of death by hydrogen sulfide and pointed to cardiovascular disease indications.

Evidence showed that Thomas did not smell hydrogen sulfide, his monitor did not go off, nor did decedent’s monitor or others’ respond when decedent was found. The well was shut in, to prevent gas flow. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Pepe Le'Pew for not providing adequate hydrogen sulfide hazard training, referencing the date and location of the decedent's death, but did not conclude hydrogen sulfide caused the death. OSHA cause of death was "undetermined".

Verdict:
Considering the detailed background of the case, the court was likely to affirm the trial court’s decision to grant no-evidence motions for summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the basis that the appellants could not demonstrate with evidence that the decedent’s death was caused by hydrogen sulfide exposure. The evidence presented did not rise above speculative levels to establish a causal link between the death of Jaime Montoya, Sr., and exposure to the gas at the worksite.

The complaints of spoliation of evidence likely lacked merit because reasonable explanations were provided for all actions taken post-incident (such as Thomas performing CPR), and no abuse of discretion appeared on behalf of the trial court regarding these matters. Since the OSHA citation did not directly tie the lack of training to the decedent's death and was not admissible for common law negligence, it did not serve as sufficient evidence for a causal connection.

The court would affirm the summary judgments on grounds that there was no more than a scintilla of evidence to prove hydrogen sulfide was a cause in fact of the decedent’s death. Without evidence of proximate cause and given that the other people present were not affected, signs of the decedent’s arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a lack of alarms from hydrogen sulfide monitors, the appellants could not meet their burden to show that the exposure was a substantial factor in the death. Hence, the appellants' negligence claims lacked a causal basis, supporting the appellees' grants for summary judgment.
