Background:
Appellants John Edward Hennessy and Donald Lee Wine, who were pedestrians, filed a personal injury action against the estate of Rudy Perez following a sequence of events that led to their injuries. On January 6, 1985, at 3:00 a.m., Rudy Perez lost control of his truck on I-10 in Houston. The truck collided with a guardrail, flipped, and ended up blocking the leftmost traffic lane. Perez was projected out of the truck onto the highway, where he sustained severe injuries leading to his death. Police later found both opened and unopened beer cans in the truck's cab. Hennessy and Wine stopped to assist Perez. While Wine set up flares on the road with the help of an off-duty policeman and Hennessy phoned for medical help, Robert Lesley Clay, driving a car owned by Jimmy Charles Clay, drove through the flares and hit the appellants at approximately 3:20 a.m. Clay was arrested at the scene for driving while intoxicated.

Appellants originally filed suit against the Clays and Perez, alleging their negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries. They settled with the Clays and subsequently, the trial court granted a take-nothing summary judgment in favor of Perez's estate, asserting that Perez's actions could not have caused the appellant's injuries as they had already ceased, and the occurrence was unforeseeable, thus acting as a superseding cause.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee driver's estate. Firstly, the fact question pertaining to the appellants' entitlement to the benefit of the rescue doctrine will be found relevant. The appellants engaged in a rescue effort by setting up flares and calling for an ambulance, planning to stay until help arrived. The rescue doctrine recognizes the liability of a negligent party when they provoke a rescue effort, and the rescuer's injury is a consequence that could reasonably have been foreseen by the negligent defendant. Since the appellants were injured while attempting rescue, it would be considered foreseeable under this doctrine that such rescue actions could result in injury, particularly on a heavily trafficked highway.

Even without resorting to the rescue doctrine, it will be contended that a fact issue remains, preventing summary judgment, linked to whether Perez's conduct while allegedly driving intoxicated on a busy interstate could have foreseen the threat to the appellants. The required foreseeability factor in negligence is not dependent on the prediction of the exact incident but rather on whether the type of injury was of such a general character that might reasonably have been anticipated.

Finally, the "Bell v. Campbell" case will not be deemed analogous or controlling in this situation, given that the case at hand involves an unsettled question concerning the foreseeability of the appellants' injuries, and the rescue doctrine was not an issue in the Bell case. The court's decision will focus on the fact that there is still an open factual dispute regarding the foreseeability of the injury, which means the summary judgment was improperly granted. 

The case will be remanded for a trial on the merits based on the complex interplay of issues around foreseeability and the application of the rescue doctrine, indicating that the matter is not suitable for summary judgment and requires a full trial to resolve these factual disputes.
