Background:
Ethel Sawyer, the widow of Arthur P. Sawyer, and her minor son Orville Sawyer, filed a lawsuit against El Paso Electric Company for damages due to the death of Arthur Sawyer. Arthur Sawyer, employed by the electric company, was an experienced electrician and lineman engaged in work on one of the company's power line poles at the time of the fatal incident. He died from electric shocks while working alongside another lineman and co-employee, Joseph W. Watson, to make alterations to the electrical apparatus on the pole.

The work involved connecting a new transformer to a cut-out box previously connected to an old transformer by an insulated copper wire, known as a primary lead. Arthur Sawyer, who was responsible for this task, inserted the new primary lead into the cut-out box without removing the old wire first, leaving the old wire dangling from the slot.

Watson later clipped the old wire close to the slot and inserted the plug into the cut-out box, thus electrifying the wires, including the piece of copper wire left in the slot. Watson notified another worker that the current was on, which Sawyer knew as well. Shortly after, Sawyer, while scraping insulation from another wire, came into contact with the cut-out box and presumably with the exposed end of the clipped copper wire. This contact resulted in an electric shock that threw Sawyer back into a guy wire attached to the pole, which was in contact with a ground wire without a circuit breaker. Sawyer received additional shocks from this contact, resulting in his death.

The trial court found in favor of Ethel Sawyer, based on the jury's findings that the electric company was negligent in four specific ways: inserting the plug into the cut-out box, leaving an exposed live wire in the cut-out box, maintaining the guy wire without a circuit breaker, and allowing the guy wire to contact a live electric wire. Each of these acts was deemed a proximate cause of Arthur Sawyer's death. The jury also found that although Sawyer was negligent in not removing the idle wire, it was not the sole proximate cause of his death.

The electric company appealed the judgment, raising several points of error, objecting to the charge to the jury and arguing that Sawyer's own negligence was either the sole proximate cause of his death or that the negligence found on the part of the company was not a proximate cause. They also contended that assumed risk issues should have been submitted to the jury among other grounds.

Verdict:
Predictively, the court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, holding the electric company liable under Texas statutes, specifically Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 8306. This will be done even considering that Arthur Sawyer may have been guilty of contributory negligence by not removing the idle wire. The rationale for this will be based on Texas law which, at the time, did not allow contributory negligence to serve as a full defense against employer negligence in worker's injuries or deaths. 

The court will reject the appellant's argument that Sawyer's failure to remove the old primary lead was solely and proximately responsible for his injury and death because it was only one of several acts of negligence that caused the incident. The court will likely support the idea that several acts of negligence can each be proximate causes of an injury and that it is usually a fact for the jury to determine which negligent act was a proximate cause of the injury. 

Additionally, the court will dismiss the electric company's argument about the negligence of Sawyer being a sufficient proximate cause by clarifying the difference between "the proximate cause" and "a proximate cause." It will emphasize that for a defense to be valid under the statute, Sawyer's negligence would have had to be the sole proximate cause, which the jury did not find.

Regarding the appellant's contention about assumed risk, the court will uphold that the defense of assumed risk has been abolished by statute in the context of workers' compensation and is, therefore, not applicable. 

Lastly, the court will respond to other points of error raised by the appellant, such as the insertion of the word "sole" in certain jury instructions and the refusal to submit certain special issues to the jury. The court will conclude that the instructions given were legally sound and that the jury was not misdirected by the inclusion of terms like "sole" in the instructions related to proximate cause.

In summary, given the detailed background information, the court's ruling will likely be highly technical, considering the various legal nuances, particularly concerning proximate cause, contributory negligence, and assumed risk under the relevant Texas statutes.
