Background:
The parents of Ricardo Serna Alvarado, namely Victor and Olga Alvarado, initiated a wrongful death and survival action against the City of Brownsville following Ricardo's suicide at the city jail, where he hung himself with a blanket from the cell bars. Ricardo, a nineteen-year old, was arrested for driving while intoxicated and placed in a detoxification cell by himself. There were no signs that indicated Ricardo was upset, emotional, violent, or suicidal; however, his friends testified that he had been disturbed earlier that day after being rejected by a schoolmate. According to the City of Brownsville Jail Procedures Manual, cell checks were required every twenty minutes, with more frequent checks for potentially suicidal or violent prisoners.

On the day of Ricardo's death, the last cell check by Jailer Perez was at 6:50 p.m. Shortly after, two new prisoners arrived, obstructing the jailers' view of Ricardo's cell during their booking. Ricardo was discovered deceased at 7:20 p.m. The jailers justified their failure to perform timely cell checks by claiming that booking procedures had priority over cell checks. At trial, evidence was presented regarding jail procedures, but other evidence concerning the personnel history of one of the jailers, a prior suicide attempt, state jail standards, and identification of suicidal inmates was excluded by the trial court.

The jury was asked if city negligence caused Ricardo's death, if Ricardo's own negligence caused his death, and the percentages of negligence attributable to each. They concluded the city was not negligent but found Ricardo's negligence caused his own death, and did not answer the question regarding percentages since it was contingent on an affirmative answer to both prior questions.

The appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial, finding that the trial court had improperly excluded evidence and had confused the jury by asking about Ricardo's negligence. An application for writ of error was filed by the city, arguing that any trial court error was harmless since the jury had sufficient evidence to arrive at a proper judgment. The appellate court's decision was based on the notion that the exclusion of evidence potentially impacted the trial's outcome.

Verdict:
The verdict will reverse the decision of the appellate court and render judgment in favor of the city. The reasoning will be that despite the appellate court's concerns, the errors made by the trial court were considered harmless. The verdict will determine that the questions regarding Ricardo's negligence did not sway the jury's decision since the jury concluded that the city was not the proximate cause of his death regardless of Ricardo's actions. It will be decided that the questions presented to the jury were neither ambiguous nor misleading, focusing on responsibility rather than the cause of death, which was not contested.

The verdict will also address the exclusion of evidence by the trial court, concluding that excluding such evidence was within the court's discretion and did not likely affect the judgmentâ€™s outcome. The decision to exclude evidence related to policy formulation will be justified on the basis of preserving sovereign immunity for the city, while holding that it waived immunity for negligent implementation claims, and even if such evidence was included, it is not probable that the outcome would have differed. The evidence that was admitted to trial, including the jail manual and testimony regarding jail procedures and jailer actions, will be considered sufficient for the jury to deliberate and decide if the city failed to properly implement its policies. The cumulative review will determine that the evidence presented at trial provided a complete enough picture to argue whether the jailers acted negligently within the established city policy. The court will conclude that the Alvarados failed to prove the exclusion of evidence had probably led to an improper judgment. Therefore, a judgment will be rendered that the Alvarados recover nothing from their claims against the city.
