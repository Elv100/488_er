{Background: The case involves a premises liability action against Amoco Chemicals Corporation, which owned and operated premises where an accident involving a nitrogen-filled reactor occurred. The reactor was located in the "ultracracker unit" at Amoco's Texas City refinery. The incident resulted in the deaths of Robert Milton Sutton and Aquiles Salinas, who were employees of Arsco, Inc., a sandblasting and painting contractor. Charles Marzka, an employee of Catalyst Services, Inc., another contractor, sustained injuries while attempting to rescue Sutton and Salinas. Arsco was under contract with Amoco and had an express indemnity provision in the contract. Amoco sought indemnity from Arsco after a jury verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs—survivors of the deceased and for the insurance companies who intervened due to workers' compensation claims. Both Sutton and Salinas met their deaths in reactor 101-D, one of three identical reactors equipped with temporary elevators installed by Amoco; these reactors were accessed via ladders. Appellant Amoco argued that Sutton and Salinas were not invitees when they entered the reactor, given that Amoco had no duty towards them at that particular place; they further contended knowledge of the danger associated with the reactor by Reyer, the supervisor of Sutton and Salinas, was enough to absolve Amoco of liability, and that Sutton had been warned of the dangers of nitrogen in the reactor. During the purge of the reactor with nitrogen, none of Amoco's safety measures were followed—no barriers, signs, tags, or warning personnel in place. The jurors concluded Sutton and Salinas were indeed invitees at the time of their deaths, and their entry into the reactor was reasonably foreseeable by Amoco, who owed them a duty to keep the premises safe. On the question of indemnity, Amoco argued for indemnification from Arsco under the contract regarding the deaths, which the jury agreed with, but also for Marzka's injuries, which the jury did not find Arsco responsible for.

Verdict: The court affirmed the judgment that Amoco premises owner owed a duty of care to Sutton and Salinas as invitees to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition. The court held that due to Amoco's negligence, which created the dangerous condition that led to the deaths of Sutton and Salinas, Amoco was liable for the resulting damages. Since it was reasonably foreseeable that persons like Sutton and Salinas would enter the reactor, and given that no safety measures were enforced during the dangerous nitrogen purge procedure, Amoco failed in its duty as the occupier of the premises. The court also found that the third party (Arsco) was liable for indemnification to Amoco for the deaths, but not for the personal injuries sustained by Marzka, as the latter's injuries were deemed the result solely of Amoco’s actions, not contributory to Arsco's negligence. As to the indemnity claim, although Amoco's premises owner was entitled to indemnification from Arsco for the deaths due to the indemnity agreement, the court held that Amoco could not be indemnified for Marzka's injuries because those resulted from Amoco's sole negligence, as determined by the jury. Thus, Amoco was not entitled to any indemnity from Arsco regarding Marzka’s injuries, leading the court to reverse this portion of the judgment. In conclusion, Amoco failed to protect invitees on its premises and was held liable for damages associated with the incident. Additionally, the court outlined the limits of the indemnity provision in the contract, highlighting that the protection it provided did not extend to incidents resulting from the indemnified party's sole negligence.
