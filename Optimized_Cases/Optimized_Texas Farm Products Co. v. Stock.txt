Background:
The appellant employer (Farm Products) sought a rehearing for a review of the order of the 145th Judicial District Court of Nacogdoches County, Texas, after a jury verdict awarded damages to the appellee employee (Stock) for personal injuries sustained while working within the scope of his employment with the appellant. The employee had filed a suit for personal injuries after slipping and falling on grease at work. Appellant contended that the damage award was excessive and raised several points of error regarding the conduct of the trial.

Key details include:
- The employee fell and was injured on grease that was present on the shop floor.
- The employer admitted to a non-delegable duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace.
- There was no direct evidence of who caused the grease spill.
- On the day of the incident, no cleanup crew or employee other than the mechanics were responsible for cleaning the work area, and no one worked in the stall where the employee fell during the previous shift.
- Evidence was presented showing that grease on the floor was not uncommon and that there was not a general policy to clean up between shifts.
- The employee had a rare bone disease, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which made his bones prone to fracture from mild trauma and his back was generally deformed with multiple old vertebral fractures.
- He had a compression fracture of his second lumbar vertebra (L-2) due to the fall, which caused ongoing pain and disability with no available treatment.
- Before the injury, the employee had a substantial work history, but after the incident, he was unable to work and was terminated due to an inability to perform his duties.
- The jury awarded damages totaling $219,670.

Verdict:
The court on rehearing will affirm the judgment of the lower court, which entered a jury verdict for the appellee employee. The decision will be based on the sufficient evidence presented that supports the jury's findings of the employer's negligence, either through their actions or the actions of their servants, which ultimately led to the employee's injuries. The court will conclude that the grease on the floor constituted a hazard that, under ordinary care, should have been known and removed before the accident occurred. It will be acknowledged that while the appellant employer had a duty to maintain a safe work environment, the presence of grease was not uncommon in such a workplace. However, the absence of policy for cleaning or inspecting the mechanicâ€™s work area between shifts will be considered a failure to exercise ordinary care in maintaining workplace safety.

Furthermore, the court will hold that prejudicial statements made by the appellee's trial counsel do not warrant a reversal of the judgment because the admission of these statements did not impact the findings of the jury. In evaluating the damages awarded, the court will consider the significant personal and economic impact the injury had on the employee, particularly his ongoing pain, loss of earning capacity, and the debilitating and permanent nature of his injury. However, the court will find the amount awarded by the jury to be excessive in light of the evidence provided.

The court, in its discretion, will reform the judgment to reduce the amount of damages awarded to a level that it considers fair and reasonable, taking into account the existing evidence of the employee's pain, suffering, and economic loss, as well as the permanency of his injuries. The reformed amount will still provide substantial compensation to the employee for the injury he sustained. The appellant's request for a reversal will be denied if the appellee agrees to a remittitur of the damages to the amount determined by the court. If the appellee complies with the remittitur, the verdict will stand as reformed; otherwise, a new trial will be ordered.
