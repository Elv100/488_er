Background:
Seitel Data, Ltd. (the company) entered into a contract to conduct seismic testing on property owned by the Ralph Simmons and Laura Angela Simmons Family Living Trust (the owners) in Shelby County, Texas. The owners ran a chicken growing operation that required significant water usage, provided through two productive water wells and a city water line for backup. Shortly after the company completed seismic testing, one of the water wells failed. The owners sued the company for damages, claiming the well failure was caused by the seismic testing which involved underground explosions. The owners presented testimony from both Ralph and Laura Simmons and a well driller but did not provide an expert on seismic testing. The company chose not to call any witnesses. The trial before a jury resulted in the owners being awarded damages under breach of contract and tort theories, with the owners electing to recover under contract theory.

The contract claimed that the company would be liable for damages resulting from seismic operations. The owners and the well driller testified about the close temporal relationship between the seismic testing and the well's failure, providing evidence of sand and mud production by the well, excessive filter changes, overheating, and the need to drill a new well. There was also evidence of two nearby property owners with wells who experienced similar issues post-testing. Despite the testimony, the company argued on appeal that the lack of evidence from an expert seismologist left insufficient proof that their testing caused the damage.

Verdict:
The appeal court will likely focus on the sufficiency of evidence to prove causation, given the company’s request for reversal based on a "no evidence" standpoint rather than a factual sufficiency review. Seitel's argument that expert testimony is mandatory to prove it breached the contract will not convince the court. The court will find that the necessity for expert testimony regarding the effects of seismic testing, particularly on water wells, depends on the complexity of the given case. In situations where the connection between an event and the damage is straightforward enough to be within a layperson's understanding, expert testimony will not be deemed necessary.

The court will opine that jurors are capable of employing common sense to draw a conclusion about the causal relationship between the seismic testing and rapid well failure. The temporal and physical proximity of testing and well problems, along with the experiences of neighboring property owners, will be deemed sufficient to establish a strong and logical connection justifying the jury's verdict. The court will assert that just as people can understand certain natural phenomena without detailed scientific explanations, they can also reasonably conclude that ground vibrations strong enough to remove a plaque from a wall can likewise disrupt underground geological formations to cause sand infiltration into a well.

However, the jury's award of appellate attorney's fees will be reversed due to insufficient evidence presented on this aspect at trial. Since attorney's fees must be supported by competent evidence and the owners offered no proof of expected appellate attorney fees, this portion of the judgment cannot stand.

In summary, the appellate court will modify the judgment to remove the award of appellate attorney fees but will affirm the judgment as modified, upholding the jury’s findings on causation and damage awards based on the lay testimony and circumstantial evidence provided at trial.
