Background:
Francisca Olivares, the plaintiff pedestrian, filed a personal injury action against the San Antonio Public Service Company, the defendant utility. The plaintiff alleged that while she was walking along a public street on the outskirts of the City of San Antonio, during or shortly following an unprecedented rain and electric storm, three overhead electric light wires owned by the defendant fell to the ground due to the defendant's negligence, causing her to suffer a severe shock and serious bodily injuries. The plaintiff articulated several acts of negligence on the part of the defendant, including assertions that the insulation on the wires was faulty, the wires were too loosely strung, the defendant had failed to inspect the wires within a reasonable time, the wires were strung too low, and the defendant had failed to bury the wires.

The case was brought to trial, and the jury was tasked with determining the truth of these allegations. Each of the alleged acts of negligence was submitted as special issues to the jury, who found against the plaintiff on each count. The jury concluded that the wires fell as a result of lightning, that the plaintiff suffered no physical shock or damage due to the fallen wires, and therefore had not sustained any damages. The plaintiff acknowledged, by not challenging the jury findings, that there was sufficient testimony to support these conclusions.

During the trial, the issue of whether the defendant was negligent for not having buried the wires was raised. An argument made by one of the defendant's counsel suggested that burying the wires would be very costly and would cause the utility to charge higher rates, which could have influenced the jury as some jurors were consumers of electricity provided by the defendant. The plaintiff objected to this argument, but the objection was overruled with the court stating that the argument was unlikely to have influenced the jury's specific findings regarding the lack of shock, damages, and the cause of the wires falling.

Furthermore, the plaintiff requested the trial judge to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which would infer negligence from the mere occurrence of the event, but the trial judge refused, given the jury's findings.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court, denying the plaintiff, Francisca Olivares, any recovery. The verdict will be supported by the jury's specific findings, which effectively reject each of the plaintiff's allegations of negligence. Since the jury determined that the incident's occurrence, namely the falling of wires, was caused solely by lightning—a factor not under the control of the defendant utility—the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur will be declared inapplicable. Additionally, the jury's findings that the plaintiff did not suffer any physical shock or damages from the fallen wires mean that even if there was negligence on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recovery without proven injury or damages.

The reasoning for the court's verdict will also address the objections raised by the plaintiff regarding the allegedly prejudicial comments made by the defendant's counsel. The court will determine that even if the counsel's arguments concerning the cost of burying the wires and the difficulty in procuring witnesses were improper, they were ultimately harmless given that they did not likely influence the jury's decision based on the context of the full jury findings.

Therefore, the court's ruling will center on the jury's determinations which did not find the utility's negligence nor damages to the plaintiff, rendering the plaintiff's objections and requests for reconsideration moot and leading to the affirmation of the judgment by the appellate court.
