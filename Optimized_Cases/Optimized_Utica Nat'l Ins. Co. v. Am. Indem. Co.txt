Background:
Mid-Cities Surgi-Center hired a scrub technician, David Wayne Thomas, who stole fentanyl—an anesthetic—contaminated it with Hepatitis C, and resealed the ampules to conceal his theft. After Thomas’s actions were discovered, he was convicted and imprisoned. Subsequently, patients who received fentanyl injections prior to the discovery of Thomas's crime filed a lawsuit against Mid-Cities Anesthesiology, P.A., which consisted of a professional association of ten doctors who practiced anesthesia at the surgical center, collectively referred to as the doctors' association. The patients alleged negligence in various forms, including failing to properly secure anesthesia narcotics and exposing them to contaminated medication. 

The doctors' association's professional liability insurer initially defended the suit but became insolvent. The Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association (TPCIGA) then assumed its obligations. TPCIGA tendered the suit for defense and coverage to American Indemnity Co., the general liability insurer at the time of the litigation. American Indemnity initially denied coverage based on effective dates but later agreed to assist TPCIGA in settling the claims for approximately one million dollars, without involvement from Utica National Insurance Company, who was the general insurer at the time of the infection. 

American Indemnity filed a suit seeking reimbursement from Utica for settlement costs, arguing that Utica breached its obligation to defend due to a policy excluding coverage for any "bodily injury... due to rendering or failure to render any professional service." Utica contended that the policy precluded coverage any time medical treatment was a but-for cause of injury, even if services were rendered with due care. However, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, determining the exclusion applied only when there was a breach of standard of care in rendering professional services. The plaintiffs' pleadings suggested possible negligence in the drug's administration and in its storage—issues involving both professional, covered by professional liability, and non-professional negligence. The latter, potentially covered by general liability insurance, activated the duty to defend under the eight-corners doctrine. 

Verdict:
The court is expected to affirm the duty to defend as mandated by the eight-corners doctrine, which dictates that an insurer must defend a lawsuit if the facts alleged in the pleadings could potentially fall within the policy's coverage. It is foreseeable that since the plaintiffs' pleadings allege negligence in both administration and storage of the drug—actions that could involve non-professional standards of care—the general liability insurance from Utica should have been enacted to defend the doctors' association. The crux of the duty to defend is based on the possibilities raised within the pleadings themselves, not the ultimate liability or manner in which professional services were rendered.

Moreover, the court will likely clarify that the duty to indemnify is distinct from the duty to defend and is resolved separately. While Utica was held responsible for defense costs, the company's obligation to indemnify for the settlement will not be established as a matter of law, as the record on appeal won't definitively determine whether the patients' injuries resulted from a violation of professional standards of care—a breach that would trigger the professional service exclusion in Utica's policy. 

Given that the indemnity obligation centers on factual determinations rather than legal interpretations, the court will probably reverse the court of appeals' judgment on the indemnity issue. It is expected that the case will be remanded to the trial court for a factual resolution on whether the breach of professional standards of care by the doctors' association contributed to the injuries to the patients, thereby enabling the application of the professional services exclusion and negating Utica's duty to indemnify. If, on remand, it is found that the injuries were co-caused by factors both covered and excluded under the policy, the general liability insurer would not be required to indemnify for those injuries. In essence, the verdict will underscore the insurers' respective responsibilities and the need for further examination of causation to satisfactorily resolve the indemnity aspect of the dispute.
