Background:
In May 2016, Comfort Agara took her 2009 Mercedes to Mercedes-Benz of Clear Lake ("MBCL") for a check because her check engine light was on. MBCL performed a "limited courtesy vehicle inspection," during which they checked and passed the power steering fluid level, power steering condition, and power locking system operation. The mechanic found other problems, like worn brakes, fog lights, and centrifuge cover issues, and recommended replacing bald rear tires. Agara authorized repairs only to her brakes and centrifuge cover. After collecting her vehicle and driving onto the Interstate Highway 45 in light rain, Agara lost the ability to steer, resulting in an accident causing her severe injuries. Subsequent investigation found low power steering fluid and hard steering, with a cited cause of fluid loss potentially due to collision impact. An officer post-accident cited her for unsafe driving speed for conditions.

Agara sued MBCL for negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, and gross negligence. She claimed MBCL failed to service and inspect the power steering system properly, contributing to her loss of control. MBCL denied all allegations, arguing responsible factors included Agara's worn tires, excessive speed, and weather conditions.

MBCL moved for a no-evidence summary judgment and traditional summary judgment, suggesting no evidence supported the claims especially relating to the cause of the accident. Agara argued MBCL's service immediately prior to the accident was substantially related to the cause and cited inspection reports pre- and post-accident, her testimony, and proximity in time between service and the accident as support.

The trial court granted MBCL's no-evidence and traditional summary-judgment motions, and after denying her motion for a new trial, the case was appealed by Agara. She contested only the negligence and breach of warranty dismissals, not gross negligence.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of MBCL. In analyzing the negligence claim, the verdict will focus on the lack of proximate cause evidence to link MBCL's actions or inactions with the accident. The court requires that Agara demonstrate that MBCL's breach was a substantial factor in causing her injuries, which necessitates more than speculative or conjectural assertions based on the timing of the maintenance service and the ensuing accident. Despite the temporal proximity, the court will find no substantial evidence showing MBCL's inspection or lack thereof was the actual reason for the steering failure.

Additionally, the court will acknowledge other factors, such as weather conditions, worn-out tires, and Agaraâ€™s admission of hydroplaning, which support the assessment that MBCL's responsibility for the accident is not sufficiently substantiated. Furthermore, expert testimony discrediting the link between loss of power steering fluid and the inability to steer will further dilute her causation argument.

Regarding the breach of express and implied warranties claim, Agara will fail to prove that MBCL breached any warranties that could have led to her injuries. The court will reference that MBCL's inspection indicated the passed condition of the power steering system and that Agara herself felt the car was running smoothly post-service. The lack of evidence countering MBCL's inspection findings and the post-accident reports suggesting the fluid loss may have resulted from the collision will persuade the court that no warranty breach occurred.

Consequently, the court's reasoning will lead to the affirmation of the lower court's summary judgment dismissal of Agara's claims for negligence and breach of express and implied warranties.
