Background:
The driver, Alexis Pichardo Sr., along with his family, challenged a decision from the 17th District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, which had previously granted a take-nothing summary judgment in favor of the defendants – a company, Big Diamond, Inc, and a gas station, Diamond Shamrock Stations, Inc. This legal case emerged following an incident on November 23, 2002, when James C. Luedtke Jr., after getting gasoline at a Diamond Shamrock gas station, drove off without paying. In his attempt to escape, Luedtke ran a red light and collided with a vehicle driven by Alexis Pichardo Sr., resulting in injuries to Pichardo and his son Andrew. The rest of the family following in a separate car – Peggy Pichardo and two minors, Alexis Pichardo Jr. and Richard Anderson, witnessed the collision.

Subsequently, on November 19, 2004, the Pichardos sued Luedtke, the owner of the vehicle he was driving – Selma Ann Roberts, and Big Diamond. In response, Big Diamond filed a general denial claiming it had been misidentified and was not the operator or owner of the gas station, while Diamond Shamrock argued its defense based on statute limitations, the absence of a legal duty owed, unforecastability of Luedtke’s actions, and lack of proximate cause linking its actions to the Pichardos' injuries.

The court explored various aspects of the case including legal duty, the concept of negligence, and the foreseeability of Luedtke's subsequent criminal actions post-theft. Diamond Shamrock posited that it had negated the foreseeability element of the negligence claim by showing Luedtke's act of running the red light as a superseding cause of injury, while Big Diamond stood its ground on having no ownership or control over the gas station in question.

Verdict:
The court will reaffirm the trial court’s summary judgment for Big Diamond and Diamond Shamrock, as presaged. With regards to Big Diamond, the evidence will be deemed clear and undisputed that it did not own, or operate the gas station where the incident took place, therefore negating any possible duty owed to the Pichardos. The testimony from Doug Miller, an officer of Big Diamond, will have confirmed that while it held alcohol licenses for the associated facility, it was Diamond Shamrock that owned, constructed, and operated the gas station.

In the case of Diamond Shamrock, the crime that resulted in the Pichardos' injuries – Luedtke running the red light after stealing gasoline – will be considered unforeseeable and extraordinary rather than a normal outcome resulting from the gas station's operation. Despite Pichardos' claims, the court will find no valid evidence that Diamond Shamrock could have reasonably anticipated that not requiring prepayment for gasoline could lead to a third-party criminal act of such nature and consequence.

Additionally, there will be no record evidence showing past similar accidents, frequent gas thefts, or a high-crime area which could establish a pattern leading to a foreseeable crime. Since the Pichardos failed to provide any controverting evidence indicating foreseeability of the crime, the court will hold that Diamond Shamrock conclusively negated the foreseeability element necessary for proximate cause in a negligence claim. The decision will affirm that Diamond Shamrock’s lack of prepayment policy for gasoline did not result in a legal duty to Alexis Pichardo Sr. and his family regarding the subsequent criminal acts of a third-party off the premises.
