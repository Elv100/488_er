Background:
Jeanette Galin, the appellant, brought a survivorship and wrongful death action against Robert Packard and his company, Banjo Distributing Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as appellees), following the death of her husband, Ronald Galin. The incident occurred on July 24, 1993, when Ronald Galin drowned while fishing on Lake Medina with Packard. Both men were not wearing life preservers while fishing, and upon Galin falling into the water, Packard attempted a rescue by extending a fishing pole, throwing a rope, and finally a flotation device; all of which failed to save Galin.

The appellant sued for negligence, alleging eight specific failures on Packard's part, including not providing or using adequate flotation devices, not maintaining control of the boat or keeping it in a safe condition, inadequate rescue attempts, failing to warn, creating a hazardous condition, and operating the boat with disregard for safety. The appellant later amended the complaint to include negligence per se claims based on alleged violations of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Code.

The appellees filed a motion for summary judgment which acknowledged all of the appellant's claims but contended that these could be translated into two theories of liability: the failure to require the use of flotation devices and the failure to rescue Galin. The motion for summary judgment did not address the negligence per se claims raised in the appellant's amended petition since they were not present when the appellees filed their motion. However, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees, which was then appealed by the appellant.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. The appellate court will find that the appellees did not demonstrate entitlement to summary judgment on all the appellant's claims. Specifically, the appellees' motion failed to address the five out of eight original allegations of negligence not encompassed by their two proposed theories of liability. Consequently, the court will reason that summary judgment should not have been granted when the appellees' motion did not address each cause of action explicitly.

Additionally, the appellate court will hold that the appellees were not entitled to summary judgment on the negligence per se claims because these were added to the appellant's petition after the summary judgment motion was filed, and the appellees did not amend their motion to address these new allegations. Since the trial court's decision appeared to encompass all claims, including those not addressed in the appellees’ motion or those raised in the amendment, the court will find error in the summary judgment on this ground as well.

The appellate court will emphasize the necessity for a motion for summary judgment to expressly and completely address each cause of action claimed by the non-movant. Because several of the appellant’s negligence accusations and all of the negligence per se claims were not addressed, the appellees will fail to meet the strict standard required to grant summary judgment, leading to the reversal of the trial court's decision.
