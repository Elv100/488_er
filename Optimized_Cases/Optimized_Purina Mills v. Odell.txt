Background:
The dairy farmer plaintiff, Mike Odell, operates a 200-head dairy farm near Como, Texas, and began dairy operations in 1974. Initially, Odell mixed his own feed but switched to using a feed mix produced by defendant Purina Mills (Purina), which was sold by defendant Franklin County Feed & Supply (Franklin County) in December 1994. In an effort to increase milk production, Odell was influenced by friends to use Purina feed. The first delivery of this feed took place on December 19, 1994. Odell's feed system included a precautionary magnet to remove metal from his mixed feed, a system he continued to use after switching to Purina's products.

Shortly after introducing the Purina feed, Odell noticed declining milk production and illness in his cows. Despite various adjustments and consultations with representatives from Tri-County, which delivered the feed, and from Purina, including a manager from Purina's Fort Worth manufacturing facility and nutrition experts, Odell found metal-contaminated pellets adhering to the magnets in his feed system. Metal contaminants included metal shavings, rust, wire pieces, and staples. Repeated discoveries of metal contamination occurred with successive Purina feed deliveries through May 1995. Odell ceased Purina feed deliveries in June 1995.

Health issues in the herd included cows diagnosed with hardware disease (traumatic reticuloperitonitis) and displaced abomasum (twisted stomach), which are serious ailments afflicting cattle, potentially caused by ingestion of metal.

At trial, expert witnesses, Dr. J.D. Norris and Dr. Brian Heim, veterinarians, testified on behalf of the plaintiff, offering opinions on causation between the contaminated feed and the cows' injuries. Their testimony included acknowledgments of potential alternate sources of metal ingestion and the absence of tests excluding other causes for the cows' injuries. Despite this, the jury awarded approximately $631,000 in damages for lost market value, lost milk production, mental anguish, and attorney’s fees based on the plaintiff's percentage of the damages.

Verdict:
The judgment awarding damages to plaintiff dairy farmer Mike Odell will be reversed due to the trial court’s error in admitting testimony from the plaintiff’s expert veterinary witnesses, Dr. J.D. Norris and Dr. Brian Heim, whose scientific reliability was not adequately established in line with legal standards such as those from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. The conclusion will be drawn specifically because these experts did not test to rule out other potential causes of the diseases, did not sample the entire herd or all the delivered feed, one expert was hired merely for litigation testimony, and there was no demonstration that the experts used a reliable technique for their conclusions. 

Predictably, they will find that without the expert testimony, there is insufficient factual basis to support the jury's determination that the contaminated feed was responsible for injury to the entire herd. Therefore, the requirement is to evaluate the legal sufficiency of the evidence regarding causation which, in this case, will fall short due to the absence of comprehensive testing against all possible sources of injury and inadequate sampling of feed and affected cattle. 

Other related issues that are expected to be addressed in the new trial will include the plaintiff's failure to elect remedies among the different theories of recovery presented, as the varying theories offer different remedies. Additionally, since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp. has determined that attorney's fees under the DTPA are to be based on fees reasonably incurred and not a percentage of the recovery, the case will be remanded with directions to correct the calculation of attorney's fees accordingly, if applicable. The new trial should outline the necessity for the plaintiff to substantiate the claim with evidence upholding a reasonable medical or veterinary probability linking the contaminated feed to the herd's injury and a valuation of damages that are not speculative but grounded in evidence.
