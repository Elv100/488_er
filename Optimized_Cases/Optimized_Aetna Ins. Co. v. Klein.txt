Background:
Respondents Edward J. Klein and others engaged in a legal dispute with petitioner Aetna Insurance Company, seeking to recover damages for their building that was allegedly damaged by lightning. They claimed the building was covered by an insurance policy worth $40,000. The jury found the damage amounted to $20,000 and judgment was entered in favor of the respondents for this sum. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld the trial court's judgment. However, the insurance policy itself was not presented as evidence during the trial, leaving an unclear record on whether the omission was accidental or intentional. While petitioner—the insurer—admitted to issuing a policy covering fire, lightning, and other hazards which was in force at the time of the alleged loss, there was no proof or testimony introduced to establish the coverage amount promised under the contract.

The respondents tried to address the lack of direct proof of the coverage amount by using various procedural methods. They argued that by pleading a coverage amount and not having the insurer plead a lesser sum as an avoidance under Tex. R. Civ. P. 94, the insurer forfeited its right to contest the amount of coverage. Additionally, they suggested that the necessary proof was supplied during cross-examination or by the admission into evidence of a sworn proof of loss they executed. However, the proof of loss form had notations made by the respondents indicating coverage of $40,000.00. Despite petitioner's stance that no proper proof of loss had been furnished according to policy requirements, the trial court admitted this form without objection from the petitioner, viewing it as a compliance with policy conditions, not as confirmation of the policy amount.

Verdict:
The court will overturn the judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and the trial court and remand the case for a new trial. The reasoning for this decision hinges on the respondents' failure to establish by proof or admission the material fact of the insurance policy's coverage amount. Rule 94, requiring affirmative pleading of avoidance, will not be interpreted to include the insurer's responsibility to contradict coverage amounts in the respondents' claim. The lack of direct evidence regarding the coverage amount cannot be waived away using procedural technicalities.

The court will not accept the notion that the coverage amount was proven by inference during cross-examination—a negative witness response wiped out any such inference. The introduction into evidence of the proof of loss form, though unobjected to, will not be accepted as evidence of the coverage amount due to its nature as ex parte statements from the insured. In general, in Texas law, even unobjected incompetent evidence lacks probative force and thus cannot support a judgment.

A remand for retrial is required in the pursuit of justice since the contractual obligations are derived from the insurance policy itself, not from secondary sources like the proof of loss, and the original policy document should be readily presented as evidence. Therefore, in the absence of concrete proof of the insurer's coverage obligation, the petitioner's prior motion for an instructed verdict should have been granted, and the case must be retried with the correct evidence presented.
