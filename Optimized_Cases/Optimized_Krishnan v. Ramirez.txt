Background:
Plaintiff mother initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against defendant doctor following the death of her newborn child. The mother alleged that the defendant was negligent for not properly diagnosing and treating her preeclampsia, which she claimed led to the stillbirth. During the litigation, the mother passed away, and the case was continued by the temporary guardian of her estate and the next friend of her minor child. The defendant doctor appealed the jury’s verdict, which awarded the plaintiff damages, on the grounds of insufficient evidence regarding causation, breach of the standard of care, and mental anguish damages. The defendant also claimed errors in evidentiary rulings, jury instructions, questions, and alleged cumulative errors.

The case involved evidence related to the mother’s preeclampsia condition, the argument that the mother was denied an autopsy which could have provided conclusive evidence, testimonies on whether the standard of care was breached, and the mother's mental anguish. Additionally, there was legal debate over the proper assignees and successors to the lawsuit following the mother's death.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The court will find that there is sufficient evidence to establish the causation between the defendant’s negligence and the death of the fetus due to the preeclampsia condition. The court will conclude that the expert testimony demonstrated a causal connection based upon reasonable medical probability, and that the defendant's challenges to the evidence will be found to be insufficient, failing to either discredit the causation or firmly establish an alternative cause of death.

Regarding the breach of the standard of care, the court will conclude that the evidence sufficiently established that the defendant deviated from the normative standard treatment for preeclampsia at the time. The court will also support its affirmation by indicating that this breach led to the injury, being the death of the fetus, thus establishing two of the necessary elements for a medical malpractice claim.

On mental anguish, the court will find that the jury had ample testimony upon which to base their verdict and that the mental anguish damages were part of a reasonable compensation for the mother’s suffering. The plaintiff's mental anguish, as testified by witnesses, constituted a high degree of mental pain and distress related to the stillbirth, which qualified as part of the plaintiff’s body.

Regarding procedural and evidentiary challenges, such as arguments concerning jury instructions and admissibility of evidence, the court will determine that any errors made were not prejudicial enough to warrant a reversal. The court will find that the jury was instructed properly regarding the differentiation between compensable and non-compensable mental anguish and that the evidence presented at trial was relevant to the case.

Finally, the court will reject arguments related to cumulative error on the basis that they found no reversible individual errors. Therefore, the cumulative error doctrine will not apply, and the judgment by the lower court will be upheld.
