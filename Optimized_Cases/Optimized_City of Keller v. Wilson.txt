Background:
The City of Keller, a rapidly growing suburb of Fort Worth, Texas, approved plans for two new subdivisions, Estates of Oak Run and Rancho Serena, which included revised plans for stormwater drainage that affected the Wilsons' property but did not conform to the City's Master Drainage Plan. The Master Drainage Plan, adopted by the City in 1991, dictated that drainage easements be provided across the properties of both Z.T. Sebastian (adjacent to the Wilsons) and the Wilsons themselves, leading into the Little Bear Creek Watershed. The developers' plans included the construction of a long drainage ditch on the Sebastian property with detention basins on the subdivision properties, but they did not include any drainage easement across the Wilson property.

The City approved the plans submitted by the developers, which according to the Wilsons, led to increased flooding on their property, ruining eight acres of their farmland. The City's Director of Public Works approved the developers' plans, and the City accepted the completed works. It was uncontested that three sets of engineers certified that the revised plans conformed to the City's codes and regulations, which should have prevented an increase in downstream flooding. The Wilsons argued that the City knew the approved revised plans were substantially certain to cause flooding on their property.

For the Wilsons to recover damages for inverse condemnation, they had to prove intentional taking or damage to their property for public use by the City, or that the City was substantially certain this outcome would result. The City contended there was no evidence supporting the jury's finding of intentional taking, claiming it wholly relied on engineers' assurances that complied with the City's regulatory requirements.

The divided Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's decision in favor of the Wilsons, applying the "exclusive" standard of legal sufficiency review, which considered only evidence that tended to support the finding and disregarded all evidence to the contrary, including the engineers' certifications. The City contested this, arguing that the Court of Appeals had used the wrong scope of review. The case cites a long history of variations between the "inclusive" standard, considering all evidence in a light favorable to the verdict, and the "exclusive" standard. There is an in-depth exploration of the circumstances in which contrary evidence should either be considered or disregarded in evaluating legal sufficiency.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court of Texas reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remands the case due to the failure of properly applying the correct scope of legal-sufficiency review in connection with the intent requirement for an intentional taking under the Texas Constitution. The Supreme Court clarifies that a reviewing court must consider all evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could do so, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. The Court finds that the evidence presented by the Wilsons did not meet the required standard to demonstrate that the City intentionally took or was substantially certain to damage their property, particularly given that the City had been advised by multiple sets of engineers that the plan would not result in increased downstream flooding.

The evidence the Wilsons brought forward did not demonstrate the City knew more than what these engineering reports conveyed. Even though the City's actions might raise concerns, in the absence of proof that the City knew the advice it received was wrong, there is no evidence that the City's approval of the revised drainage plan was an intentional taking. The Court acknowledges the alternate verdict claim under the Texas Water Code but leaves it to the Court of Appeals to resolve as it was not previously addressed.

The jury finding against the City is set aside, with the rationale being that the engineers' certifications and other official assurances provided a basis upon which the City could rely, nullifying the claim of intentional or substantially certain knowledge of damage to the Wilsons' property. The Court thus remands the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration of the claim under the Texas Water Code.
