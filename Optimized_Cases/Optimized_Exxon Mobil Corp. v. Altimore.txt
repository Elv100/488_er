Background:
Louise Altimore, the wife of a lifetime Exxon employee Mike Altimore, sued Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon), alleging she was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma, a rare and almost universally fatal disease, in April 2003 because of asbestos exposure brought home on her husband's work clothing. The claim was that Exxon negligently permitted Mr. Altimore to bring home asbestos dust on his clothes, leading to Mrs. Altimore's exposure while laundering them. The jury ruled in Mrs. Altimore's favor, finding Exxon had acted negligently and with malice, awarding both actual and exemplary damages totaling $1,985,802. Post-trial, Exxon's motions for a new trial, remittitur, and to modify the judgment were overruled.

The case focused on the period between 1942, when Mr. Altimore began working at Exxon's Baytown, Texas refinery, and 1972, when he commenced employment in an air-conditioned tool room — a period identified as relevant for assessing Mrs. Altimore's exposure risks. During this time, advancements had been made in understanding the dangers of asbestos, including the association with diseases like asbestosis and lung cancer. By 1949, Exxon reportedly had identified categories of refinery workers at risk for exposure, though they did not address the issue of risk from take-home exposure.

In 1964, an epidemiological study firmly linked asbestos exposure to lung cancer and mesothelioma, indicating even minor exposure could lead to pulmonary changes, and by this time, Exxon employees had been attending conferences on asbestos-related diseases. Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, more studies concluded that asbestos exposure was causally linked to various diseases, and household exposures were identified as potentially hazardous.

By 1972, a consensus among experts suggested significant risks related to asbestos exposure, and OSHA introduced regulations to reduce workplace exposure, including prohibiting workers exposed to asbestos from wearing their work clothes home, which was understood to signal a risk to employee families for the first time.

Verdict:
The court will overrule Mrs. Altimore's motion for rehearing and en banc rehearing, withdraw the prior opinion, and issue a substitute opinion. It will reverse the trial court’s judgment and render a judgment that Mrs. Altimore take nothing. The court's reasoning will be anchored in the legal duty owed to Mrs. Altimore, with the central question being the foreseeability of the risk of her injury due to asbestos dust carried home by her husband on Exxon-issued clothing.

The court will find that despite the increasing body of knowledge over time indicating the risks of asbestos exposure, the specific risk to a worker's spouse from take-home asbestos was not sufficiently foreseeable to Exxon. The court will emphasize that while there was general awareness of the harmful effects of asbestos by 1972, only then -- coinciding with OSHA regulations -- was Exxon put on notice about take-home asbestos risks. However, by this time, Mr. Altimore had already transitioned to a non-asbestos-exposed environment (air-conditioned tool room). The court will conclude that during the relevant period when Mrs. Altimore could have been exposed (1942-1972), Exxon did not have a duty of care towards her, because the risk was not foreseeable within this timeframe.

The verdict will not deny asbestos exposure risks or dismiss scientific findings, but rather decide on the narrow issue of Exxon's legal duty to Mrs. Altimore. It will tie the establishment of duty to the point at which Exxon became, or should have become, aware of the risk of at-home asbestos exposure to spouses of employees. Since this awareness was not established until after Mr. Altimore ceased working in asbestos-exposing conditions, Exxon's duty to Mrs. Altimore to prevent her illness did not exist. Therefore, the court will support Exxon's appeal based on the absence of duty, rendering Mrs. Altimore's claim void.
