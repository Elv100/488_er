Background:
Raquel Reyes Martinez, hereafter referred to as Martinez, sued the City of Brownsville following the suicide of her son, Roberto Martinez Reyes, referred to as Reyes, in the Brownsville City Jail. Reyes, who suffered from schizophrenia, was arrested for intoxication by paint and subsequently jailed. The jail staff knew Reyes and were aware of his suicide risk, as indicated by prior incarcerations and actions taken during those incarcerations. Despite this knowledge, Reyes was placed in a regular single cell rather than a padded cell, and he was not provided with tear-away paper garments designed for suicide risks. Instead, he retained his standard clothing. Reyes repeatedly asked for his psychiatric medication during his incarceration, displaying signs of being disturbed. His medication was delivered to the jail by his case manager, Ricardo Vargas, who emphasized the importance of administering it. However, the jail staff did not give Reyes the medication. Later, Reyes hung himself with his shirt using the bars of his cell door. Although the cells were under surveillance by camera, his act of suicide was not observed by the jail staff, with differing testimonies regarding the coverage and focus of the cameras.

Both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment motions were filed by the city, claiming sovereign immunity. The 197th District Court of Cameron County, Texas, granted the summary judgment in favor of the city without specifying the basis of its decision, leading Martinez to appeal. She argued that the city waived its immunity because her son’s death was caused by a condition or use of tangible property owned by the city. The City of Brownsville rebutted that Reyes's negligent use of the cell door, not a government employee's, could not lead to the waiver of sovereign immunity.

Verdict:
Considering the case, the appeals court will likely reverse the lower court's summary judgment ruling in favor of the City of Brownsville. The court will adjudicate that the City of Brownsville did not establish the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity as a matter of law. The ruling will be based on the facts that the jail staff failed to take adequate precautions to prevent Reyes, a known suicide risk, from harming himself, despite several means and regulations to prevent such an incident. The court will distinguish between the negligent formulation of policy (which retains sovereign immunity) and the negligent implementation of policy (which does not), finding substantial evidence that the city staff negligently implemented existing policies regarding inmate surveillance, issuance of safe clothing, and administration of medication.

The city’s use of tangible property (the cell and Reyes’s clothing) without necessary safety components (tear-away paper garments and medication administration procedures), coupled with their knowledge of Reyes’s suicidal risk and failure to follow established procedures, will be deemed a proximate cause of Reyes’s death. The court will likely emphasize that the jail provided Reyes with a condition to facilitate his suicide by placing him in a cell with bars accessible with his regular clothing, contrary to their own policies for managing suicide-risk inmates. 

The appeals court will remand the case for further proceedings, determining that the city failed to conclusively prove that Martinez's claims were barred by sovereign immunity, statute of limitations, lack of evidence of waiver of sovereign immunity, or affirmative defense under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section 93.001. Thus, the lawsuit will proceed to the trial stage for further developments.
