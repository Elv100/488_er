Background:
Appellant, a company engaged in curing hides, was operating in a city section designated for slaughterhouses and similar industries. The appellee, a father, filed a lawsuit against the company claiming it was a nuisance and contributed to his daughter's death. The daughter, who was 25 years old and suffered from asthma, died from disease and malarial fever allegedly caused by exposure to conditions created by the company's business. Physicians testified that the fever was caused by mosquitoes, and others elaborated on the harmful health effects resulting from decaying organic matter and the use of chemicals in the hide-curing process. Five physicians provided expert testimony at trial.

The appellant's business practices included handling hides in a green state, allowing flesh to rot, and creating conditions that attracted flies and mosquitoes, and resulted in an emission of foul odors. This environment was claimed to have resulted in the sickness and subsequent death of the daughter. The father alleged her death was a result of breathing the "poisoned atmosphere" emanating from the hide-curing process and sought damages for the loss of her labor in his household. The company argued it operated lawfully, exercised due care, and that the father knowingly moved into the area. After a jury trial, the lower court awarded the father a verdict in favor of $1,000 in damages.

Verdict:
The verdict will affirm the judgment based on the proximate cause principle. The proximate cause doesn't necessarily need to be the last or sole cause of harm—rather, it must be a significant contributing factor that could reasonably have been foreseen as leading to the result under the given circumstances. In this instance, the hide-curing operation and its attendant noxious atmosphere will be recognized as a proximate cause of the daughter's death, as the conditions reasonably could have been anticipated to harm the health of those in the vicinity.

The lawful nature of the company's business and the city's authorization for such an operation in the specified locality will not serve as a defense if the business practices resulted in harmful consequences to life, health, or property. It is irrelevant that the business was necessary and useful to the community or that the father moved to the area after the establishment of the business; neither will absolve the company from liability for creating a nuisance.

Suffering from such a nuisance will be considered a legitimate element of damages, and recovery for sickness resulting from the nuisance will be allowed. The statutes will permit an action for actual damages where death is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, or default of another. The daughter in this case could have maintained an action for injury to her health, and hence, after her death due to said injury, the father was entitled to sue for damages resulting to him.

The detailed testimonies and evidence provided by medical experts will establish a reliable connection between the company's practices and the decaying atmosphere, supporting the court’s conclusions. It will be agreed upon that breathing air laden with decay from the company's operations was detrimental to the deceased's health, weakening her to the point where she could not withstand the onset of malarial fever.

Overall, the evidence will be considered sufficient to establish the company's culpability, and the jury's determination will be respected for its assessment of evidence and factual findings. The company’s appeal will ultimately be dismissed, and the lower court's judgment upheld.
