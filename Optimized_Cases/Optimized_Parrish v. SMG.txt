Background:
The Harris County Sports & Convention Corporation owns NRG Park, which includes NRG Stadium, NRG Center, and NRG Arena. SMG, a management company, was hired to oversee the operations of NRG Park. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (the Rodeo) operates the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo at NRG Park for three weeks each March under a lease agreement with Harris County.

As part of their operations, SMG was required to install rubber mats on the concrete floors of the NRG Center. When not in use, these mats were rolled up and stored. During the event's preparations, the Rodeo would direct SMG on where to place the mats, and SMG would unroll them and tape the ends to one another with industrial duct tape. The bottom of the mats was not adhered to the concrete. The Rodeo was contractually responsible for maintaining the mats once the event started, but SMG personnel would also assist. Both sets of personnel replaced any duct tape that had lost adhesion during the event.

Jimaree Parrish, a Rodeo patron, attended the event on March 15, 2014, and tripped and fell on a curled-up corner of a rubber floor mat, sustaining serious injuries. She alleged that the curled-up mat was hidden by sawdust and wood shavings. Parrish sued the Rodeo and later added SMG as a defendant, presenting claims for negligence and premises liability. She accused the Rodeo and SMG of failing to keep the floor panels level and covered with sawdust that obscured defects, inadequately maintaining and securing floor panels, and failing to warn about the uneven floor.

SMG moved for traditional and no-evidence summary judgment, asserting that it owed no duty to Parrish because the Rodeo was in control of the premises at the time of the injuries, and that there was no evidence of a negligent activity contemporaneous with Parrish’s injury. SMG argued that Parrish could not establish that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition. Both Michael DeMarco and Richard Fredette testified that they were unaware of previous instances where patrons tripped over the floor mats or mats curled due to duct tape coming undone.

Parrish responded, arguing that SMG should have used more durable installation methods in line with the manufacturer's recommendations that would have prevented the risk of the mats curling. She pointed out that SMG had provided duct tape to the Rodeo and that SMG and Rodeo personnel constantly replaced the tape, implying awareness of its potential to fail. Parrish also submitted affidavits from witnesses present at the time of the incident and from an engineer to support her claims that SMG knew of the danger and that a safer installation method should have been used. However, she presented no evidence demonstrating that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of the specific dangerous condition that caused her injury—i.e., the exact mat that she tripped over—or that it had existed for a sufficient length of time for SMG to have discovered and addressed it.

Verdict:
Summary judgment in favor of SMG was affirmed based on the determination that Parrish failed to present evidence that SMG had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition—that is, the specific curled-up floor mat that caused her injuries. SMG was aware that industrial duct tape might lose adhesion over time, leading to potential mat curls, but knowledge of a possible issue does not constitute actual knowledge of a specific existing danger. Thus, Parrish's claim that SMG was negligent in its failure to use a more secure method than duct tape to fix the mats to the floor did not establish that at the time of her injury, SMG was actually aware that the particular mat she tripped on posed a risk.

Further, no evidence was presented to indicate that the condition existed long enough for SMG to have reasonably discovered it through an inspection. The lack of temporal evidence and specific knowledge about the condition that caused Parrish's injury negates SMG's ability to foresee and prevent the risk. This absence of concrete details relating to the duration and visibility of the curled-up mat fails to meet the requirement of constructive knowledge, a necessary element to hold SMG liable under premises liability law.

Additionally, Parrish argued that SMG had a duty resulting from alleged negligent work performed on the property because it supplied duct tape for use and assisted with its replacement during the rodeo event. Still, there was no evidence indicating that SMG performed any such work in direct relation to the mat in question prior to the incident.

In conclusion, based on the evidence presented, Parrish did not raise a fact issue against SMG for the knowledge of the dangerous condition. The duties she alleged were unmet by SMG could not be substantiated due to lack of demonstrable knowledge of the specific hazard that led to her fall. As a result, the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for SMG on the premises liability claims was deemed proper.
