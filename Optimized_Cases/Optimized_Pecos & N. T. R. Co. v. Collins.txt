Background:
The appellant in this case is the Pecos & Northern Texas Railway Company, and the appellee is Robert Collins, a former employee of the railway company. Collins was employed as a section foreman and was required to handle and unload railway ties that had been treated with a chemical solution known as creosote. On May 27, 1912, while unloading wet, creosoted ties, Collins' hands and face began to burn, and his skin was consequently damaged. Collins was unaware of the risks associated with handling creosoted ties, as he had never worked with such ties in the wet state before. Conversely, the railway company argued they were unaware that the creosote could cause such injuries when contacting the skin.

Collins alleged that the railway company knew or should have known that the ties were dangerous and that handling them could result in poisoning. He claimed the company negligently failed to warn him of this danger, leading to his injuries and subsequent health issues such as swelling, feverish limbs, paralysis, constant headaches, dizzy and numb spells, as well as damage to his back, kidneys, intestines, and other internal organs. Moreover, he contended that his nervous system was severely affected, causing him to suffer both mentally and physically, with an impact on his earning capacity and quality of life.

The jury initially found in favor of Collins, and the railway company's motion for a new trial was overruled by the trial court. The company contended that the trial court erred in not granting a peremptory charge (a direction to enter a particular verdict) and that the evidence did not show the company was aware of the potential for systemic injury from external contact with creosote. Expert testimonies during the trial were mixed, with some supporting the possibility that creosote could cause systemic poisoning and others arguing that the symptoms Collins experienced were not typical of creosote poisoning and could be attributed to another illness, such as pellagra—a conclusion the railway company's medical experts reached.

Moreover, witnesses who had handled creosoted ties in the past testified that they had never suffered injuries beyond minor skin burns. The evidence presented showed that creosote was known to cause burns when it came into contact with the skin but typically did not result in the sort of systemic poisoning that Collins experienced. It was also noted that Collins' symptoms were indicative of the disease pellagra and he hadn't handled wet creosoted ties before this incident.

Verdict:
The court in the end reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of Collins. The justification will likely hinge on the distinction between the apparent risks associated with handling creosote, which could have been known by the railway company—like the potential for skin burns—and the unforeseen systemic health issues that Collins experienced. There was an absence of evidence to suggest that the railway company knew or should have known that handling creosote could lead to systemic poisoning, a condition not reported in medical literature or previously observed as a consequence of external creosote exposure.

Though Collins was found to have suffered serious constitutional disorders due to his exposure to creosote, the injuries for which he could seek compensation were limited to those that the railway company could reasonably have anticipated from such exposure. The verdict did not necessarily dispute that Collins suffered from his health conditions, but rather that such outcomes were not predictable effects of handling creosote, and as such, the railway company was not expected to warn employees about risks that were not reasonably foreseeable.

Based on the evidence and testimony presented, the court will likely reason that the railway company could not be found negligent for failing to anticipate a rare constitutional injury that had not been documented prior to this case and was not a known probable consequence of external creosote exposure. As a result, the court will probably support its reversal by emphasizing the principle that an employer is not liable for unforeseen and atypical consequences of their acts that could not have been foreseen as the usual and probable result of negligence. Consequently, Collins might be entitled to damages only for the skin burns caused by creosote but not for the more severe and unexpected health issues he experienced. Given this, the case will be remanded for a new trial where Collins can pursue damages that are deemed reasonably foreseeable by the court based on the nature of creosote and the information available to the railway company at the time.
