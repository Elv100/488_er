Background:
The case involves a wrongful death action against a county mental hospital and its employees. In July 1988, Roger Bossley, who was suffering from major depression and had previously attempted suicide, was admitted to Hillside Center, owned and operated by Dallas County Mental Health and Mental Retardation (Dallas MHMR). Hillside is an "open" facility that normally allows patients significant freedom of movement.

On August 9, Bossley expressed a desire to procure a gun for suicide. This prompted his treating physician, Dr. Urschel, to deem him "a definite risk to himself." A transfer back to a more restrictive Mental Diagnostic Center was ordered for further evaluation, given his continued suicidal ideation. Hillside had a practice of locking the front door when transfers were pending to a more restrictive environment. Therefore, following the order for Bossley's transfer, the outer door was locked. However, no suicide or elopement precautions were explicitly ordered, and the inner glass door remained unlocked.

Despite observations and discussions among Dallas MHMR staff about Bossley's fear of being transferred and potential escape risk, he was not constantly monitored. Angela Jones, a Hillside employee aware of Bossley’s restrictions, did not alert others to watch him as she unlocked and opened the outer door to leave for lunch. Concurrently, Bossley overpowered Jones, escaped the facility, and eventually ran across a highway where he was struck and killed by a truck.

A wrongful death action was filed by the decedent's estate against the county mental hospital and employees, alleging negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees based on governmental immunity. Appellants, representatives of the estate, contended that the employees were exercising medical rather than governmental discretion, and that the claims involved the condition of property, specifically the unlocked doors, thereby constituting an exception to governmental immunity.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's summary judgment grant to appellee Dallas MHMR. The court will hold that governmental immunity does not apply in this instance because the alleged negligent conduct involved a "condition" of the property, namely the unlocked doors, rather than nonuse of the property. Additionally, the appellees were found to be employing medical, as opposed to governmental, discretion in their actions, which further validates the exception to governmental immunity.

The court will determine that there is a significant distinction between medical and governmental discretion. The decision-making involved in the care and treatment of Roger Bossley will be determined to be medical discretion. The officials' conduct regarding Bossley's transfer and failure to secure the doors will be construed as involving the use and condition of tangible property, namely the doors of the facility. It will be concluded that Hillside’s failure to ensure the inner door was locked constituted a condition presenting a defect for its intended purpose, making the property itself part of the negligence claim. This will be paralleled with previous case law where the failure to provide protective equipment or adequate resources was deemed a 'condition' or 'use' of tangible property, meaning the government unit could be liable if it were a private individual under the same circumstances.

The court will forecast that appellees failed to conclusively establish that Roger's death could not have been caused by the condition or use of tangible property. Therefore, summary judgment based on governmental immunity will be proscribed. The court will also resolve that appellees did not conclusively prove that they employed governmental discretion to merit official immunity.

For proximate cause, the court will posit that appellants have raised genuine issues of material fact, emphasizing that the risk of Roger's suicide was foreseeable and recognizing the negligence in failing to enforce proper suicide precautions.

Finally, the court will deem the matter of the statutory cap on damages as not ripe for resolution, as it is contingent on a finding of liability which has yet to be established.

In summary, the court will reverse the previous decision and remand the case for further proceedings in line with its reasoning, reflecting legal interpretations regarding the conditions and use of property under the Texas Tort Claims Act and the separation between medical and governmental discretion within the context of official immunity.
