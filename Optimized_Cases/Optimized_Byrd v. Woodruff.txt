Background:
Kassie Renee Byrd, a minor, was involved in a lawn mower accident leading to two separate lawsuits. One suit was in the 199th Judicial District Court of Collin County, Texas (Collin County suit), and the other in the 134th District Court of Dallas County, Texas (Dallas County suit). In the Dallas County suit, Jay Downs was appointed as Kassie's guardian ad litem, but he did not participate in the Collin County suit. Multiple settlements were reached, including a $10,000 settlement with Dr. Smilack ($4,000 apportioned to Kassie), a $45,000 settlement with Humana ($19,000 apportioned to Kassie), and a $250,000 joint settlement with Drs. Rosen and Glidden ($97,038.67 apportioned to Kassie). These settlements were approved following prove-up hearings.

Ten days after reaching the age of majority, Kassie and Stephen and Debbie Byrd (her father and stepmother) arranged for a trust agreement with Katherine Woodruff, her attorney, for Kassie's benefit. The agreement included proceeds from the settlements and an additional $12,500 plus interest from the Collin County suit. However, checks from both Collin and Dallas County suits intended for Kassie were alleged to have been misappropriated by Debbie Byrd.

Kassie filed a lawsuit against Woodruff, her former and current law firms, Downs, and his law firm, alleging negligence in the representation, mishandling of settlement proceeds, establishment of the trust, lack of advisement on the trust's validity, and failure to ensure compliance with Texas Property Code. Downs and Woodruff both moved for summary judgment without challenging Kassie's second amended petition. The district court granted summary judgment for all defendants without specifying the grounds for its ruling. Kassie non-suited some claims, leaving others for appeal.

Verdict:
Based on existing legal precedent and the facts presented, the court is likely to affirm summary judgment for post-judgment claims against Downs regarding the creation and execution of the trust, as well as the disbursement of settlements, since no duty was owed by Downs after the final judgment. Similarly, Woodruff will likely receive affirmation for summary judgment on claims related to the apportionment of proceeds from the Rosen & Glidden settlement based on the final court-approved allocation.

Conversely, the court will likely reverse summary judgment granted to Downs and Woodruff on all other claims since they did not provide conclusive evidence or address these claims in their motions for summary judgment. Specifically, the court will find that Downs breached his fiduciary duties by not providing evidence of prudent action in handling the settlement proceeds, such as failing to request that the Humana proceeds be placed in an interest-bearing account. The court will also conclude that absolute judicial immunity does not protect Downs, as he was not acting as an arm of the court but rather as Kassieâ€™s personal representative.

The court will hold that no attorney-client relationship existed between Kassie and Downs, absolving Downs from claims of attorney malpractice. However, the court will reject the application of estoppel and collateral estoppel since Kassie did not directly challenge the settlements or their reasonableness.

Lastly, the court will determine that Downs and Woodruff are entitled to credits against any damages for amounts already recovered by Kassie from prior settlements to prevent double recovery, with specific amounts credited for the Smilack and Humana settlements.
