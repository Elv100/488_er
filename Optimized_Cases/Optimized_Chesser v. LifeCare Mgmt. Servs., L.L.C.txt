Background: 
Curtis Chesser, a Fort Worth Police Officer, suffered a mild stroke affecting his swallowing ability. Initially treated at Huguley Hospital and Granbury Hospital, he was subsequently transferred to the LifeCare Hospital of Fort Worth (Hospital), a long-term acute care facility managed by LifeCare Management Services, L.L.C. (LMS), for rehabilitation and therapy. While at Hospital, Chesser was treated by Drs. Ade Adedokun, Edward Ferree, and Burke DeLange.

Several days after his admission, Dr. DeLange, along with nurses Carol Smith and Cindy Barnett, performed a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion through his abdominal wall into his stomach. Post-insertion, Chesser reported severe abdominal pain, rating it at 10 on a scale of 1-10. His condition deteriorated over the next four days, as his complaints and their cause went unaddressed. Chesser requested a transfer to a full-service hospital after he excreted a significant amount of blood and his blood pressure dropped dangerously low. He was transferred to Harris Hospital, where an endoscopy revealed a large ulcer on his stomach lining, blood in his stomach, active bleeding from the epigastric artery, and resulted in a cardiopulmonary arrest along with sustained permanent cognitive deficits. Chesser received outpatient brain injury services thereafter and continued to require various health care treatments and services.

Chesser, through his spouse and power of attorney, Ava Chesser, filed a health care liability suit against Appellees LMS and the Hospital. He also asserted negligence against the three doctors, who settled before trial. The case went to a jury trial in the 236th District Court of Tarrant County, Texas.

During the trial, it was revealed that no policies or procedures had been devised for post-PEG insertion patients, leading to Chesser's condition going unchecked. There were no expert testimonies provided concerning the standard of care for the three settling doctors, any breach of that standard of care, or that any such breach was a proximate cause of Chesser's damages. Despite this, the trial court submitted the issue of the settling doctors' negligence to the jury to apportion damages, should liability be found, under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 33.003(b) (2008).

Other key points included evidence that no nursing plan was devised for Chesser, resulting in his decline; the settling defendants paid $183,000 in damages and $48,334 in costs to settle Chesser's claims against them, and before trial, Appellees elected the percentage settlement credit; the jury awarded a total responsibility percentage of 10% to the settling defendants, and the trial court's judgment applied a settlement credit of $377,383.53.

Additionally, the jury found a joint enterprise between LMS and Hospital, attributing 30% responsibility to LMS and 60% to the Hospital, and accordingly imposed joint and several liability on them in the final judgment. This finding carried implications for the applicability of statutory caps on noneconomic damages and the responsibilities of LMS and Hospital to pay for those damages.

Verdict:
The appellate court will determine that the trial court erred in submitting the issue of the negligence of the three doctors who settled to the jury for the purpose of apportioning damages. This mistake is due to the lack of legally sufficient evidence of their negligence, specifically the absence of expert testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to those doctors, evidence of any breach of such a standard of care, and evidence that any such breach was a proximate cause of Chesser's damages. The appellate court will consequently hold that the issue regarding the settling doctors' percentage of responsibility should not have been submitted, and no percent of responsibility should have been attributed to them by the jury. As a result, the percentage-of-responsibility settlement credit elected by the Appellees will be deemed erroneously applied, and the court will modify the judgment to reflect a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit of $183,000 instead of the previously applied 10% settlement credit of $377,383.53.

Additionally, the appellate court will find there is no evidence of a community of pecuniary interest in the common purpose of the enterprise between LMS and Hospital, rendering evidence legally insufficient to support the jury's finding of a joint enterprise. Therefore, LMS will not be jointly and severally liable for the entire judgment but only 30% responsible as found by the jury. This will also modify the judgment to reflect that Hospital and LMS are each severally liable for $250,000 in noneconomic damages, reflecting the statutory cap per the civil practices and remedies code. 

Regarding the award for prejudgment interest on past noneconomic damages, the appellate court will hold that prejudgment interest is not included in the statutory limit set forth in section 74.301 of the civil practice and remedies code and does not constitute a form of noneconomic damages but rather pecuniary loss for the loss of the use of money. Therefore, the court will affirm the awarding of prejudgment interest as not conflicting with the relevant statutes.

Lastly, the court will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when ordering a specific annuity to fund periodic payments for Chesser’s future medical expenses since it was backed by legislation permitting the arrangement and was not contested at the lower court level by Appellees. The judgment will remain affirmed for the areas not modified or reversed.
