Background:
Cecil Blan was found slumped over in the shower by his family and was rushed to the emergency room of Memorial City Hospital on July 18, 1994. Blan, 54 years old at the time, had a history of systematic lupus erthematosus and a prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA), or stroke. Blan's wife immediately informed Dr. Ali, a cardiologist who Blan had visited a few days prior. Dr. Ali consulted by phone with Dr. Bartasis, the emergency room physician, and instructed him to call a neurologist. After administering tests, hospital staff admitted Blan under Dr. Ali's care, and Blan suffered another stroke that afternoon.

The Blans filed a medical malpractice suit against both Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis. The appellants alleged Dr. Ali was negligent in several ways, including failing to properly investigate Blan's medical history, not examining Blan in person, delaying treatment, and not securing a timely examination by a neurologist or admitting Blan to the ICU promptly. Allegations against Dr. Bartasis included delaying treatment and negligent monitoring.

To substantiate their claim, the Blans relied on the affidavit of Dr. Reisbord, a neurologist with over 35 years of experience and over 20 years as a board-certified neurologist. Dr. Reisbord testified that the standard of care he described in his affidavit applied to "any physician, regardless of his/her area of expertise, that undertakes to treat and care for a patient suffering from a stroke." However, during a deposition, Dr. Reisbord acknowledged he had no knowledge of the standard of care for emergency medicine physicians or cardiologists. The trial court struck down his testimony regarding the standard of care for these specialties and granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis, as the Blans offered no evidence on the element of proximate cause.

Verdict:
The appellate court will affirm the judgment that Dr. Reisbord had the necessary knowledge to testify on the standard of care for cardiology and emergency medicine because he could describe the general standard applying to treating stroke patients, which includes some aspects relevant to the specialties in question. Nonetheless, it will be predicted that the appellate court will also find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment based on the Blans' failure to provide evidence for the causation element of their negligence claim â€“ a critical component in a medical malpractice lawsuit to avoid summary judgment.

The court will reason that Dr. Reisbord's affidavit lacked vital details on how the alleged negligence caused Blan's deterioration, which potential treatments could have led to a better outcome, or why these could have led to improvement. As the affidavit was considered conclusory and insufficient to create a fact issue on causation, the claim will not survive summary judgment. The court will also dismiss the testimony of Mary Blan, the wife of Cecil Blan, as it did not directly establish that the alleged negligence by Dr. Ali and Dr. Bartasis was the proximate cause of Blan's injuries, but merely established that Blan did not contribute to his own stroke. With the lack of evidence of proximate cause in response to the appellees' summary judgment motions, the verdict will be that Drs. Ali and Bartasis were rightfully entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of proximate cause, and the trial court's decision will be upheld.
