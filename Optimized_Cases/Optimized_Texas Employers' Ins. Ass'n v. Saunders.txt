Background:
On February 8, 1972, James E. Saunders suffered a serious back injury after slipping in mud at his workplace. He underwent a lumbar laminectomy and later received treatment for thrombophlebitis of the left leg. Despite the medical interventions, Saunders was unable to return to work due to intense pain, for which his doctors prescribed several painkillers, including Valium, Darvon N, Phenaphen #3, and Soma. Over time, Saunders' condition deteriorated; he became more withdrawn and increasingly relied on his prescribed medication, consuming multiple pills at a time. On September 24, 1972, after being observed taking his medication, Saunders died from a self-inflicted shotgun wound while his family was away at church.

Medical expert Dr. Doak testified about the impact of Saunders' medications and his consequent mental state. Dr. Doak stated that the combination of Saunders' medications, pain, and disability likely led to a profound emotional depression. He noted that the medications could seriously impair judgment, induce a state of mind to perform actions otherwise unlikely to be undertaken, and possibly lead Saunders to commit suicide.

Following the denial of compensation by the Industrial Accident Board, Saunders' spouse filed a lawsuit seeking death benefits. The jury concluded that Saunders' work-related injury and subsequent medical treatment had caused such derangement that he committed suicide due to an uncontrollable impulse, and without a willful or voluntary intent to harm himself.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the trial court's judgment that awarded death benefits to Saunders' spouse. The court reasons that, although there is evidence suggesting Saunders' injury and medical treatment were a contributing cause to his suicide, the evidence does not satisfy the legal standard set by the case Jones v. Traders & General Ins. Co. For the beneficiaries to recover death benefits due to suicide under this rule, it needs to be shown that the decedent took their own life as a result of an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy without conscious volition. The court finds that the testimony of Saunders' behavior and the expert medical opinion provided by Dr. Doak do not conclusively demonstrate an uncontrollable impulse or a delirium of frenzy that lacks conscious volition; rather, they suggest the suicide was a result of a loss of judgment or an irrational impulse akin to an intoxicated act.

It is determined that the decedent's act of suicide, although related to the distortion of values and impairment of judgment caused by the medications and his condition, still involved conscious action. Therefore, despite the fact that Saunders' medicated state and emotional turmoil influenced his decision, it cannot be categorically stated that he acted without any conscious volition or in a state of frenzy that would legally disconnect the chain of causation required for death benefits under workers' compensation law.

The Texas Workers' Compensation Act does not permit recovery of death benefits for a suicide that is the result of a voluntary and willful act, even if influenced by a disordered state of mind attributable to a work-related injury and subsequent treatment. As such, the absence of concrete evidence for an uncontrollable impulse or delirium of frenzy without conscious volition leads to the verdict that the death benefits cannot be awarded. The court will render a decision denying the claim for compensation.
