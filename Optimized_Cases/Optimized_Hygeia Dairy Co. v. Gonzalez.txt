Background:
Hygeia Dairy Co. ("Hygeia") sold 51 heads of dairy cattle to Abelardo Gonzalez in April 1991, which were then incorporated into Gonzalez's existing herd. Gonzalez later purchased additional cattle from another supplier. In 1993 and 1994, cattle in Gonzalez's herd began dying, leading to a total herd liquidation at the end of 1994. Gonzalez sued Hygeia for negligence and gross negligence for failing to disclose that Hygeia’s herd contained diseased cattle. During the trial, a jury found Hygeia negligent and grossly negligent, attributing 35% contributory negligence to Gonzalez and assessing actual damages at $291,000 and punitive damages at $3,000,000. The trial court reformed the punitive damage award to align with Texas law, offset Gonzalez's contributory negligence from actual damages, and awarded $1,419,501.98, including prejudgment interest.

Hygeia's appeal raised four points of contention: 1) error in failing to instruct the jury on mitigation of damages, 2) insufficiency of evidence supporting the gross negligence finding, 3) lack of duty to disclose common cattle diseases, and 4) inaccuracies in the trial record. The appeals court noted Hygeia was liable for selling diseased cattle but found Hygeia was entitled to an instruction on mitigation of damages, meaning a new trial was necessary.

Detailed facts about the cattle purchase, diseases, herd management, and evidence presented at trial underline the substantial losses and production issues faced by Gonzalez, the realization of disease presence in the herd sold by Hygeia, and the subsequent legal proceedings. Experts testified about the management of diseases and the impact on Gonzalez's herd, while the record accuracy and the broader question of Hygeia’s duty to disclose herd diseases were contested.

Verdict:
The appeals court is expected to affirm the trial court's ruling in part, recognizing that Hygeia had a duty to disclose communicable diseases known to substantially harm the productivity of the buyer's herd. Affirmation of the duty to disclose is based on the evidence indicating that Gonzalez sought healthy cows, combined with expert testimony suggesting that a reasonably prudent dairy farmer would disclose diseases such as Johne's disease due to transmission risks and eradication difficulties.

However, the court will also reverse and remand in part, specifically concerning Hygeia's contention on the issue of mitigation of damages. The court will find that the evidence presented should have entitled Hygeia to an instruction on the mitigation of damages for the jury to consider, as the trial evidence showed that Gonzalez had not taken all reasonable measures to understand and control the spread of disease in his herd after the cattle purchase. The trial court's refusal to submit a jury instruction on mitigation of damages will be deemed an error because evidence indicated that a reasonably prudent dairy farmer in Gonzalez's position would have taken additional steps, including testing and autopsies, to minimize losses, which Gonzalez failed to do.

In summary, Hygeia's failure to disclose known communicable diseases in its herd upholds the duty to disclose finding, but the trial court's omission of a mitigation instruction warrants a new trial where jury considerations include Gonzalez's potential contributory negligence in failing to mitigate damages post-discovery of the diseases in his herd.
