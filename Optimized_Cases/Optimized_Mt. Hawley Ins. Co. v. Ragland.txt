Background:
Howard Ragland, doing business as Lightning Laydown, was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy by Mt. Hawley Insurance Company with limits of $300,000. On March 11, 1985, a trailer rig being towed by a Lightning Laydown employee became detached, crossed into oncoming traffic, and caused an accident that resulted in the death of Jose Trevino. The Trevino family filed a lawsuit in Travis County against Lightning Laydown seeking $65 million in damages, alleging negligence on the part of Ragland's employees. General Accident Insurance Company defended Ragland without reservation of rights.

Ragland subsequently notified Mt. Hawley of the lawsuit and requested a defense, which Mt. Hawley denied, citing policy exclusions and the claim falling outside the covered policy hazards. The Trevino claim eventually settled, and Ragland entered into a Mary Carter agreement with the Trevinos, requiring payment of $300,000, less any recovery from International Bank of Commerce, another defendant. The jury found several parties, including Lightning Laydown, to be negligent and awarded the Trevinos $110,300 to be paid by the International Bank of Commerce.

Ragland, with the proceeds assigned from General Accident, pursued a legal claim against Mt. Hawley for failing to defend and indemnify him in the Trevino case, asserting multiple causes of action, including breach of contract and duty of good faith and fair dealing. Mt. Hawley answered with a general denial. Ragland then filed a motion to strike Mt. Hawley's answer due to non-compliance with the financial responsibility requirement, under article 1.36, ยง 11(a) of the Texas Insurance Code. The court ordered Mt. Hawley to post a $2,000,000 bond by a given deadline, which Mt. Hawley failed to do, leading to an interlocutory default judgment against them.

The case went to a jury to determine damages, resulting in a jury verdict for Ragland including $4,000,000 in exemplary damages and one-third of Ragland's recovery as attorney's fees. Mt. Hawley contended that the financial responsibility requirement did not apply to them and argued against the damages award on several grounds, including challenges to the award of exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and the exclusion of evidence regarding General Accident's payment of claims.

Verdict:
The court will affirm the judgment of the trial court. 

Mt. Hawley, as a surplus lines insurer, will be considered as an "unauthorized insurer" under Texas law, making the financial responsibility requirement applicable to them. Their failure to post the required bond will be deemed justifiable grounds for the court to strike their pleadings and render a default judgment. It will be argued that Mt. Hawley had constructive notice of their responsibilities under Texas law and made no efforts to file the required bond even after their answer was struck. Therefore, the trial court did not err.

Regarding the actual and exemplary damages awarded, the court will find that the default judgment and stipulations suffice to establish Ragland's actual damages incurred due to Mt. Hawley's breach of contract and duty of good faith and fair dealing. The collateral source rule will apply, since Mt. Hawley was not privy to Ragland's contract with General Accident. Consequently, Mt. Hawley should not benefit from the payments General Accident made on Ragland's behalf.

As for the one-third attorney's fees awarded, evidence deemed the fee usual, customary, and reasonable, supporting the award. The submission of attorney's fees as a percentage of the recovery is not improper as long as it is proved to be a reasonable fee, which in this case, has been.

Finally, Ragland's jury arguments will be considered permissible as inferences drawn from evidence presented at trial, and even if not, they likely did not cause rendition of an improper judgment. As none of Mt. Hawley's points of error will be sustained, the court's decision will be to affirm the trial court's judgment awarding damages to Ragland.
