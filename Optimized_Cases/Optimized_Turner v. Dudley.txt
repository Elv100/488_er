Background:
The case involves a boundary dispute that escalated into an unneighborly fight between Bradford Turner and Jim Dudley. Bradford and his wife, Pat Turner, sued Jim and his wife, Mary Dudley, for assault, trespass, and a declaratory judgment concerning the overuse of an easement by the Dudleys. The Dudleys counterclaimed for damages to Jim's back and leg resulting from the assault. A jury sided with the Dudleys regarding the easement’s placement and use, which had been in place since they acquired the property in 1979, and found Bradford guilty of assaulting Jim. The trial court's judgment awarded Jim $57,764.58 in damages for the assault, encompassing medical bills and compensation for physical and mental suffering. The judgment referred to a 1946 case which had previously established a 24-foot easement for the Dudleys’ predecessors and an agreed 2008 judgment that resolved disputes and defined easement usage rights, preventing the Turners from interfering. The current trial court also ordered a modern survey of the roadway's actual placement, aligning it with previous adjudications regarding the easement.

On appeal, the Turners challenged the award of damages for the assault (disputing the causal relationship between the fight and Jim’s medical conditions) and contested the easement claims, arguing that the trial court essentially granted a new easement by prescription over their land. The Turners contended that the prior judgments did not entail the easement they were accused of infringing upon. It was brought up that Jim had a history of back problems and had undergone back surgeries before the altercation with Bradford. Medical records from treating surgeon Marcella Madera, M.D., were discussed, including progress notes following the assault which expressed concern but ultimately showed Jim's improvement post-surgery once scar tissue from prior surgeries was removed.

Verdict:
The court is likely to affirm in part and reverse and remand in part. Concerning the Turners' first point of error—the alleged award of a new easement to the Dudleys—the verdict will likely uphold the trial court's decision. The appellate court will determine that the Turners' argument about the trial court granting a new easement is unsupported by the record. Since the easement in question was established in the 1946 judgment and referred to in the 2008 agreed judgment without any expansion, the verdict on the easement dispute will stand without change.

Regarding the damages awarded to Jim for his medical conditions, the court will probably agree with the Turners that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the fight was the proximate cause of all of Jim's injuries. Although Madera's progress notes indicate concern that the fight could have worsened Jim's condition, they do not provide conclusive evidence on a reasonable medical probability. With the pain alleviated by removing scar tissue rather than direct damages from the altercation, the evidence cannot definitively link Jim's ongoing medical issues to the fight. Therefore, the court will likely rule that a lay jury could not reasonably establish a causal relationship without expert testimony and reverse Jim's award of damages.

Consequently, the court will remand the case for a new trial to accurately determine the damages directly attributable to the assault. This will necessitate professional medical testimony to make clear which of Jim's injuries, if any, were proximately caused by the altercation with Bradford. In all other regards, except for the awarded damages, the court will affirm the trial court's judgment without variation.
