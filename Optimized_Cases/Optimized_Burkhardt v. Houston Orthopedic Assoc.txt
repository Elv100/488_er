Background:
The appellant, Frederick Burkhardt, initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the appellee, Dr. Baker, stemming from the treatment of Burkhardt's shattered tibia sustained in March 1982. Dr. Baker, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, operated on Burkhardt and placed an internal fixation device in his leg to stabilize the fractured bone. Later, Burkhardt developed severe leg pain and was diagnosed with osteomyelitis, a bone infection, by Dr. Geraldine Miller, an infectious disease specialist, who advised removing the entire fixation device to effectively treat the infection. Dr. Baker, however, decided against removing it and only removed a loose screw during a subsequent surgery in July 1982. Dr. Miller observed the worsening infection and its additional complications, but it was not until September 1982 that Dr. Baker removed the fixation device following a new hospitalization.

Baker later applied an external fixation device and performed additional surgeries, including a bone graft and a skin graft. Despite these treatments, Burkhardt continued to suffer from osteomyelitis throughout 1983. In early 1984, he sought treatment from Dr. Michael Drew in Boston, who performed a successful debridement of the infection after administering antibiotics.

In May 1984, Burkhardt filed the lawsuit alleging negligence on the part of Dr. Baker for not removing the internal fixation device in July 1982. The jury found Dr. Baker negligent and also concluded this negligence proximately caused Burkhardt's injuries, awarding $237,500 in damages. The trial court, however, granted Dr. Baker's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), resulting in Burkhardt taking nothing. This decision prompted Burkhardt's appeal.

At trial, expert testimony supported the established standard of care, which dictated the removal of any internal fixation device in the presence of infection, barring the device's necessity for maintaining rigid bone fixation. The testimony of the experts, particularly Dr. Drew and Dr. Miller, highlighted the potential for an earlier cure of the infection and reduced complications had the device been promptly removed, as well as the extension of Burkhardt's suffering and the requirement for further surgeries due to the internal fixation device being left in place.

Verdict:
Given the ample and legally sufficient expert testimony presented at trial, which supported both the jury's findings of negligence and the proximate cause of Burkhardt's injuries being directly linked to that negligence, the appellate court will reverse the trial court's JNOV. The reasoning underlying this reversal will stress that the trial court's judgment is erroneous because substantial evidence of probative force exists, upon which the jury reasonably based its findings. The court will emphasize the congruence between the experts' opinions regarding the standard of care involving the treatment of osteomyelitis and the specifics of Burkhardt's situation.

The appellate court will likely reject the appellees' contentions that the evidence only suggests a possibility or conjecture regarding the proximate cause. Instead, the court will probably underscore the responsiveness and reliability of the expert testimony to questions of reasonable medical probability and its alignment with the jury's conclusions. Assertions that Burkhardt may have endured prolonged suffering even with the removal of the device are speculative and lack factual basis.

Additionally, the appellate court will most likely address the appellees' cross points of error, dismissing their arguments that the jury's determinations were not supported by factually sufficient evidence or against the great weight and preponderance of evidence. Since Burkhardt adequately met his burden in establishing negligence and proximate cause through evidence, the court will find no merit in these cross points and overrule them.

Consequently, by rendering a detailed judgment on the jury verdict, the appellate court will conclude that Burkhardt is entitled to the $237,500 in damages awarded by the jury, reinstating the original verdict in his favor.
