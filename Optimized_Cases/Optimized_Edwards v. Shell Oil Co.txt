Background:
H. T. Edwards, an employee of Kelley-Coppedge, sustained personal injuries on June 12, 1974, when he encountered an electrically charged guy line while operating a ditching machine for a pipeline construction project on property controlled by Shell Oil Company. The guy line had become loose and made contact with high voltage electrical lines. The case was initially directed to a verdict in favor of the defendants, Shell Oil Company and K & S Electric Company (who built the line), by the district court of Yoakum County, Texas. In the subsequent appeal, the plaintiff argued that there were disputed facts regarding the duty of the defendants and the proximate cause of his injuries, which should have been determined by a jury.

Evidence presented in the appeal showed that the guy line was either uninsulated or inadequately insulated, creating a dangerous condition on the property before the plaintiff undertook his work. Witnesses with substantial experience in working with high voltage electrical lines testified that guy line wires running above high voltage lines should have insulators sufficient to prevent them from becoming energized. The plaintiff's and defendants’ witnesses provided conflicting testimony regarding the guy line’s condition and the purpose of insulating such lines. Importantly, the location of the pipeline was determined by Shell, and a Shell representative had informed the supervisor of Kelley-Coppedge that adjustments to the pathway to avoid guy lines were not permissible.

The plaintiff himself, due to memory loss from the electric shock, could not recall the events leading up to the accident. It was established that the guy line entered the ground at an angle and continued at an angle underground, a fact unknown to the plaintiff. Shell and K & S contended that the plaintiff failed to prove the existence and violation of a legal duty, and that the injury arose from the plaintiff’s work activity. However, this contention is opposed by the evidence suggesting that the dangerous condition existed prior to plaintiff’s engagement on the property.

Verdict:
The court, in assessing the evidence and applying the law, will include in its reasoning that the issues of negligence, duty of care, and proximate cause were not appropriately resolved through an instructed verdict and should instead be submitted to a jury. As the facts are sharply disputed, particularly concerning the guy line's insulation and its maintenance, the court will find there is sufficient evidence to establish a legitimate dispute on these issues, substantiating a jury trial.

The court will dismiss the defendants' reliance on cases which assert no duty when no dangerous condition exists on the premises before the invitee's work begins. Instead, the court will draw comparisons with cases such as West Texas Utilities Co. v. Renner, which underscore the duty to maintain safe conditions around dangerous electricity conveyances, particularly when injury or consequences of a general nature could reasonably have been anticipated by the defendants.

On the subject of proximate cause, the court will articulate that both cause in fact and foreseeability are substantiated by the evidence. There is testimony that the presence and proper installation of insulators on the guy line would have prevented the injury sustained, and that the defendants could have foreseen the potential for the guy line to become loose and hazardous. Moreover, the passage of time since the installation by K & S and acceptance by Shell will be considered insufficient to abrogate potential negligence without evidence indicating that the guy line's condition had changed since its installation.

Given the presence of some evidence pointing to negligence by K & S in the construction and by Shell in the maintenance of the guy line, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, the court will conclude that a jury must decide the conflicting factual issues. Therefore, the verdict will include the reversal of the trial court's directed verdicts, consolidation of the severed cases against the two defendants, and remand the case for a new trial. The court will expect the jury to consider all the evidence presented to determine the defendants' responsibility for the plaintiff’s injuries.
