Background:
State Representative James F. Hury participated in an air show in October 1992, piloting his own aircraft. Upon landing, his plane entered a ground loop, coming to a stop on a neighboring runway. Moments later, another plane landed and collided with Mr. Hury's stationary aircraft. Mr. Hury, who was still inside the aircraft, sustained substantial injuries which resulted in his death. Mr. Hury was insured under a life insurance policy issued by Group Life and Health Insurance Company, which was managed by the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas (the appellant). His widow, Linda Benge, received $171,000 in term life benefits and additionally sought accidental death benefits. The claim for accidental death benefits was denied by the insurer based on an aviation exclusion in the policy, and the Board upheld this denial after a hearing.

Linda Benge sought judicial review, and the District Court of Travis County found that Mr. Hury was engaged in air travel or flight at the time of death, but the court required the Board to determine that the excluded activity was the proximate cause of death before applying the exclusion and denying benefits. Consequently, the matter was remanded to the Board for a proximate cause determination. The Board and Group Life disagreed with the district court’s mandate for a separate proximate cause finding and sought judicial review, leading to this appeal. Additionally, by cross-appeal, Ms. Benge contended that Mr. Hury was not engaged in air travel or flight at the time of the accident, hence the policy exclusion should not apply.

Verdict:
The court's decision will be to reverse the district court's judgment that remanded the case for a proximate cause determination and to affirm the Board's order denying accidental death benefits. The court will conclude that the Board, possessing exclusive authority to interpret the language of the insurance policy, reasonably determined that Mr. Hury was engaged in air travel or flight as covered by the aviation exclusion at the time of his death. Furthermore, the court will find that this excluded activity – air travel or flight – was not remote in time or circumstance from the resultant accident and injury; thus, it was a direct cause rather than an indirect or remote cause, aligning with the interpretation that the activity need not be the sole proximate cause but rather a proximate cause of loss.

The court's reasoning will encompass the principle that the aviation exclusion is intended to encompass a continuum of risk associated with flight, inclusive of landing, temporary stopping, and taxiing on the runway until safe disembarkation. The notion of intermittent coverage based on the plane's movement, or lack thereof, will be considered an arbitrary interpretation against the clear intent of the policy. The court will emphasize that proximate causation in the context of insurance exclusions requires the excluded risk to be a direct cause of the loss, not merely a contributing factor, which is incidental or remote. The court will assert that the application of Stroburg v. Insurance Co. of North America to require the excluded activity to be the sole proximate cause of death is neither necessary nor appropriate under the given circumstances for aviation exclusions. The court's affirmation of the Board’s order will be based on substantial evidence supporting that air travel or flight led to Mr. Hury's injuries and death, which falls squarely under the policy's exclusionary terms.
