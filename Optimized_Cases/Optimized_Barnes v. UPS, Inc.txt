Background:
Nathaniel Cooper, an employee of United Parcel Services, Inc. (UPS), died of a heart attack while working in a warehouse. He had a congenital heart block, had undergone several heart surgeries, and had a pre-existing heart condition. On the day of the incident, he was working light duty due to his heart condition. Following his death, his fiancée Terrica Barnes filed a workers' compensation claim as next of kin for their son, Kainan. The Texas Department of Workers' Compensation (DWC) found Cooper's heart attack to be the result of the natural progression of his pre-existing condition, not substantially contributed to by his work, and thus not compensable under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.

Barnes then filed a wrongful death lawsuit alleging gross negligence against UPS. She argued that UPS's failure to install an appropriate ventilation system and implement procedures to protect from high temperatures constituted gross negligence. UPS countered that the lawsuit was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel because the causation issue had been litigated and decided in the DWC hearing. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS based on these grounds. Barnes appealed, claiming the Texas Constitution and section 408.001(b) of the Texas Labor Code protected her right to seek exemplary damages for gross negligence. She further contended that the causation issues in the DWC hearing were not identical to those in the gross negligence suit, and therefore, collateral estoppel did not apply.

Verdict:
In the upcoming verdict, the court will likely reason that the gross negligence action is distinct from the workers' compensation claim heard by the DWC. The DWC's decision focused on whether Cooper's work was a substantial contributing factor to his heart attack under section 408.008 of the Texas Labor Code. The gross negligence claim, on the other hand, involves assessing whether UPS's conduct was a cause of injury and whether it was grossly negligent by being aware of, and acting with conscious indifference to, an extreme degree of risk. Therefore, the two issues are not identical, as the DWC decision required that work conditions be the dominant contributing factor – a higher causation burden than that of a gross negligence suit.

The court will also address the application of res judicata, concluding that it does not apply because the claim for exemplary damages based on gross negligence is not a claim that could have been raised in the DWC proceedings. The constitutional and statutory provisions protect the separate right of an heir or surviving spouse to pursue exemplary damages, which cannot be remedied through the administrative process established by the Texas Workers' Compensation Act.

Regarding collateral estoppel, the court will determine that the causation issues were not fully and fairly litigated during the DWC compensability hearing because the causation burden in the DWC hearing differs substantially from the one in a gross negligence lawsuit. In a gross negligence suit, the plaintiff needs to prove only that the defendant's conduct was a cause of injury, rather than the greater cause or the sole cause, whereas in a DWC hearing for a heart attack, the work conditions must be shown as a greater factor in comparison to the preexisting condition.

Consequently, the court will reverse the summary judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings, allowing Barnes to pursue her gross negligence lawsuit against UPS.
