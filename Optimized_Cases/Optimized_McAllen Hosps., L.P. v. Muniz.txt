Background:
This medical malpractice case involves the wrongful death action against McAllen Hospitals, L.P., and McAllen Medical Center, Inc., collectively referred to as "the Hospital," and Dr. Shahid Rashid. The appellees are the surviving spouse and children of Mr. Muniz, the deceased patient. After having his lower left leg amputated, Mr. Muniz suffered from pain, which was managed by Darvocet until Dr. Rashid prescribed a patient-control analgesia pump (PCA) to deliver Dilaudid (an opiate) intravenously. The administration of Dilaudid was not monitored adequately; dosage amounts were not recorded following its initiation by Nurse Duque. Hours after the PCA began, Mr. Muniz was found unresponsive with no pulse or respirations and subsequently pronounced dead.

The appellees’ expert witness, Dr. Rosner, testified that Mr. Muniz's death resulted from cardio-respiratory arrest due to the sedating effects of Dilaudid, which were compounded by his existing conditions (CHF, CAD, COPD). Dr. Rosner asserted that Mr. Muniz had exhibited sensitivity to opiates post-surgery, and that proper monitoring while on Dilaudid could have prevented his death. The Hospital challenged Dr. Rosner's testimony as speculative, claiming the expert’s reliance on mere assumptions and a lack of a reliable foundation under Tex. R. Evid. 702.

The trial court denied the Hospital's motions, including a motion for directed verdict, and the jury determined that the Hospital's negligence was the proximate cause of Mr. Muniz's death, while returning a verdict in favor of Dr. Rashid.

Verdict:
The verdict in favor of the appellees will likely be upheld on appeal. The reasoning for this verdict will rest on the conclusion that Dr. Rosner's expert testimony was both reliable and legally sufficient to support the jury’s finding. It will be determined that Dr. Rosner's opinion was grounded in his review of Mr. Muniz’s medical record, his professional experience as an anesthesiologist specializing in pain management, and knowledge in the field. The appellate court will perceive that he utilized objective criteria to reach his conclusion that the Hospital's failure to monitor Mr. Muniz's vital signs and oxygen saturation after administering Dilaudid was the proximate cause of his death.

The appellate court will find no "analytical gap" between the data and Dr. Rosner's opinion that would render his testimony as mere speculation or unsupported. The verdict will argue that the jury was within its rights to credit the testimony of Dr. Rosner over the Hospital's expert, Dr. Pallares, who had a differing interpretation of the medical records, and that the evidence presented furnished a reasonable basis for the jury's conclusion on causation.

Additionally, the verdict will conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the evidence was factually sufficient. The jury's role as the sole judge of credibility and the weight of testimony will be acknowledged, and it will be conceded that they reasonably believed Dr. Rosner's opinion on causation. Therefore, the verdict of the trial court will be affirmed, finding the Hospital's negligence as a substantial factor that resulted in Mr. Muniz's death and that the harm would not have occurred if the Hospital had not been negligent in monitoring Mr. Muniz post-Dilaudid administration.
