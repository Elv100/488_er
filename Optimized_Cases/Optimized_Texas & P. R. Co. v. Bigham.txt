Background:
The case involves a cattleman who has a prearranged agreement with a railway company to ship his cattle from Merkel to Waxahachie, Texas. On November 25, 1892, the cattleman penned approximately 100 head of cattle in the railway company’s stock pens, which were provided for that purpose. However, the gate to one of the pens was defective due to negligent maintenance by the railway company—a fact the company knew of but had not rectified for months. While attempting to secure the gate with a rope to prevent the cattle from escaping, a passing freight train spooked the animals into a panic. The cattle rushed the gate, resulting in it giving way and hurling the cattleman around twenty feet onto the ground, rendering him unconscious due to the impact.

In his lawsuit against the railway company, the cattleman sought damages for two claims: personal injuries sustained in the incident and damages to his cattle due to the defective gate of the stock pen. Within the legal proceedings, demurrers were filed, contesting that the injuries could not be proximately caused by the company's negligence. Despite this, the cattleman was successful at trial, attaining a favorable judgment for both claims of action, which was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.

Verdict:
Considering the existing legal principles and precedents, the verdict will likely differentiate between the claim of personal injuries and the claim regarding the injuries to the cattle. 

For the personal injury claim, the court will probably conclude that the railway company's negligence was not the proximate cause of the cattleman's injuries. Although the cattleman would not have been injured but for the defective gate latch, the immediate cause of his injuries was the independent event of the cattle being spooked by the freight train, which is an event the railway company could not have reasonably foreseen. In this instance, the occurrence of the freight train passing and the panic-induced stampede of the cattle represents an unforeseeable, intervening cause that legally disconnects the railway company’s negligence from the personal injuries sustained by the cattleman. The active cause of the personal injury was detached from the company's negligent maintenance of the gate, which means that the company's actions cannot be held as the proximate cause of the personal injury and, as such, do not give rise to a legal claim for those personal injuries.

On the other hand, the injuries to the cattle fall within the scope of foreseeable risks associated with the defective latch on the pen's gate—a condition that the company was aware of and neglected to repair. The railway company had an implied duty to safely contain the cattle, and it should have anticipated the possibility that the cattle might escape due to the defective latch and thereby cause loss to the cattleman. Furthermore, the railway company's liability as a common carrier had already attached when it took possession of the cattle for transport. Because it was within the realm of reasonable anticipation that the cattle could escape and cause economic harm, the court is likely to uphold the cattleman's claim for damages in relation to the cattle injuries.

Overall, the court will possibly reverse the trial court judgment on the personal injury claim due to the lack of proximate cause, while affirming the decision regarding the cattle's injuries, sending the case back for further proceedings consistent with the separation of these two claims.
