Background:
The petitioners, husband and wife Daryl and Faith May, sought health insurance coverage when health insurance was not provided by Daryl's employer. They decided on a health insurance policy shortly after their marriage in December 1982. Daryl's mother, Alice May, helped them inquire about health policies at Preston Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Preston"), where Daryl previously purchased auto insurance. Alice spoke with agent Rex Wiley who gave her a brochure for the "Double Eagle" group policy underwritten by Continental Bankers of the South ("Continental") available to members of the United Services Association of America ("United").

The Double Eagle policy had relatively low premiums and deductibles but included a termination provision allowing the underwriter to cancel the group coverage at any time and a deferral provision that deferred coverage for members who were hospitalized or totally disabled when coverage began.

In March 1983, Faith met with Wiley and discussed the policy. Despite not being informed of Continental's mediocre "C" rating from A.M. Best or alternative policies like an individual health policy from Reserve Life, the Mays unlocked maternity and dependent health coverage, joined United for a fee, and purchased the Double Eagle policy, which commenced on April 1, 1983.

In mid-1984, Continental terminated the United group policy, whereupon Hermitage Insurance Company ("Hermitage") took over with the same benefits. When Faith became pregnant, Wiley reassured her that Hermitage would maintain their coverage. However, by July 1985, Hermitage terminated the United group and Keystone Life Insurance Company ("Keystone") assumed control. Keystone classified the Mays' newborn son, Jared May, who was born with serious health conditions, as totally disabled, invoking the deferral provision and refusing to cover his medical expenses beyond a 90-day period after Hermitage’s termination. Jared was left uninsured until his death in November 1987.

The Mays filed suit alleging negligence and misrepresentation against Preston, United, Keystone, and Hermitage, but the latter two companies were severed from the case. The jury found that Preston and United's negligence proximately caused the Mays' injuries in failing to procure stable insurance coverage as requested, assessing causation at 40% and 60%, respectively. The jury awarded damages for unpaid medical expenses but not for mental anguish, and did not find gross negligence.

Preston appealed the jury's verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment of negligence liability, and upon further appeal, the Supreme Court was tasked with determining whether Wiley's actions constituted negligence and proximately caused the Mays' loss. The Supreme Court examined whether there was evidence of three alleged failures: negligence in selecting the Double Eagle policy, negligence in failing to investigate the financial solvency of Hermitage and/or Keystone, and negligence in placing coverage with potentially insolvent companies.

Verdict:
The Supreme Court reasoned that to reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, there must be evidence that any of Preston's alleged failures constituted negligence and proximately caused the Mays' loss. The first theory considered negligence in procuring the Double Eagle policy; however, the Mays were aware of the termination provision. Wiley recommended the policy to the Mays, but there was no specific negligent action identified, nor was there evidence of why the potential shifting of underwriters posed an unjustified risk specifically to the Mays. No evidence indicated Wiley should have prevented them from assuming such a risk or anticipated their unique circumstances, hence no blanket negligence claim could be established.

Regarding Wiley's failure to investigate the financial solvency of Hermitage and Keystone or to adequately investigate before placing coverage, it was noted that Hermitage and Keystone were not the underwriters when coverage was initially placed in 1983 (Continental was), and financial instability of these companies did not contribute to the loss since all claims were honored. No testimony indicated Hermitage's business decisions, which led to the policy being transferred and Jared's coverage at risk under the deferral provision, were due to financial instability.

The court also considered the jurisprudence regarding an agent’s duty to procure insurance, acknowledging established cases where agents were found liable due to a client's reasonable but detrimental belief that they were covered against certain risks – conditions not present in this case. Moreover, the court referenced cases that involved liability when the customer was misled about the coverage obtained. Although a more thorough discussion, disclosure of policy alternatives, or comparison of benefits would have constituted better service, Wiley's recommendation of the Double Eagle policy alone did not amount to negligence under Texas law.

Ultimately, the court determined there was no evidence to support the Mays' negligence theories as to any of the alleged failures. Wiley's decision in policy recommendation, despite being less than optimal, did not constitute negligence that proximately caused the Mays' injuries. The judgment would affirm the Court of Appeals' decision to reverse the trial court’s judgment, upholding that the Mays did not present evidence to satisfy their claims in the complaint—concluding that respondent agent Wiley did not breach his duty of care in a manner that proximately resulted in the plaintiffs' losses.
