Background:
Alan A. H. Boggs (Alan) and his girlfriend, Misty Robertson (Misty), attended a barbecue cook-off at the Astrodome on February 9, 1996. While leaving the parking lot in Alan's truck, Alan accidentally rear-ended a Nissan Maxima, causing minor vehicular damage. An altercation ensued between Alan and one of the Nissan's passengers, Barry Bergeron, which escalated into a physical fight. During the struggle, Bergeron fatally stabbed Alan with a knife, resulting in Alan's death at the scene. Bergeron was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.
  
The plaintiffs, Alan's parents, filed a wrongful death suit against Bottomless Pit, Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo, Inc., World Championship Barbecue Contest Committee, Bayou Teche, and Corral Club, Inc. (collectively referred to as appellees), who operated a booth selling beer and liquor at the event. They claimed the appellees were negligent for: 1) failing to establish and enforce guidelines for serving alcoholic beverages, 2) failing to provide adequate security, and 3) serving alcoholic beverages to an "obviously intoxicated" Bergeron, which they alleged was a proximate cause of Alan's death.

Appellees filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that they were not liable under the dram-shop law or for common law negligence because their alleged negligence was not the proximate cause of Alan's death.

The trial court granted summary judgment without specifying the grounds. The plaintiffs appealed, contending that there was a genuine issue of material fact concerning the foreseeability of violence by an intoxicated person and that the trial court erred by placing the burden of proof for the summary judgment on the nonmovant plaintiffs.

The summary judgment evidence included depositions, affidavits, and testimony from various witnesses, including Bergeron and Misty Robertson, who were directly involved in the incident, as well as expert opinions regarding Bergeron's level of intoxication and its correlation to violence.

Verdict:
The court's affirmation of the grant of summary judgment to the defendants will be based on the foreseeability of the criminal act that led to Alan's death. The court will find that the act of murder committed by Bergeron was not a foreseeable result of the sale of alcoholic beverages to him and that his intervening criminal act was the proximate cause of Alan's death. The court will hold that providing alcohol did not create a likelihood of such a criminal act, based on the evidence regarding Bergeron's behavior at the booth, where he did not appear aggressive, obnoxious, or looking for a fight, and there was no indication that the appellees should have anticipated his violent actions.

Additionally, expert affidavits suggesting that Bergeron was "obviously intoxicated" and that intoxication often leads to violence will be deemed insufficient to establish a fact issue regarding the foreseeability of his criminal conduct because they do not address any specific behavior by Bergeron at the event that would signal a propensity toward violence.

The court will also address the procedural objection brought by the appellants, arguing that the burden of proof was incorrectly placed on them and that the appellees did not formally plead their affirmative defense of an intervening or superseding cause. However, the court will determine that the appellants' argument is without merit because the affirmative defense was sufficiently raised in the appellees' summary judgment motion and the appellants did not object to the lack of a formal pleading. As such, the appellants failed to preserve this point of error for appeal. Given that the plaintiffs did not present evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue on the foreseeability of Bergeron's criminal conduct, the court will overrule both points of error by the appellants and affirm the summary judgment in favor of the appellees.
