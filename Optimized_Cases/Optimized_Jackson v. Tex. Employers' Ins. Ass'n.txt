Background:
The appellant, Jackson, a truck driver, filed a lawsuit against the appellee, Insurance Association, under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act, seeking damages for physical injuries sustained while performing his duties as a truck driver. Jackson's employer was a subscriber under the Compensation Act, with the defendant serving as the insurer. Jackson was on a multi-day haul when he suffered exposure to severe weather conditions, which he claimed caused his health issues. On the first day, he was caught in a rainstorm on an open prairie with no shelter from his truck to protect him. At night, he followed his employer's instructions for sleeping arrangements, only to find there was no shelter prepared for him, prompting him to sleep under an open shed. This resulted in him being soaked by another overnight rainstorm. The next day, while returning with his loaded truck, he was caught in another rainstorm, which led him to develop pneumonia and suffer swelling in a leg vein, leading to hospitalization and incapacity for work for over two months.

Jackson's application for compensation was rejected by the Texas State Industrial Board. He argued his injuries arose during employment; his employer's instructions subjected him to greater hazards than the general public; and that the injuries were not simply acts of God but rather the direct and natural result of his employment conditions. The insurer argued that Jackson's injuries did not fall within the Workmen's Compensation Act because they were not the result of an accident. The County Court of Wichita County sustained the insurer's general demurrer, prompting Jackson's appeal.

Verdict:
Upon review, the court will conclude that Jackson's injuries are compensable under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Act. While typically injuries caused by acts of God are not compensable, an injury resulting from an act of God will be compensated if the performance of the employee’s duties exposed him to greater hazards from the act of God than what applies to the general public. Jackson's employment conditions, which lacked essential shelter or adequate sleeping quarters, exposed him to the severe climatic conditions which led to his injuries. The performance of Jackson’s duties in these conditions directly contributed to his development of pneumonia and vein swelling. Therefore, his injuries would be deemed to have arisen out of his employment and are not excluded by the act of God provision in the Compensation Act. The court will reverse the judgment of the lower court that sustained the general demurrer to his petition and remand the action for further proceedings consistent with this interpretation of the law, asserting Jackson's right to recover under the act. The court's reasoning will reference legal precedents that support the compensability of injuries caused by weather conditions while performing duties that create exposure to elements beyond what the general public faces. It will emphasize that injuries need not be accidental under the Texas Act, and that the employment, with its unique exposure and demands, effectively brings Jackson within the protective ambit of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
