Background:
Angela Holder was driving late at night in downtown Houston when an on-duty Houston police officer, Calvin Potter, stopped her for an alleged traffic violation. Potter took Holder's insurance and identification cards, then instructed her to follow his patrol car. He directed her several blocks to a parking garage owned by Mellon Mortgage Company. Inside the garage, Officer Potter sexually assaulted Holder in his squad car.

Holder brought legal action against Mellon and the City of Houston for the incident but did not sue her attacker. The trial court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Mellon and the City on all claims by Holder. The court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the City based on sovereign immunity but reversed the summary judgment in favor of Mellon on Holder's claims for negligence, gross negligence, and loss of consortium.

In the litigation, Mellon contended that it owed no legal duty to Holder. The court focused on the issue of foreseeability, specifically whether Mellon could have foreseen that a person would be accosted elsewhere and then forced to drive to its property, where they would be assaulted. The contention was that the attack was not foreseeable to Mellon since respondent was not in a position that could have made her a victim of a third-party criminal act within the foreseeability of the property owner. Mellon claimed it owed no duty to prevent the assault.

Holder's claims against Mellon asserted that the assault was indeed foreseeable given the location of the parking garage in a high-crime area. Further, Holder pointed to evidence such as 190 violent crimes reported near the garage in the two years preceding the incident, a frequency of roughly one violent crime every four days. Additionally, the garage had experienced property crimes, including the theft of an employee's car, and complaints about the lack of security. There had also been reports of vagrants frequently occupying the garage and sometimes drinking there.

Verdict:
The court will reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that Holder take nothing. The court's reasoning will be based on the analysis of "foreseeability" related to premises liability cases. Although the court will acknowledge that a crime occurring in the parking garage was within the realm of possibility given the rate of violent crimes in the nearby area, the court will determine that Holder was not within a class that Mellon could have reasonably anticipated being subject to a criminal act in the garage.

Mellon's owed duty to prevent foreseeable crimes will be defined by factors including the similarity, proximity, recency, frequency, and publicity of previous crimes. The court will extrapolate from the specifics of past crimes to determine foreseeable risks. Despite the history of property crimes in the garage, the court will decide that Mellon could not have reasonably foreseen a sexual assault taking place there, in particular to someone in Holder's circumstances.

The court will reiterate that foreseeability requires that the general type of injury be anticipated, not the precise event, and the injured party should be within an anticipated range of victims. In this case, Mellon's alleged failure to secure the parking garage at night is not related closely enough to the wrongful act—Officer Potter's decision to commit the assault herein—such to render Mellon liable. Additionally, Mellon's steps to provide armed security patrols during weekdays, and random patrols by off-duty police officers during business hours, will be seen as measures acknowledging some level of risk but not indicative of foreseeability related to Holder's specific incident.

Therefore, the court will conclude that Mellon met the requisite standard for a property owner in its position and that Mellon did not breach a legal duty to Holder as her injury was not a reasonably foreseeable outcome of the garage's condition, nor did Mellon have reason to anticipate such a victimization occurring on its property.
