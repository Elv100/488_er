Background:
In November 1987, Joe Pickle, an employee of LTV Aerospace and Defense Co. (LTV), was killed when he was crushed between a hangar door and a wall at LTV's premises. The hangar was being renovated, which included relocating door control switches to a security booth for access control. In February 1987, LTV contracted with Bel-Ton Electric Service, Inc. (Bel-Ton) to move these switches. Bel-Ton relocated one set of switches but left another set on the hangar’s east wall, contending that their contract did not mandate moving these switches.

After the relocation by Bel-Ton, an LTV computer programmer jammed one of the east wall switches to discourage personnel from using the hangar door as a shortcut to the restrooms, leading to the hangar door operating unexpectedly. When Joe Pickle opened the hangar door using the relocated switches and attempted to change light bulbs, he was unexpectedly caught and crushed as the hangar door closed due to the other jammed switch.

Suzie Y. Pickle and National Union Fire Insurance Co. filed a lawsuit against Bel-Ton, contending that it was negligent for not moving both sets of hangar door switches, which they argued was a proximate cause of Joe Pickle’s death. Bel-Ton contended that it was not contractually obliged to move the second set of switches, the possibly "jammable" switch was not modified by them, and that the jamming of the switch by the LTV employee was an unforeseeable, intervening cause that excused them from liability.

The trial court ruled against Bel-Ton, finding its failure to relocate all switches a proximate cause of the death. The court refused Bel-Ton’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and denied its motion for a credit on compensatory damages for $345,000 paid by LTV to Mrs. Pickle in an out-of-court settlement. Bel-Ton submitted that this credit should be applied on the basis that both defendants were responsible for the same damages, and that the settlement compensated for the same injury for which Bel-Ton was found liable. Bel-Ton appealed the decision.

Verdict:
The evidence presented suggests that Bel-Ton had a duty to create safe conditions, which it breached by not relocating both sets of switches. There is credible testimony that not moving both sets of switches to the security booth was negligent and contributed to creating an unsafe condition that was a proximate cause of Joe Pickle’s death. The foreseeability aspect of proximate cause is likely satisfied because Bel-Ton could or should have anticipated that leaving two sets of operational switches could lead to unpredictable and hazardous situations. 

Additionally, the accident investigator Edward Campbell affirmed that having two operational switches controlling one door created an unsafe condition. Charles Rovell, lead safety engineer at LTV, also testified that the accident might not have occurred if Bel-Ton had removed the east-wall switches as he had expected them to do based on the blueprints.

The act of the LTV employee in jamming the switch is likely not a superseding intervening cause because the potentially harmful situation was already in existence due to Bel-Ton's negligence. Both legal and factual sufficiency exist to support the jury's findings because there is significant evidence that Bel-Ton's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the accident and the injury was foreseeable. Consequently, given the evidence, it is probable that the appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision, determining that Bel-Ton was a proximate cause of the decedent’s death, and it will validate the trial court's refusal to grant Bel-Ton’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.

Concerning the settlement credit, without evidence of the terms of the LTV settlement (allegedly for exemplary damages for gross negligence), the appellate court will not be able to determine if the set-off requested is applicable under the "one satisfaction" rule. If it's proven that the settlement with LTV covered exemplary damages only, and Bel-Ton’s liability pertains solely to actual damages for simple negligence, Bel-Ton will not be entitled to the credit. Absent evidence of the terms of the settlement agreement, Bel-Ton will fail in its burden of proof, and the appellate court will likely reject the claim for credits towards the judgment based on the earlier settlement by LTV.
