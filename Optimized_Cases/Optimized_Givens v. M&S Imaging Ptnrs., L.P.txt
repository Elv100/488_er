Background:
A plaintiff mother, on behalf of herself and her infant daughter, brought a negligence lawsuit against an ultrasound technician and various companies after the technician allegedly produced a substandard ultrasound image. The mother had a history of a diagnosed short cervix and had received a cervical cerclage in a previous pregnancy to prevent premature delivery. However, the technician's measurement indicated that the mother's cervix was longer than it actually was, leading to the mother not being given a cerclage. As a result, the mother delivered prematurely, and her child, Toni Wright, suffered injuries. The child required extended hospitalization due to a congenital lung disease, often associated with premature birth. Eventually, Toni suffered severe brain damage at home due to a clogged breathing tube.

Daigle (technician) and her codefendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment, claiming a lack of proximate cause. The trial court granted the motion. The mother appealed, but the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision. The appellate court reviewed the case to determine if the evidence showed Daigle's actions were a proximate cause of the damages or if the sequence of events was too attenuated to connect Daigle's actions to the injuries sustained.

The summary judgment evidence included conflicting information about the ultrasound's adequacy and the quality of the resulting images. Radiologist Godwin, who issued a report to Givens' obstetrician, claimed to have conducted an independent review of the ultrasound films and did not rely on Daigle's measurements. He did not include cervical length in his report, stating it was well visualized in the images he reviewed.

The mother alleges a chain of causation that begins with the flawed ultrasound and leads to a series of events culminating in her daughter's brain damage due to oxygen deprivation from the clogged tube.

Verdict:
The verdict will uphold the summary judgment in favor of Daigle and the other defendants. The reasoning will be that Daigle’s alleged negligence in performing the ultrasound is too attenuated from the damages of medical expenses incurred during Toni's initial hospitalization and the subsequent brain damage. Although the ultrasound might have contributed to the premature birth, Daigle's actions do not rise to the level of proximate cause because they did not actively contribute to the ultimate injuries suffered by Toni, particularly the brain damage resulting from the clogged breathing tube, which occurred through a series of independent events too removed from Daigle's conduct.

The court will likely invoke the principle that cause in fact requires the negligent act to be a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, without which the harm would not have occurred. Because the radiologist's report did not rely on Daigle’s ultrasound and he made an independent assessment of the cervical length, the report cannot be seen as flowing directly from Daigle’s alleged negligent act. Furthermore, the ultrasound did not actively cause Toni's brain damage. The court will further note that other medical assessments occurred after the ultrasound, creating additional opportunities for the shortened cervix to be discovered. Hence, Daigle's actions, while possibly contributing to the premature birth, did not override subsequent medical decision-making in a manner that would establish legal causation.

In conclusion, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed, maintaining that Daigle and her co-defendants were correctly granted summary judgment based on the evidence presented.
