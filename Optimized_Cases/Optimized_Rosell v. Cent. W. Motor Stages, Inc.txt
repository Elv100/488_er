Background:
In the early morning hours of January 31, 1998, Karen Bay's car collided with a retaining wall on Interstate Highway 35. Bay exited the vehicle and was on the lane near the HOV lane. Chad Rosell stopped to assist Bay. Loyd Rieve, driving a Central West bus, attempted to pass the accident in the HOV lane, driving at least fifty miles per hour, striking and killing Chad. The plaintiffs, Chad's survivors, filed a wrongful death and survival action against Central West, Rieve, and Bay. Central West accepted that Rieve was operating within his employment scope. The trial court excluded Central West from the apportionment question, addressing only Rieve, Bay, and Chad's negligence. The jury found actual damages of $809,312.96, found Central West grossly negligent, and awarded $1,250,000.00 in punitive damages. However, fault for Chad's death was apportioned as 70% to Chad, 20% to Rieve, and 10% to Bay. Under Texas law, because Chad’s fault exceeded 50%, a take-nothing judgment was rendered against the plaintiffs. On appeal, issues raised by the plaintiffs included the trial judge's qualifications, jury submission errors regarding liability and apportionment questions, error in omitting instructions on the Good Samaritan and rescue doctrines, factual insufficiency supporting the negligence apportionment, punitive damages exclusion, and an improper jury influence claim.

Verdict:
The judgment was affirmed by the appellate court, which found no reversible errors in the trial proceedings. The trial judge’s suspension of his law license for nonpayment of bar dues and subsequent reinstatement were deemed not appropriate grounds for appeal, as he was still considered a de facto judge. The appellate court agreed that Central West's inclusion in the ordinary negligence liability question was unnecessary since respondeat superior established liability based on Rieve's negligence. Further, gross negligence claims justified the separate jury questions regarding Central West’s negligent entrustment, hiring, supervision, and retention. The jury had discretion in allocating responsibility and their finding that Chad was 70% at fault was supported by sufficient evidence, despite conflicting testimony. There was no jury misconduct warranting a new trial since information about court scheduling did not qualify as an outside influence on the deliberations that could affect the verdict. Lastly, because the Rosells were barred from recovering actual damages due to Chad's percentage of fault, they could not receive punitive damages, notwithstanding the jury's findings of Central West's gross negligence.
